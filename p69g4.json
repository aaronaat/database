      "description": "<i>Reversi</i> is a computerized version of the board game Othello. During the game, two players take turns placing game pieces on the board in an attempt to trap pieces of their opponents color. Any trapped pieces will then be reversed in color. When the board becomes completely filled up, whomever has the most pieces of his own color on the board wins. The game can be played by two players, or one player against the computer. There are three skill levels the computer can use, and three different board sizes are available, 6 by 6, 8 by 8, and 10 by 10.",

There are three different types of fighters roaming throughout the galaxy; cruisers, fighters, and basestars. With the help of your galactic map, you can find the sectors of the galaxy where these fighters are located and then warp there to destroy them. When all of the fighters in a sector are destroyed, you can warp to a new location for the next battle. Be sure to keep an eye on your starship's energy level; warping to new locations, being hit by enemy fire, or colliding with an asteroid will drain your energy. If you completely run out of energy, your starship will be destroyed, however you can warp back to a starbase to refuel at any time. Returning to a starbase will also repair other types of damage your starship can receive, such as faulty engines, loss of your shields, and faulty photon torpedoes. When all of the enemy ships have been destroyed, you win the game and receive a rank.\n",

The computer controls both your partner and your opponents, either of which can be set to an expert or novice skill level. In the novice game, you will be able to see your partners hand while bidding while in the expert game your partners hand remains hidden. For each game, you can choose to play to either 13, 21, 25, or 29 points. After a hand is finished, you have the option of replaying the same hand if you want to practice, or you can have the computer deal a new hand. If you don't like the way a hand is going, you have the option of restarting the hand to try again. Included with the game instructions is a complete guide to how your computer partner will bid in different situations in order to help you form your strategy. Bridge was designed for people who already know how to play the game, it won't teach you how to play.",

This is accomplished by moving your pieces diagonally forward on the board; an opponent's piece is removed from play if one of your pieces jumps over it (if any of your pieces are able to jump an opponent's piece, you must make that move). When beginning the game pieces can only move in a diagonal forward direction until they reach the other side of the board; that piece then becomes 'kinged' allowing movement both forwards and backwards. \n\nThe game can be played by one player against the computer (with three skill levels available) or two players against each other.",

You and Flo build a restaurant empire through 50 levels in five different restaurants of seating customers, taking their orders, serving their food, and cleaning up after them. Speedy service and good atmosphere is needed to keep the customers happy, and keeping them happy is the best way to get huge tips.\n\nThe player must balance service for the five different customer types, each with their own quirks. For example, the business lady is very impatient, but eats very fast and gives very big tips, while the senior citizen is extremely patient, slow to eat, and cheap (he's got to save his retirement money, after all). There are also two chain systems to keep track of, a service chain for doing the same service multiple times in a row, and a seating chain for seating customers of the same color in the same seat.\n\nThe Wii, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 versions support multiplayer games - cooperative, competitive (with tip wars for instance, where the first player to reach a certain amount of tips, wins), and team based with up to 8 players.",

Three countries face off in a new way each trying to maintain their own sovereignty. The game puts you in control of six different role type hounds (Soldier, Sniper, Defender, Scout, Heavy Gunner, and Tactics Commander). Play through missions where you use each different role type and gain parts to build your own hounds. Then take the battle online where you can make your own squads and join the online campaign to see which of the three countries will reign supreme.",

      "description": "This is an early home chess game. The standard U. S. chess rules are used in this game. To move a piece, place the X on the board onto the piece to be moved then press the red button. Next, move the X to where you want the piece to go and press the button again. If the move is illegal, the 2600 will give a warning sound and not make the move.\n\nTo castle your king, the king and rook must not have been moved. You move your king two squares in the direction of the rook to castle with. The 2600 will then automatically move your rook around your king, completing the move. You cannot castle out of check and you cannot castle to the king's side if any squares between the king and rook are threatened.\n\nAnother maneuver is called en passant. This move is used to counteract the enemy pawn's initial double move on a adjacent square.  To carry out the en passant, you must advance your\npawn to the fifth rank.  Your opponent then has the option of moving\nhis or her pawn one square (where it would be under attack) or two\nsquares.  If you opponent elects to move two squares, the en passant move allows you to take that pawn by diagonally moving your pawn to the square that was skipped over.\n\n<b>Skill levels</b><br>\nThese determine how long the computer will think on its move. These times are approximate and may vary slightly, depending on what move you did.<br>\nLevel 1=15 seconds<br>\nLevel 2=30 seconds<br>\nLevel 3=45 seconds<br>\nLevel 4=2 minutes, 45 seconds<br>\nLevel 5=3 minutes, 15 seconds<br>\nLevel 6=12 minutes<br>\nLevel 7=10 hours<br>\nLevel 8=10 seconds\n\nLevel 8 is a beginner level.",

EA makes use of Tolkien's other works, giving players with nearly all of the author's mythos.\n\nIn this game, the Good and Evil sides have been divided into races: you can now control Elves, Dwarves and Men of West (on the Good side) and Isengard, Mordor and the Goblins (on the Evil side) independently. Still of vital importance are the heroes. The game also allows you to make your own custom hero units - including role, appearance and powers. New to Battle for Middle Earth II are naval units and naval combat.",

You manage an interstellar space station with various ports that can be equipped for space travellers, constantly balancing operating costs against revenue. You can focus on entertainment, commercial activities or science, but you also have to construct buildings, provide enough power and repair all your structures. Every port can be micromanaged for content and price, and you can upgrade to new expansions and sell the old ones. At the same time, you have to keep an eye out for alien attacks or asteroids.\n\nThere are two story modes: Adventure and War, with goals for each mission, based on shielding off attacks, constructing buildings or getting revenues. There are seven races and 50 space stations to play with. Like most tycoon games, there is also a sandbox mode where you can play without objectives or restrictions. Soon after the release, additional scenarios and picture packs were made available.",

Try to be the first to discard all of your cards from your hand, but don't forget to call \"Uno!\" when you only have one card remaining!  Aside from the standard numbered cards, there also special cards like \"Draw Two\", which makes your next opponent pick up two cards, \"Skip\", which skips the next player's turn, \"Reverse\", which reverses the direction of play, and the dreaded \"Wild Draw Four\", which lets you change the color of the deck to any color of your choice, as well as making your next opponent pick up four cards!\n\nThe Xbox 360 version of Uno is highly customisable.  You can choose to play with standard rules (be sure to call \"Uno!\" when you only have one card left, or you can be punished by picking up two more cards).  If the standard play is not to your taste, you can choose your own rules of play to make Uno more like the version you play at home.  Change anything from the amount of points required to win, to enabling or disabling the ability to challenge certain cards, to changing the amount of cards you must pick up for a Draw Two, and much more!\n\nIf solo Uno is not your thing, you can also play Uno with up to three players over Xbox Live.  You can also use the Xbox Live Vision Camera to see your friends online.  Also available are additional card packs which can be downloaded from Xbox Live Marketplace to provide different rules and cards.",

He becomes more distant from Third Echelon.  In fact, he even goes so far as to get himself arrested.\n\nBut it's all part of the plan.  Sam Fisher is now a double agent, working for both the NSA and a terrorist organization known as the JBA, or John Brown's Army.  Sam is for the most part a good guy still.  But will that remain?  Will Sam do good for the NSA and bring the organization to justice, or will the lure of the terrorist group overpower and overcome Sam?\n\nThe choices you make affect that outcome.  Moral questions will pop up in various places throughout the game.  Do you shoot a prisoner to earn trust with the JBA, or do you hold off, keeping the NSA on your side?  Whatever outcome you decide on, your trust with one will go down and the other will go up.  This trust system is a new addition to Double Agent.\n\nAs you work your way through ten missions, your best friends are shadow and silence.  You can go in guns blazing, but you won't get far.  As a master spy, Sam will have to sneak around crates and walls, hide under vehicles and tables, sneak through highly guarded areas, and bypass electronic, fingerprint, voiceprint and retinal locked doors.  You must interrogate or hack for keycodes and combinations, and you have the choice of knocking an enemy unconscious or killing them.  When hanging by a rail, you can let an enemy guard walk by, or reach up, grab him and throw him to his death.  Your best weapon is your mouth.  Lure an enemy to your location by whistling, then sneak around him as he abandons his patrol to find the source of the noise.  Your configurable weapon is really a backup.\n\nSam will go on many missions as a double agent.  You'll be visiting the JBA headquarters in New York City, you'll travel to the Congo to rescue a soldier, you'll board a cruise ship in Cozumel wearing shorts in broad daylight with minimal cover, forcing you to change your stealth patterns.  You'll wind up in the middle of a wartorn city, in the middle of a battle between guerrillas and the military, both of which want you dead.  Your missions are varied, and all can be completed without firing a single bullet.\n\nMultiplayer is similar to the past Splinter Cell games.  You take on the role of either a spy or a mercenary; spies are played from the standard, third-person perspective, while mercs are played from the first-person perspective.  Spies are tasked with stealing sensitive documents; mercs are tasked with killing the spies and protecting the documents.  Each side has its own unique weapons and items.  Spies do not have conventional weaponry, meaning nothing that can kill a merc, but they have several gadgets and devices to help them.  Mercs are blessed with a high-powered rifle, grenades, and the ability to toggle various vision modes.\n\nThe PS3 version includes some additional content: a new female spy character (multiplayer), two new maps based on a new environment (multiplayer), a new set of co-op challenges and some refinements for the existing content.",

      "description": "Star Trek Legacy begins a few years after the end of the TV-series Star Trek Enterprise. Starfleet is growing fast and new technologies have been introduced like the tractor beam or starbases. You take the helm of the starship Enterprise NX-01 which has been heavily upgraded with all the cutting edge technology and your mission is to find a missing Vulcan ship. During the campaign you play get the chance to play all the great ships from the five series up to the USS Voyager under the command of Captain Janeway. All five captains (Archer, Kirk, Picard, Sisko, Janeway) are voiced by their actors from the TV-series.\n\nYou control your ship either directly with the keyboard or by giving orders to your helm on a map of the current sector or by marking planets or enemies in directly on the screen. Depending on how good you solved a mission, you earn command points with which you can buy up to 4 ships. They function like a squad. You can either give them individual commands like defend this position or take the lead and tell them to do, what you do. If you aren't satisfied with the actions of your individual ships, you can take over the helm yourself at any time.\n\nDuring the campaign you only take control over ships of the United Federation of Planets and fight against Klingons, Romulans and the Borg. But in skirmish as well as in multiplayer, you can take either side yourself and fight against up to 4 other players or together against a common threat in coop in which each player takes control over one ship of the squad.\n\nAlso there's much fighting with enemy ships, your mission goals include escorting medical ships to poisoned planets or defending planets against incoming asteroids.",

These include a new default GUI created with the aid of user feedback in an attempt to make it more user friendly. \n\nThe game also includes pre-match team talks. In the previous edition, only half-time and full-time team talks could be given. The game has also increased functionality of the half-time team talk, managers can now target individual opposition players for special attention, such as instructing players to close them down or always to tackle them with force. \n\nA significant new addition is the ability to create a feeder club affiliation. This allows larger clubs to set up a relationships with a smaller club and vice versa. This can be used by users managing larger clubs to loan out players to their feeder club to gain the first team experience that they are unable to get at higher levels. On the other hand, the smaller clubs can benefit from the ability of these players. \n",

      "description": "Three opposing sides - the Cybran Nation, the Aeon Illuminate and the United Earth Federation - have been fighting in the Infinite War all across the galaxy, spreading chaos and unrest. You are a Supreme Commander and you have to take one of the sides and put an end to this war.\n\nAs in most strategy games, you have to build up a base, gather resources and build armies to fight off your enemies. But being created by Chris Taylor of Total Annihilation fame, the RTS also has many unique features, such as a huge unit cap of 500 units per side, different resource management, queue up commands and waypoints, diverse unit types and even dual screen support.\n\nPlayers can play through the Campaign and carry on the story as one of the sides, or fight off computer enemies in Skirmish and human opponents in Multiplayer.\n\nThe Xbox 360 version has redesigned controls and HUD. The game uses circular controls to replace the many short-cuts and buttons. The right stick is used to zoom in or out quickly. It also includes new units, updated maps and two new multiplayer modes (King of the Hill - defend a strategic point, and Command Point - capture as many civilian buildings as possible), available to play over Xbox Live with four players simultaneously.",

      "description": "It's the year 1941 and you are Lt. Henry Walker a young Navy Officer stationed at Pearl Harbor. You are late for duty and on route to your ship as the Japanese attack the harbor and sink it. Now you first help to defend the harbor and then take the fight all the way to the last Battle of the pacific around the Midway Islands.\n\nYou are limited to control the ships, subs and planes the game gives you in the single-player campaign but in multiplayer-matches you are free to jump into anything that moves and isn't currently occupied by another player. So it's yours to decide at anytime if you want to fly a plane, steer a cruiser or take the on the enemy under water with a submarine anytime you like. Since there are several kinds of ships from Torpedo Boats over Destroyers to Aircraft Carriers and planes like the F4F Wildcat or the SBD Dauntless you have different options and weapons at your disposal. On a Aircraft Carrier for example, which has only AA guns, you can build up squads of airplanes, assign targets and launch them. You can also go to the tactical map if you currently controlling a ship and assign formations, give out orders and so on. Or just jump into a vehicle and do everything yourself instead of letting the AI or the other players take care of it.\n\nThe single-player also features three different challenges, one for each type of vehicle. Each mission inside a challenge puts you in difficult situations you've to master. The first mission in the ship challenge for example gives you control over a Japanese Battleship which has been ambushed and needs to reach safety as US Destroyers advance at it's position.",

      "description": "One day a meteor fell on Earth, spreading a new substance called Tiberium. This substance was unusual and powerful, yet highly dangerous since it turned anything it touched into Tiberium itself. By 2047, Tiberium has spread and infested most of the Earth's surface, causing an ecological catastrophe. Red Zones are areas rendered inhabitable due to the severe Tiberium infestation and constant Ion storms, covering 20% of the planet's surface. Yellow Zones are areas infested by Tiberium but they hold most of the world's population. These areas are filled with civil unrest and are war-torn and ravaged but cover 50% of the planet's surface. The remaining areas are Blue Zones, areas safe from Tiberium infestation and possibly the only salvation for humanity, covering 20% of the planet's surface.\n\nThe Global Defense Initiative upkeeps the Blue Zones, keeping them defended and using special technology to keep the Tiberium infestation at bay, while the Brotherhood of Nod takes advantage of the chaos and civil unrest in the Yellow Zones to recruit their forces. However, they hadn't been heard of for years, supposedly disappeared... until now. Kane returns, commanding the Brotherhood of Nod once again to launch a serious assault against the Global Defense Initiative and its Blue Zones, starting the Third Tiberium War.\n\nFollowing the tradition of the series, <i>Command & Conquer 3</i> is designed to be a fast-paced game, where players build up their bases to produce a powerful fighting force to destroy their enemies. Being able to play for any of the three sides, they'll have a huge selection of infantry, vehicles and aircraft to fight with, as well as structures to aid with new technologies, upgrades and the all-powerful superweapons. Unlike most games of the genre, players do all their building from a tabbed sidebar, allowing them to create production queues and deploy structures quickly and easily. Maps also have various buildings spread around which can either be garrisoned to provide further protection or captured to give players that extra edge.\n\nIn campaign mode you can fight the war for one of the games sides, playing out the storyline through various missions with high-definition FMVs and popular actors giving you orders, and winning medals based on your performance. You can also play in skirmish against the AI, or in multiplayer (network/online) against human/computer players. Online play has support for rankings, clans, VoIP, and a new feature called BattleCast, enabling players to watch or download replays from battles directly from the website, or even provide commentary like an online sport.\n\nThe Xbox 360 version is fairly identical but altered for the console's controls. The interface has been moved to the bottom left on the screen and the tabs on the right have been replaced by context-sensitive menus players can scroll through using the D-pad. Selecting and building units or constructions is done through the A-button and the triggers. The buildings show processes without having to select them. A tutorial explains the controls and advanced players can also create custom shortcuts. The Xbox 360 version supports the Xbox Live Vision camera.",

Each turn consists of two parts: empire control, and war making. Your territories bring you tax revenue each turn, which you can spend on various different actions. You can create items and tactics for your generals to use in battle. Recruit generals and troops, fortify your territories, among many other command options. You can wage war on other territories, or may be called upon to defend your own. For each battle you select which generals and lieutenants will fight. There are 4 scenarios to unlock, though they offer little to differentiate each other.\n\nThere is two player split-screen co-op, in either of Empire of Free play modes. Next to the soundtrack of the base game, this edition also adds soundtracks from previous titles, including Dynasty Warriors 2, Dynasty Warriors 3 and Dynasty Warriors 4.",

      "description": "<i>Carcassonne</i> is a turn-based strategy game for 2 to 5 players based on the German board game of the same name. By playing land tiles one by one, players build up a landscape of cities, roads, farms, and monasteries. Players compete to claim control of the features they build with a limited supply of follower pieces. Judging where to play the tiles and when to use a follower or not is a deceptively simple process - yet the depth of the game stems from judging when and where to use the followers to gain the most points.\n\nSince the land tiles are random for each game, it has infinite replayability. Knowing which tiles are still left in the \"deck\" is a bit like counting cards in blackjack - the skilled player will beat the luck of the draw every time. Therefore one-to-one games play quite differently than with 4 or 5 players.\n\nThe game is playable with 4 players on the same console on one TV in roughly 15 minutes and also with 5 players via Xbox Live. Next to the base game it also includes the \"The River\" expansion by default. It builds a river of 12 extra tiles before each game, dividing the land in halves.",

      "description": "<i>Bladestorm: The Hundred Years' War</i> has players take control of a mercenary for hire during the legendary English / French conflict. Lead soldiers, warriors and fellow swords for hire into battle on horseback or on foot, fighting alongside Joan of Arc or the King of England as you strive to become the mercenary champion and gain fame and fortune during these dark times.\n\nThe gameplay takes place in a 3rd-person perspective and takes the form of an action / RPG of sorts. The 'central hub' of the game is a local bar where the player attempts to find jobs that will increase his or her wealth and reputation, as well as dealers that will allow the player to change weaponry or buy more troops to fight alongside them. This hub area also serves as a meeting place for characters from the game world and the player may gleam information from gossip heard that will help them later in-game. Talking to the barman within will present a roster of missions available, the length of that particular campaign and the reward for success - these can take place on either the English or French side (you cannot ally with just one faction). Selecting one of these missions will take you to the battlefield.\n\nThe main game itself is broken down into what first appears to be a strategy sort of game in which the player is shown which territories they have to take to successfully complete the mission - however any strategic element ends here. They can then select which 'home camp' to start from. Once this is chosen they are presented with a battlefield (similar in respects to dynasty warriors). The main objective is to make their way to the castle / village to be taken and successfully seize it from the occupying troops. battling with any enemy troops they encounter along the way. \n\nThe player can command a number of differing types of combatants, from archers to footsoldiers to horseback, and later on in-game camel and elephant riders. Battles are a simple hack and slash affair, with the player attempting to clear the area of enemy troops. Once this has been achieved a base commander will appear at the base under siege. Beat this commander and the player will have seized the territory and completed the mission. Extra fame can be achieved from beating in combat the VIP enemies found throughout the mission. This in turn will also yield treasure for the player, some of which is collectible throughout the game.\n\nAs such, <i>Bladestorm</i> has no end - the player will continue to fight battles as they progress (This is after all the Hundred Years' War!), but there is a story arc within the game to be completed, and the amount of missions - although very similar can give players a lot game content to keep them happy.",

The player assume the role of a colonist, modelled after famous leaders, on the imaginary island of Catan. Through strategy and trading, three to four players vie for control over the valuable territory and resources of this uncharted wilderness. Game modes include AI opponents, matches against human players over Xbox Live and ranked competitive play. A certain amount of rules can be tweaked for these games.\n\nThe game board is composed of nineteen randomly arranged hexagonal tiles. Each of them represents a certain resource. Players can build roads, establish settlements or raise armies to earn victory points. The first to reach ten points wins. Gameplay is turn-based, with timers to keep the pace steady. The playing field is shown through a flat, top-down overview or a 3D render. Voice chat is supported, but thoughts can also be communicated through graphical emotions - even to the use of influencing other players' strategy or decisions.",

      "description": "The sixth main game in the long running Dynasty Warriors series (or fifth if one goes by the original Japanese naming scheme) once again allows the player to take a legendary hero from the quasi-historical novel \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\" into battle against thousands of enemy peons. The player needs to battle his way through numerous battlefields, capturing forts and succeeding in objectives in order to bring about victory for his faction. It is an action game with traces of strategy when the player is faced with how to achieve certain sub-missions during a battle.\n\nIt is the first of the series to be designed specifically for Xbox 360/Playstation 3 generation of consoles and graphically makes better use of their hardware, allowing for sharper detail and more enemies on screen. New elements include a redesigned combo system, called \"Renbu\" where longer, though less varied, attack strings can be made and the ability to climb and swim.\n\nContrary to tradition of past games in the series, <i>Dynasty Warriors 6</i> offers <i>fewer</i> characters than before. Forty one characters are eventually unlocked, but only seventeen have story modes, each designed specifically for that character. The others can be used in the game's free mode and can be built up and obtain weapons and skills.\n\nThe Playstation Portable and Playstation 2 release adds 6 new character story modes and 5 new stages not found in the Xbox 360/Playstation 3.  The PSP version also adds Meng Huo from Dynasty Warrior 6: Empires as a playable character.",

The game now supports four players online multiplayer play via Xbox Live with complete leaderboards and rankings. Other improvements include the ability to unlock various items and the graphical customization of in-game avatars, and high resolution graphics, partially rendered in 3D.\n\nThe game also includes a story mode, revolving around a young man who is sold into slavery in order to provide economic relief for his struggling village. Now he must fight over multiple battles to earn his freedom from slavery and then join with Princess Faustina in order to defeat numerous enemies and restore peace to the land.",

      "description": "<i>Revolution</i> is a turn-based strategy game about development and territorial expansion, with sixteen distinct civilizations from prehistoric times to the future. Not counting Silent Service, it is the second console-only Sid Meier branded game, the first being Sid Meier's C.P.U. Bach, and it is the first in the Civilization sub series to be released on console platforms.\n\nSpecifically built up with console controls in mind, the original gameplay is intact but with stripped-down complexity. The available civilizations include America, England, Japan, Aztec, China, India, Mongolia, Rome, Egypt, France, Arabia, Greece, Spain, Germany, Zulu and Russia, each with their own leaders (e.g. Julius Caesar, Abraham Lincoln) and specific perks. Another civilization, the Barbarians, is not playable and they constantly wage war with the other ones. Gameplay sessions are generally shorter with fewer victory conditions and simplified city management. The possible strategies are still very open, as the four victory conditions are Domination, Technology, Economic and Cultural. Players can either build vast armies and try to dominate the other civilizations to capture their cities (Domination), or use a more subtle, diplomatic approach to gain the upper hand. There is a technology tree to eventually move into space and be the first to reach Alpha Centauri (Technology), players can try to create a World Back earn 20,000 gold (Economic), or build twenty wonders (Cultural).\n\nUnits are often specific for a certain civilization and gain experience, as well as through research, to access upgrades. That way, a catapult can eventually become a tank. The focus is as usual on micromanagement. The two single-player modes allow for straight matches against AI players or rather fixed scenarios to complete. Multiplayer is supported for up to four players, free-for-all or with teams.",

      "description": "<i>Zoids Assault</i> is the re-imagining of the Zoids universe based on the toy model franchise. It is a strategy game with RPG elements that features giant robots. The player takes charge of Maroll's 99th Zoid Platoon, Mace Squad, and leads a covert mission behind enemy lines into Jamil alongside Sgt. Jessica Lambert and the commando squad known as Katana. The zoids can be customized with parts claimed from defeated foes to build up a force that can get a stronger grip on the battlefield.\n\nSince story's setting places the player working behind enemy lines, he is constantly outgunned and outmanned at nearly every turn. The player controls a squad of five zoid pilots that have a different role in the squad. They need to be managed in terms of special skills, weapon/armor loadout, and can be customized with different color schemes.\n\nBecause of the long odds facing the mission, mastering cover fire, coordinated fire, and the EMP systems will be the key to leading Mace Squad to victory, with the aim to bring the shadows of a 10-year-old conflict to the light of day.",

      "description": "<i>Hail to the Chimp</i> is a political satire/party game in the vein of the Mario Party series.  In the \"Animal Kingdom\", the King Lion has disappeared after being implicated in a series of scandals and as a result, animals across the kingdom demand a new king by holding an election.  The election becomes a stalemate, leading the lowliest form of animals, Clams, with the deciding vote.  As a result, each candidate must compete in a free-for-all to get the Clam vote and become the new president.\n\nThe gameplay mostly consists of competing on themed party boards, such as ships, a volcano and a snowy tundra, collecting clams to score points and raise their overall vote count while avoiding obstacles and attacks from rival opponents.  The results of each contest are showed in a news-themed stats screen, showing overall stats presented by animal newscasters such as a turtle and a woodpecker named Woodchuck Chumley.  Players can also form alliances after certain stages and recruit rival candidates to help them in later stages, only later to turn against them as well.\n\nThere are ten animals to choose (a hippo, armadillo, polar bear, octopus, platypus, and the game's namesake chimp) in the multiplayer mode, which has four human opponents competing against each other, but in the single-player <b>\"Campaign\"</b> mode, the player competes in ten stages, each themed for a certain animal during the game, competing in a series events aimed towards that character that they are controlling. There are also four opponents during the <b>\"Campaign\"</b> mode, but instead has three CPU opponents in place of human opponents.",

Once again the player will hire and release players, along with assistant coaches and various office personnel as well as edit plays to be used by their team.\n\nGames are once again played out in real time, but the player has no control of their team, instead they coach their players, telling them what runs to play as well as make game breaking decisions such as going for the win on 4th and goal with only a few seconds on the clock or faking a field goal and going for two points to win rather than tie the game.  Players can also control their team in the offseason, tracking future players in the <i>NFL Draft</i>.\n\nPlayers can also go online and share their playbook for others to view as well as compete head-to-head, coaching their team against their opponents.",

A new alternate timeline appears where the Soviets now find themselves as the leading superpower but also discover something else has gone terribly wrong. World War III is raging, the Japanese Empire of the Rising Sun has risen in the east challenging the Soviet bid for world domination. A three-way war now emerges between the Soviet Union, the Allies, and a new Empire of the Rising Sun faction.\n\nThe game follows the tradition of the <i>Command & Conquer</i> series  where the player must build up bases and produce a massive attack force to destroy all enemies. The player may choose any one of the three factions, each with a different array of infantry, armored vehicles, aircraft, ships to fight with, as well as buildings with new technologies, upgrades, and the all-powerful superweapons. Players do all their building from a sidebar, this allows them to create production queues and deploy structures fast and easily.\n\nThe Xbox 360 version is almost identical but modified to the console's controls.

      "description": "In the alternative history of <i>Commanders: Attack of the Genos</i>, humanity has already in the early 1900's uncovered the secrets of the atom. The discovery of gene manipulation led to the creation of humans without faults that were stronger, faster and smarter. These new humans came to be called the Genos. Soon the normal humans decided to revolt, leading to genocide.  After a while a peace treaty is signed, but at the start of the game the human nations are strengthening their military. It's in this environment a young commander, Alec Falcon, is out training his troops, when he gets a distress call from a scientist. The Genos are attacking, and it's now up to the player to lead Alec and his troops into battle.\n\n<i>Commanders: Attack of the Genos</i> is a turn based tactical strategy game. The player has a number of units that he has to command to achieve each level's objectives. Each under unit has a certain number of points that are used for issuing different actions such as moving attacking and capturing buildings. Each level\u2019s terrain affects the units' movement and defence.  For example, units have less defence when standing on an open road or path, but can move farther each turn. To cross water and ridges, air units must be used.  Units can be either light or heavy.  Light units are cheap and can move farther, while heavy units are slow and expensive but have more firepower. There's also artillery units that can attack over long distances.  Air units can move over great distances and can only be attacked by anti-air units. Each unit has its own strengths and weaknesses and will therefore be more effective versus certain other units, while less versus others. \n\nEach player has a commander unit. Each commander has a special power that affects nearby units.  There are passive powers such as extra defence, extra damage and healing that are ongoing.  There are also active powers that require that the Active Power bar is full.  They can be used to damage, heal or freeze nearby units for one turn.\n\nBuildings can be captured by using infantry units. To produce units, the player has to build capitols, factories and airports. Throughout each level the player will find bonus tokens that can be picked up. These can have a positive effect such as extra health, money or experience, but they can also explode and thus cause damage.\n\nAfter each completed level, the player will get a score from one to five stars.  This rating is based on the number of rounds it has taken to complete the level, the number of enemy units that has been destroyed, and how much damage the player has been taken in comparison to how much he has given.",

It's only a matter of time until this tension unleashes itself in the last war mankind will ever fight: the EndWar.\n\n<i>Tom Clancy's EndWar</i> is a real-time strategy game without base construction and single unit control. Instead the player orders squads of gunships, tanks and such around while being able to order reinforcements after a certain amount of time has passed. It is however wise for the player to look after his squads as they gain experience during the course of the battle and advance in six ranks after a successful battle making them more and more powerful. It is even possible to upgrade the units in the four categories \"Attack\", \"Defense\", \"Mobility\" and \"Proficiency\" with credits earned at the end of each mission.\n\nWhat makes <i>Tom Clancy's EndWar</i> unique is the way how it is controlled. Instead of using a cursor, all actions are performed by voice command.\n\nEach squad and hostile as well as important points on the map have numbers and letters assigned to them and the player uses these in combination of a few keywords to issue an order. If the player e.g. wants to send his first squad of gunships to attack the second squad of enemy infantry he has to press and hold a button to activate voice recognition, say \"Unit 1 Attack Hostile 2\" (in the English version) and release the button. If the system understood the order it is then carried out. It is also possible to issue a series of orders by completing the first order without releasing the button. The system will then await the following orders to be spoken before activating them all upon the release of the button.\n\nTo make it easier for the player to know what he can say, an onscreen pop-up window opens up as the player progresses through the command chain showing all possible words that can  be used in the current context.\n\nDuring all this the camera always follows a squad. Freely moving around the battlefield is not possible. Instead the player jumps around with the command \"Unit Number Camera\" or activates the overview map called \"Sitrep\" which shows a abstract real-time map of the battlefield.\n\nThe single player campaign puts the player in control of all three armies while fighting battles all over the world against an unknown terrorist group. The game also features 1on1 and 2on2 skirmishes with bots, cooperative campaign play and a permanent online World War III-scenario in which thousands of players fight for world domination by joining one of the three factions and help conquering and defending points on the world map. These include air force bases which give access to air strikes and additional infantry units and capital cities that have to be conquered in three stages. Once a day a campaign-update rolls out which updates the map to reflect the territorial changes based on the battles fought in the last 24 hours.\n\nAs opposed to the the console-versions, the windows release also allows for control with mouse and keyboard, features an updated UI and camera and includes several new missions and multiplayer maps.

      "description": "After a thousand years of peace, the aliens have returned to invade once again. The only hope of stopping them is to activate the Defense Grid and drive them away, as was done before.\n\n<i>Defense Grid: The Awakening</i> is a tower defense game, in which you control the placement of various kinds of towers and defend against the invading aliens. The aliens come in waves, and as the game progresses the aliens become more powerful and more numerous. The game consists of a number of missions, each of which is to be completed in succession by defending the power cores from the aliens.\n\nThere are several types of towers, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, and each of which can be upgraded to increase its effectiveness. Placing and upgrading towers costs resources, which can be gained by destroying the aliens, or from interest on your current stock of resources. In addition to the towers, the player will acquire an orbital laser which can be fired, rarely, to destroy the aliens at its point of impact immediately, with the drawback that no resources will be gained from them.\n\nIf the player can complete the missions successfully, he will be awarded a medal (bronze, silver, or gold) for completing the mission, based on the number of cores that remain, as well as the number of points acquired. Completing missions unlocks later missions as well as alternate play modes for the mission completed, such as a challenge mode with more powerful aliens or a mode in which only a limited number of towers can be placed.",

      "description": "The best scientists of the world thought they had found the ultimate solution to Global Warming: Building an artificial force field around the planet to help the rapidly decreasing atmosphere and guarantee the survival of mankind. It took more than 22 years to build but in the end it was acclaimed all around the world as the one symbol for hope and the ultimate proof that mankind can do anything. Well at least until they found the flaw in their perfect plan: Nature's ability to adapt.\n\nOnly known as the Happening, storms began to appear all over the planet. Stronger than anything mankind had ever seen they brought destruction and death upon the world. Whole cities where destroyed in just a few days and no end in sight. With no way to escape, the building of gigantic underground cryogenic sleep caverns began. Of course these caverns could only hold a privileged few and the rest was damned to stay on the surface, some starving to death, others going mad or killing each other.\n\nBut not everyone died. Many adapted, using everything that was left from the storm and over the centuries transformed into the Sai, humans that are one with nature. Meanwhile, deep down under the surface, the Echelon awaken from their sleep with the goal to reclaim their old planet.\n\n<i>Stormrise</i> is a real-time strategy game without base building and a unique point of view. Similar to Tom Clancy's EndWar the camera always follows a squad. But instead of using voice commands to switch between everyone, a technology called \"Whip Select\" comes into play. Holding a specific button down brings up a beam. Moving the beam over the symbol of one of the squads and letting go then changes the camera position to that squad and then allowing the player to order that unit around with the help of the 3D-target cursor.\n\nInstead of building a base and producing units there, the player starts with a pre-defined group of units in single player lead by Echelon-Commander Geary and a warp gate in multiplayer. Both modes also feature control points that automatically collect energy once captured. This energy is needed to call in reinforcements, upgrade units or outfit the control point with turrets, shields and such in three stages. It is even possible to create a second warp gate at the control point allowing the player to call reinforcements in closer to the front line.\n\nEither at the start or after upgrading them, most of the nine available units on each side get access to alternate weapons like flame throwers and additional offensive and defensive tactics. The player can change the current load-out of a unit at any time with the help of a circular menu that shows up after a button press.",

      "description": "Based on the popular card game, <i>Lost Cities</i> for Xbox Live Arcade plays in much the same way. The standard one-on-one mode allows the player to face off against the AI or against another player over Xbox Live.\n\nEach player is dealt eight cards made up of five different colors numbered from 2 to 10.  The objective of the game is to place cards of the same color in sequential order on the corresponding colored expedition.  When the first card in an expedition is placed the player loses 20 points which is the cost of starting an expedition.  After the initial investment the player will gain the number of points on the card. There are also Investment cards which multiply the amount points that are earned per card played on an expedition but also multiplies the initial point loss. \n\nAfter placing a card another card is drawn so that the player always has 8 cards in his hand.  The goal is to score more points than your opponent by the time the remaining cards in the deck are drawn.  \n\nThere is also a two-on-two team mode which plays similarly except the players on the same team can pass cards to their teammate. The game supports the Vision Camera for the players' avatars.",

      "description": "On New Year's Eve 1958 Hyman Roth not only celebrated his birthday, he also celebrated the successful expansion of the Corleone family, successfully lead by Don Michael Corleone for fifteen years now, into Cuba. But the celebrations did not last long when suddenly \"la revolucion\" started and all hell breaks loose. Michael and Hyman manage to escape with most of the other family members but Aldo Trapani (the main protagonist in The Godfather) gets killed - just in time for five new families to threaten the Corleone family's control over New York, Florida and Las Vegas. As one of Aldo Trapani's closest soldiers, the player jumps into the role of Dominic to help Michael and the Corleone family win the war as well as to build a family of his now.\n\nLooking over Dominic's shoulder, the player moves freely through three cities depicting a New York, Florida and Cuba from the late '50s/early '60s traveling between them by airplane. Connected by the main storyline, the main goal of Dominic is to grow his family and destroy the other five families. This is done in two main steps: Taking over businesses and killing so-called \"Made Man\". Taking over a business is done the same way as in the predecessor: Enter the shop/joint/factory/construction site, fight through the enemy guards and find the person with the Godfather-sign over his head. That is the one the player needs to threaten until he gives up his resistance and pays his dues to Dominic from now on instead of the other family.\n\nEach business owner has his own weak spot as well as a breaking point. A weak spot ranges from destroying inventory to punching him or her in the face, and gives a 25% bonus on the monetary outcome. But if the player pressures the owner to much, he either dies from the torture or reaches his breaking point. Then he gets aggressive, cannot be intimidated anymore and attacks without mercy. Is the intimidation successful however, the player gets a one-time cash advance and gains money from the joint every day. In addition there are several rackets combined in a crime ring. Once the player controls it, he immediately gains a bonus until he loses one of the rackets in the crime ring. This goes for his enemy as well. When the player takes over a business of a crime ring, the bonuses like bullet-proof vests for all family members or brass knuckles for higher melee damage are instantly removed. That's why the enemy families do not just sit by and let Dominic take their businesses one by one. So the player has to hire guards to protect the businesses. In case of an attack, he can also send one of his soldiers to help in the defense.\n\nThis soldier or so-called \"Made Man\", is initially discovered and invited by the player to join his family while hanging out at the various safe houses and rackets. Each of them has a specialization. While one might be good at planting bombs, the other is a safe cracker very useful to rob banks and loot all the various safes in the city to get an achievement. As the player progresses through the game, he cannot only hire more family members, but can also promote a few of his soldiers. This allows them to learn a second and even third profession on top of their initial one. It is also possible to upgrade certain skills like Survival (stay longer conscious once out of health) of a family member, in return for hard-earned cash. When a made man is downed by enemy fire, he does not immediately get transferred to the next hospital or police station. Instead there is a time window in which everyone can revive the other with a shot of adrenaline. If it's too late, the player respawns at the hospital/police station and loses some money while his made man is out of the picture for a certain amount of time. This is also true for the player if he has a medic on his team, otherwise he goes directly to jail or the hospital.\n\nThe amount of time it takes them to get back on your side can be reduced by using favors. Favors are handed out by random people with a sign over their head on the streets and by high-ranking officials. Both give the player a mission which can involve killing or beating someone up, blowing a business (even one of the player's) to hell or something similar. The difference is, that the favor of an official can be saved for later like immediately rebuilding a bombed business. Favors of random people instead come in the form of money rewards or kill conditions.\n\nKill conditions are needed to get an enemy made man. Just shooting them only puts them in the hospital. To take them permanently out the picture, the player needs to make an example of the man by fulfilling the kill condition. Shoving a made man from the roof of a building, putting a bullet between his eyes and such are examples for such kill conditions. Once all made men of a family have been eliminated forever, the player can deal the final blow to the rival family: killing their Don and blowing up their compound. All while dealing with the police that hunts you down just for forgetting to silence a witness of a crime.\n\nThe game also features a multiplayer mode that ties in with the single player campaign. Upon entering the multiplayer mode, the player chooses one of his family members he has hired in single-player and takes on his role. During his participation in the four game modes Team Deathmatch, Demolition Assault (blow up three objects in enemy territory), FireStarter (torch barrels, gas and propane tanks to rack up scoring multiplicators), Safecracker (bust a safe and hold the position for more points), the player then earns honor points for his family member. These are used in single player to buy a new weapon license for that soldier, which allows him to use the higher level weapons the player finds scattered around the city and can be handed to him.",

      "description": "<i>Plants vs. Zombies</i> belongs to the \"tower defense\" sub-genre of casual games, where the objective is to deploy a series of stationary weapons to protect a structure against hordes of enemies. Plants provide the artillery, and can be bought with sun power, the game's currency. The enemies are zombies invading a suburban lawn. At the start of each level, the player starts to plant the available seeds on the lawn in a strategic manner. Zombies slowly begin to appear from the street at the right side, just a few initially, and must be destroyed before they can reach the house on the other side. Sun power icons falls from the sky randomly, and must be collected with the mouse to increase the funds. The sunflower can be planted to generate extra units of sun power, but doesn't have any attack power against the invading undead. Besides their cost, the seed packs take some time to recharge after being used.\n\nThere are several types of offensive plants available. Pea shooters are the basic variety, spitting a projectile forwards every few seconds. Variations appear later in the game, shooting several peas at the same time and freezing the enemies, making them move slower. The carnivorous plant gobbles up a zombie when he gets near its gaping mouth, but takes some time to do so, becoming ineffective while busy digesting the corpse. The cherry bomb explodes after being deployed, carbonizing any of the undead surrounding its landing spot. The potato mine is half-buried with a sensor sticking from the top, and detonates when one of the walking dead steps on it. Plants can be removed with the shovel to make space for new ones.\n\nMini-games appear from time to time. There are twenty of them, and most are parodies of well-known casual titles: ZomBotany (1 and 2), Wall-nut Bowling (1 and 2), Slot Machine, It's Raining Seeds, Beghouled, Invisi-ghoul, Seeing Stars, Zombiquarium, Beghouled Twist, Big Trouble Little Zombie, Portal Combat, Column Like You See 'Em, Bobsled Bonanza, Zombie Nimble Zombie Quick, Whack a Zombie, Last Stand, Pogo Party, and Dr. Zomboss's Revenge. After being played once, they become available directly from the main menu.\n\nThe game has three gameplay modes. In the main adventure mode, levels get progressively more difficult, and at the end of each one the player receives a new plant for the arsenal. Puzzle mode has two variations: \"Vasebreaker\", where the goal is to break the vases scattered on the lawn, to uncover plants or zombies and use the former to fight the latter, and \"I, Zombie\", where the player controls the zombies against the plants. In survival mode, the zombies attack in turns. After each turn, the player can choose plants from the arsenal. There are three types of survival: normal (one wave per turn, 5 turns) on each of the five maps, hard (two waves per turn, 5 turns) on each of the five maps, and endless (two waves per turn, endless amount of turns) on the pool map.\n\nThe Zen Garden stores all the available plants, where they have to be tended, watered, fertilized, sprayed for bugs and listen to music. When they are happy, they drop coins that can be used to buy more plants and other garden additions.",

      "description": "Koei brings us again a new addition to the Dynasty Warriors series. This installment still features the same storyline based on the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, with the various officers as playable characters. The character list and appearance is the same as in Dynasty Warriors 6, meaning some of the previous game's characters are not available.\n\nThe difference in this one is that the player is allowed to choose only one character for the chosen force (either Wei, Wu or Shu) who starts in a village that will act as the hub, or camp, from which the game battles are accessed. By completing story missions, some characters are added and can be played as without starting a new game, meaning all acquired weapons, items and materials will be kept.\n\nThe chosen character can be customized in various ways. Apart from the main weapon, one sub weapon, chosen from many weapon types, can be equipped. Both weapons can be switched anytime during battle, to accommodate the situation. A new addition is the Chi system which allows to set special abilities to the character, there are four slots to equip Chi (the two arms and legs). Weapons can also be customized by adding Orbs that give different abilities, such as elemental properties.\n\nIn the village, the player can exchange materials, buy weaponry, items for use in battle, Chi skills and Orbs. Some NPC's may appear in the village, some giving materials or items, or Officer cards, which can be set to help the Village's growth. Over time, better items can be acquired from the shops.\n\nBy talking to the quest board or the Guard at the village's gate, main Missions or Requests can be chosen. Each battle is a series of small maps where various enemy soldiers and weaponry are fought, eventually leading to the commander of the enemy army. The goal of each battle can vary, some are classic goals like \"Defeat the Commander\" and some, less battle oriented, like \"Retrieve all treasure boxes\". In addition, there also are bonus missions that require the player to defeat a particular unit, reaching a certain point before a certain time, etc. Each bonus mission gives extra experience points upon completion.\n\nOther new additions to the battle system are the possibility to have aerial battles, and the main feature of the game: the Fury Mode, unleashed when the Fury gauge (replacing the traditional Musou gauge) is full. The furied character has better stats and move sets, and can unleash the infamous Musou attack to deal some extra damage.\n\nTo add to the surreal look of the game, some new bosses are actually massive beast-like weapons, and usually require the help of other players to defeat them. Multiplayer mode is available only via AdHoc connection, and can connect up to four players.\n",

      "description": "<i>Blood Bowl</i> is an official video game adaptation of the table-top game of the same name but is not a remake of the first Blood Bowl. Instead the game is the in-official successor to Chaos League: Sudden Death and builds upon its features.\n\nBased on the Living Rulebook 5.0 ruleset, <i>Blood Bowl</i> is a dark fantasy version of American Football with 11 players per team beating each other to death in order to get a touchdown. The game features eighth races with different strength and weaknesses including the fast but weak Goblins, the flexible but mediocre Humans and the powerful but slow Orcs. The player can either play fast games with pre-defined teams or enter the heart of the game: the campaign. In the campaign the player creates a new team from scratch trying to bring it up to the top of the ranking of the current Blood Bowl-season. To accomplish this goal the player has to buy players with different attributes and skills, close sponsor contracts to earn additional money and decide how to influence the upcoming game by bribing the referee, buying potions for his team and other illegal activities. His players also gain experience points during a match especially for scoring touchdowns or by downing enemy players. Once they gain a level up, they can learn an additional skill like blocking.\n\nOnce the team stands, the game begins with the option to play either in real-time- or turn-based-mode. The turn-based-mode is very close to the table-top game with 8 rounds per half-time, turnover-events and manual dice rolls. Although the real-time-mode also features dice rolls, they are done behind the players backs and the outcome of each action is determined by one or more skill checks. The game grid is also still divided into squares but these are invisible now. The most important difference is that in real-time-mode the player can give orders to more than one player at all times and other elements like turnover-events are removed. If the player still needs time to think about his moves, he can activate the concentration mode which pauses the game and allows him to give orders without pressure.\n\nThe game features several multiplayer-modes including hot seat in which two players can play on one machine in turn-based-mode against each other and worldwide open and private online-leagues for which the players are able to create up to 32 teams.",

As in the original card game, the player casts magic spells to summon various creatures, add enchantments to them, and cause various other effects, and attacks the other players to destroy them. The game is meant to be easy for new <i>M:tG</i> players to pick up, while not disappointing experienced players. Some of the game mechanics, such as tapping lands, is done automatically, and there's no deck construction - only unlocking cards and pre-built decks.\n\nThe game has two campaigns, for single-player and two-player co-operative play. In online play, in addition to classic two-player duels, the game supports two-player co-operative play and free-for-all play, up to 4 players. Online play also has ranked play modes and a leaderboard. The game also has various puzzle challenges to solve.",

Now caught in the middle of civil warfare, their only choice is to fight it out and stay alive as long as possible. \n\n<i>Raven Squad</i> is your standard tactical real time strategy game with a twist. You can control your squad members in first person view as well. The RTS section contains no base building as you'll be given a set number of units for each level to complete. It plays very much like Ground Control and Desert Rats vs. Afrika Korps. The first person mode plays pretty much like any first person shooter in the market, giving you the advantage to perform one shot kills (eg. head-shots). The game features single player co-op as well.\n\n",

      "description": "With <i>Tropico 3</i> the series returns to its roots, playing once again during the time-period 1950-2000. Being more of a remake, than a real successor, the game once again gives the player full control over a banana republic in the Caribbean. To successfully live through his term in office, El Presidente needs to build a booming economy and keep his inhabitants happy as well as the USA and USSR.\n\nMost of the city is built by the player himself including apartment buildings and streets. While some buildings need space to do their job (like farms), others need a road-connection or don't function without electricity. The only buildings that pop up automatically are homes of poor people. To build up his city, the player of course needs money. Money is earned several different ways. Every year the player gets foreign aid from the superpowers. Several times a year a tanker comes by and transports away export goods like oil (the new resource in <i>Tropico 3</i>) or bananas, also bringing money in. Another way to earn money is to make the island tourist friendly and rip them off while they are visiting. The least of the players income comes from his own people who pay lease, use the available entertainment program and such. How much everything costs is determined by the player. He is also responsible for employing from overseas, if the required expertise isn't yet available on his island which on the other hand enrages the Nationalists on the island. The Nationalists are one of the many groups of people the player needs to make happy besides each individual themselves.\n\nIn addition each citizen is his or her own entity, with their own names, relationships to other citizens, wants and desires. Some feel the need to excel in studies, others seek religious enlightenment, some just want to have a good time. They even take political affiliations and work towards those ends. The citizens do not blindly follow orders, they must be persuaded through meeting their desires, or just pure greed or terror meaning bribing them or putting out a contract on them. The latter is especially useful to keep the rebels at bay but if all fails and the rebels attack, the player's army as well as himself engage in an automatic battle until only one side stands. The game ends if the palace is blown up, the player doesn't get re-elected or the USA/USSR decide that El Presidente has become a pain in the butt. In addition the missions in the campaign feature objectives like have 150 tourists visit the island.\n\nBesides the new 3D-engine, the biggest change in comparison to Tropico is the inclusion of a 3D-Avatar of the player inside the game. Generated at the beginning from scratch or by using one of the pre-existing characters like Fidel Castro, the avatar can be sent around the island, visiting production facilities or construction sites to temporarily increase the production and building speed. The avatar can also be send to the palace where he holds a speech and increases the freedom of the listing inhabitants.\n\nThe game features an editor that doesn't allow the player to create a new island, those are pre-defined or random generated, but instead allows him to build a new challenge with its own goals, events and difficulty-settings. These challenges can then be uploaded onto the <i>Tropico 3</i>-server and everyone can try and beat the current highscore on that map. No other multiplayer-mode is available.\n\nThe Steam edition contains some additional content:\n<ul>\n<li>Two additional maps for the sandbox mode.</li> \n<li>Two additional costumes for the el presidente avatar editor.</li>\n<li>Two additional accessories for the el presidente avatar editor.</li>\n</ul>",

      "description": "<i>Panzer General: Allied Assault</i> is a turn-based card/boardgame mix inspired by the Panzer General series. The map is divided into 5*6 squares with the first row on each side being the home row for the respective party. Each tile has different attributes and is more or less important. While a river gives -3 to the attack bonus, attacking while sitting behind a mountain grants +3 defense. Each tile also grants a specific amount of prestige points at the end of each round for the army who previously conquered it by placing a unit on it.\n\nPrestige points are needed to buy additional cards at the beginning of a round as well as for placing new units like tanks or infantry on the map. Each player can normally only have up to 10 cards in his deck. Cards represent everything in the game from units over actions like ordering a bomb-strike on enemy artillery, to attacks. They can be played out as long as enough prestige points are available. In addition each placed unit can either move one tile each round or attack an enemy. This rule can only be bypassed by playing a Free Attack Action card.\n\nCombat itself is divided into several stages. First the game looks if an enemy is dug in and gives him the first shot if that is the case. Then the defense and attack points are calculated based on factors like terrain cover, dug-in conditions and support from friendly units on nearby tiles or artillery in range. Afterwards combat cards are played until both players choose to pass. Combat cards allow for example to take out the artillery support via an air strike or just add -3 to the defense rating of the enemy in order to overcome his defense rating. Once both player pass, they can sacrifice a battle card from their available deck to add its worth to either their defense or offense rating as the last means to change the final outcome. To add a little bit of luck to the game, a dice roll follows. Whatever is rolled will be added to the attackers' attack points making him either stronger or weaker. For example: the dice lands on a -3. After the dice fell, the game plays out the combat, dealing out damage as determined by the defense and attack points of each party and then the positions change. The attacker becomes defender and the inital defender is now the attacker. If after the second round one unit still isn't either dead or retreating, the outcome is a draw. Otherwise the winning party gains an additional health point and can choose to advance onto the enemy position if the initial attackers won.\n\nThe game features a campaign with twelve normal and three bonus missions. Successfully completing them inside a set round limit unlocks more or less new cards which are only available in multiplayer. Getting an achievement also grants a new card that can then be used to make custom decks for both the Germans and Americans with the integrated deck builder.",

There Eddie must fight his way through the hordes of the demon Emperor Doviculus to free humanity.\n\n<i>Br\u00fctal Legend</i> is set in a free-roaming world inspired by heavy metal album covers, with the primary mode of transportation around the world being Eddie's car \"The Deuce\" (AKA \"The Druid Plow\"). Combat is mostly basic hack-and-slash, alternatively attacking with either Eddie's axe or his guitar Clementine. Through Eddie's guitar the power of rock can summon his car, melt enemy's faces, and even raise ancient structures left behind by the Titans. Many of the main missions, and the multiplayer mode, add real-time strategy elements to the mix. During these missions there are fan-geysers on the battlefield that can be harvested by summoning merchandise booths. Fans are spent to create units that can be commanded and even double-teamed with for devastating results. The ultimate goal of most of these missions is to destroy the enemy's stage before they destroy yours.\n\nUpgrades can be purchased for Eddie's combat abilities and his car from The Guardian of Metal at the center of the Earth. The upgrades come in exchange for Fire Tributes that are collected by completing main and side missions, and finding the various collectibles around the landscape.",

      "description": "Although <i>James Cameron's Avatar: The Game</i> is named after the movie, the story itself doesn't follow the plot of the film. Instead the player takes on the role of Lance Corporal Ryder, a signal-specialist who is send to the distant moon Pandora. But Ryder isn't just any other soldier. Instead he or she is one of the selected group of people that take part in the so-called Avatar-program. Avatars are a hybrid of Na'vi DNA and human DNA that have been created in order to better interact with the inhabitants of the planet: the Na'vi, tribe-like and technology-wise not very advanced people that are one with nature. Although the Na'vi are friendly to the new-comers at first, soon the humans want more than just diplomatic relations. They want to relocate the Na'vi in order to be able to strip the planet of its natural resources. A war breaks out which only one side can win - it is up to the player which it will be.\n\nEarly in the game the player has to decide weather he wants to help the Na'vi unlock the power of the Well of Souls or if he wants to stay with the humans. Depending on his choice, the gameplay changes significantly:\n<ul><li><b>Human</b>: As a human the player can enter buildings, drive vehicles like buggies and helicopters and use full-body armor as well as several different kinds of firearms including shotguns and flamethrowers. In addition Pandora itself is against him meaning both plants and animals will attack the player but will also grant experience points. As a human the player can build pods that replenish ammo and health a specific locations.\n\n<li><b>Na'vi</b>: The Na'vi are more than two meters high and as such can neither enter buildings nor use humans vehicles. But Pandora herself is friendly so plants and animals won't attack (or give experience points for that matter) allowing the player to ride strange horses or fly around on huge dinosaur-like creatures. While the player himself is able to use a machine gun, normally the Na'vi rely on bows and arrows as well as strange swords and staves. If the player manages to pull of a five-hit-combo, a special attack comes available. Na'vi harvest plants in order to get arrows and cell samples.</li></ul>\nBoth characters have in common, that they are controlled in a standard 3rd-person-shooter-fashion and have to collect DNA/cell samples. Once enough have been collected, the player gains the ability to get right back into the fight after his hit-points reach zero. Only if not enough samples have been collected will the player re-spawn at the nearest outpost. Also both parties earn experience points for completing quests and killing enemies. Once enough points have been collected, the character levels up and get's access to new weapons and spells allowing him to make himself invisible for example.\n\nPandora is divided into several sectors and each sector features several challenges like lifting 100% of the fog of war or collecting a certain amount of cell samples. Fulfilling these objectives grants additional experience points. To further help the player in his quest, a world-domination-mini-game is available at each transporter. This mini-game is turn-based and has the player starting out with only one sector and the goal of conquering all the other. Doing so will grant his character additional experience points, increase his weapons strength and such. Money for building bases and ordering troops on the other hand is earned by playing through the normal campaign. To conquer enemy sectors, three types of units are available that can only be build at a base. Combat is a simple numbers game and plays out automatically. To defend conquered sectors, a defense building for each type of unit can be build.\n\nThe game offers five team-based multiplayer-modes: King of the Hill, Capture the Flag, Team Deathmatch, Capture and Hold (capture control points in order to make the enemies team loose victory points) and Final Fight where the RDA has to protect three missiles in their base while the Na'vi have to destroy them.",

      "description": "<i>Supreme Commander 2</i> takes place 25 years after the events of Supreme Commander. The three opposing sides - the Cybran Nation, the Illuminates and the United Earth Federation - are still fighting in the Infinite War all across the galaxy, spreading chaos and unrest with the player right in the middle as the Supreme Commander.\n\nAs opposed to the first game, there's only one single player campaign during which the player will take over the control over the armies of each of the factions starting with the UEF-campaign as Commander Dominic \"Migraine\" Maddox followed by Commander Thalia Kael in the Illuminates-campaign and finally as Commander Ivan Brackman in the Cybran-campaign. But the game still is a real-time-strategy game in the vain of Total Annihilation featuring an insane amount of units on the huge battlefields at the same time. To keep track of everything, the player can seamlessly zoom out to a strategic map or zoom in until he's up close with his avatar, the mighty ACU. The ACU can construct buildings faster than the normal engineer and has access to powerful weapons in order to fight his enemies. But once the ACU has been destroyed, the mission or the multiplayer-match is lost.\n\nAlso different from the first game is the completely overhauled resource-management. This time around the player has to have the resources needed to build a unit or structure available upon giving the order instead of loosing them over time while the building is in progress. The resources themselves on the other hand haven't changed with mass and energy being needed to support the war-effort.\n\nEach structure the player builds can now be upgraded with add-ons e.g. putting a shield around them in order to increase their defensive-abilities. In addition five tech-trees are available to unlock upgrades for the three types of units as well as buildings and the ACU which are also visible on the battlefield with a shimmering aura around units which have received the shield upgrade for example. The points needed for such a research are collected automatically although the rate at which they are earned can be increased by building a research-facility. Research will ultimately also give the players access to atomic weapons as well as powerful prototype structures and units including the UEF Flying Fortress or the Cybranasaurus Rex, a genetically modified reptile that has become the ultimate machine of destruction.\n\nBesides the main campaign, the game features a skirmish-mode against the AI with three different victory conditions: only the destruction of the enemies ACU is needed, everything has to be destroyed or the Infinite War which features no victory conditions whatsoever. These conditions are also available in the multiplayer-mode for up to eight players.",

The Xbox 360 version features the possibility to import the Xbox avatar who walks around the game field as giant worker- since this obviously doesn't work on the PC there are seven pre-defined characters to choose from.",

Team rules can also be set, placing two players cooperatively against the other two at the table.\n\nAs with the other Hardwood titles, players can use animated \"Fooms\" to convey emotions to other players, such as luck, anger, or playfulness (throwing snowballs).  A variety of different backgrounds can be selected, and some background themes come with optional ambient effects (like beach sounds).  The presentation also has a bit of glitz, with sparkles coming off each Heart card played, or an ominous theme when the Queen of Spades is thrown down.\n\nAfter the New Xbox Experience, <i>Hardwood Hearts</i> was updated to include Xbox Avatar support.

      "description": "<i>Darwinia+</i> is a tweaked Xbox Live Arcade release of both Darwinia and Multiwinia.  The game takes place entirely inside a computer simulation, and features retro-styled graphics reminiscent of the film <i>Tron</i>. Similar to Lemmings, the player must use different unit types and assignable skills to create the non-controllable stick-man population (Darwinians) and guide them to safety. Standing in the way are a series of natural barriers, hazards, and the minions of a computer virus rampaging through the server. Leave shards of the virus alive, and it will reinfect areas of the server you've already cleared.\n\nThe single-player campaign takes place across 10 levels, with an additional 49 maps for multiplayer.  Single player primarily involves puzzle-solving and completing specific objectives.  Multiplayer puts the players in command of opposing Darwinian armies in a versus mode, similar to a traditional RTS.  Armies spawn steadily from captured spawn points, and must complete goals like King of the Hill and Capture the Flag.  Unlike the single player game, the player can select groups of Darwinians and order them around.  They will attack nearby enemies or capture nearby points. Further control can be gained by promoting officers to organize troops into formations, or by capturing crates which bestow buffs or single-use attacks (like airstrikes).\n\nDifferences from the original <i>Darwinia</i> primarily deal with control schemes. In this version, the player directly controls combat units, and directs their fire with the right stick.  A cursor is controlled with the left stick and selections made with the right stick. A.I. completes default tasks for units left to their own devices. A tutorial has also been added, guiding players through the initial stages of the workings of Darwinia.",

      "description": "<i>Toy Soldiers</i> is a tower defense game set inside miniature battlefields fielded by \"living\" WWI tin soldiers. The player controls packs of antique armies (German and British) created by the fictional Signal Toy Company of Bothell, WA in an attempt to prevent waves of enemies from raiding their defended toy box. There are 24 single player missions, and a multiplayer versus mode playable locally or online.\n\nIn single player, players earn money by destroying charging enemy units (from standard infantry to wheeled guns, and even enormous Tsar tanks). This money is then used to build new defenses on specific build pads, or to upgrade existing ones. As the match progresses, the number and type of enemies increase significantly. The hardest difficulty mode even removes A.I. control of the defenses, and requires the player to switch through and fire every one manually.\n\nDefenses include barbed wire that slows down infantry, machine guns, mortars, artillery, and even poison gas turrets. At any time, the player may control any of these defenses personally, aiming and firing with increased accuracy and judgement as to which charging unit possesses the greatest threat.  Certain units also grant new behavior when under player control, such as the ability to manually guide mortar shells.  Players can also fly airplanes to engage enemy air forces, or take control of a sniper tower to pick off infantry from afar.\n\nIn versus mode, players must still build and maintain defenses to protect their toy box, but must also spend their funds on units to attack their opponent. Players select their next wave of units with the Y button, but cannot directly control their assault like they can with their defense towers.\n",

      "description": "<i>Texas Cheat 'em</i> is a variant of the poker staple Texas Hold 'em, where, as the title suggests, players are allowed (and even encouraged) to cheat.\n\nThe underlying game follows all the rules of Hold 'em, and plays like a standard digital replication. Each round, players are awarded an amount of cheat points, which can then be spent on 15 tricks such as X-ray Vision (see another player's hidden cards), Card Suggestion (where you change one of your cards to another), or even something as blatant as stealing chips from another player.\n\nTo succeed at the cheat, the player must win a brief casino-themed mini-game, such as stopping a slot machine or roulette wheel at a specific target. For cheats where one player is directly affecting or attacking another (like stealing chips), the mini-game involves both players, such as rapidly tapping a button to make their horse cross the finish line first. If the player wins at the mini-game, the cheat is performed. If the player loses, the points are spent and nothing happens.\n\nPlayers can play alone against the A.I., or online with up to eight players at a table. The player can use their Xbox Avatar to represent them in-game, or select from a variety of character portraits.",

Players use coins dropped by defeated enemies to construct and upgrade new automated defenses along a linear path. In typical <i>South Park</i> style, towers include homemade fireworks launchers and barbecue grill lasers that bloodily dismember enemies such as cows, Ginger kids, hippies, and Mongolians.\n\nAside from the towers, each of the four boys can be placed and controlled. They can throw snowballs as a source of extra attack power, collect dropped coins used to purchase towers and upgrades, and trigger a special power unique to each character. These powers range from restoring some of the defended object's health, to clearing the screen of enemies with a fire attack. In single-player, the player switches between each of the four boys, positioning them or taking control as needed.  In multiplayer, each player is assigned a character they stick with for that level.\n\nThere are 11 levels structured like an episode of the show. Animated stills voiced by the show's actors set up each level; explaining the objective to be defended, and furthering the boys' search for the mastermind behind the attacks. Players can unlock 12 additional playable characters (with unique special abilities) through playing, as well as video clips from the show in a \"scrapbook\" viewable from the main menu.",

Players take turns controlling one worm at a time, and can either position the worm until time runs out, or use one weapon from a selectable menu.  Direct fire weapons (shotguns, Uzis) are used by the worm that selected it against whatever's nearby.  Thrown weapons (grenades, bazookas) are aimed by the player and affected by ever-changing wind.  Explosive weapons (airstrikes, bombs) blow holes in the terrain and drop any nearby worms into the new craters.\n\nMost weapons have a limited number of uses per map.  Each individual worm on the team has their own health meter, and will die when it reaches zero or they are knocked off the terrain and into the water.  The team that loses all its worms loses the match.\n\nPlayers can compete against the single-player A.I., or against each other online or off.  Multiplayer features different game types (deathmatch, forts, and races), with leaderboards for each.  Players also unlock customization options as they play through the single-player campaign, allowing them to create new teams with custom names, hats,  voices, and attitudes.",

The story acts as a prequel to the original Vandal Hearts.\n\nThe series' trademark isometric combat returns, now presented in 3-D with 3-D character models.  Players attempt to position themselves tactically to gain an advantage over stronger (or more numerous) foes.  Combat takes place in turns, with each side moving one character per turn.  Each party member can carry two weapons and switch between them without using up a \"turn,\" allowing them to shift quickly from a sword to a long-range bow, for example. Characters gain levels through successful battles, and increase skills with a particular weapon or spell  by using that weapon or spell in combat.\n\nMany engagements expand beyond simple combat by introducing some sort of puzzle element, ranging from pushing boulders to protecting characters from attackers. Missions may also radically update their goals as progress is made.  In addition to the standard game, there are also multiple endings and multiple \"secret maps\" unlocked across the regular levels.",

The winner of a trick is determined by the value of the highest card played, with spade cards trumping the value of cards of other suits. Rule variants are available when setting up a new game, including Cutthroat, Suicide and Mirrors.

Playing each of the minigames grant star ratings per game.  Stars unlock progressively-difficult tournaments.

The games uses a semi-circular play area ringed by 15 stones (numbered 3 to 18).  Each dice roll is totaled up, and the corresponding stone is removed.  If that stone has already been removed, one adjacent to it is removed.  The shooter is retired if they roll a \"keystone\" total - 3, 10, 11, or 18.  Players make bets on the outcome of rolls, with higher payoffs for uncommon results.

A few themed variants are available, with differing artwork and slight changes in rules.\n\n<b>Fortune's Tower</b> is a card game based on chance.  Each player is dealt one card down and two cards up. The facing cards are added together as a total. The player can choose to continue and deal up to eight additional rows, with each row adding to the total score, or to quit at any row and take their accumulated score up to that point.  If a card is dealt atop a card of the same value on the previous row, the game is over (though a few special conditions can prevent this and keep the game going).",

      "description": "<i>Flotilla</i> is a strategy game mixing combat and exploration in space. The premise is simple: the player has only seven months left to live and with nothing to lose he begins his last adventure. This adventure allows the player to explore the galaxy and build and customize his own space ship fleet. The game universe is randomized for every playthrough. The universe consists of numerous planets and the player moves between them one at a time. Each planet consists of an event which can be anything from helping cats running from the authorities to baby yetis chewing on the ship's electrical conduits. Often the player needs to make a choice (like helping a character or not) and these choices will then influence upcoming events. \n\nAt the start of the adventure the player has two small ships but as progress is made the fleet might grow and it is also possible for the player to customize his fleet. The player can get ship upgrades either from an event or from being victorious in battle. \n\nSome events lead to combat with other fleets of the galaxy. The battles of Flotilla are simultaneous turn-based, meaning that the player moves at the same time as his enemy. The combat consists of two phases: the orders phase and the action phase. In the order phase the player gives orders to each of his ships. Three different orders are available: the attack move which allows the ship to move and fire at the same time, the flank move which allows the ship to move to a better position without firing, and the focus fire which allows the ship to fire with an increased fire rate but only at a short move distance. \n\nOnce an order is selected, it's executed in four steps. First the player selects the horizontal movement and after that the vertical. The player also has to choose in what angle the ship should face and which enemy ship should be the primary target. For more advanced gameplay, the player can choose to turn on the manual mode which allows him to control how the ships will yaw, pitch and roll.\n\nAfter all ships have got their orders, the player ends the turn and the action phase is launched. Here the player can only watch as the ships carry out their orders. There's no interactivity in the action phase (besides camera movement) so there's no way back once an order has been assigned. \n\nShips have heavy armour which is able to deflect most projectiles. However each ship has two weak spots, the rear and the bottom. Therefore flanking is a very important tactic since it allows the player to hit the rear side of the enemy ships. The vertical movement is also important since it allows the player to attack from below. The ships gain combat experience for each battle and this leads to the ship's veterancy level increasing. A ship with high veterancy is more effective in combat since it does more damage and has better armour performance. \n\nIn addition to the adventure mode described above, the game also has a skirmish mode which allows the player to jump straight into battle. The skirmish mode can be played both against another player or against the AI. In the skirmish mode it is possible to choose from any ship available in the game.",

Why, protect her, of course! <i>Protect Me Knight</i> is a retro-style defense action game for up to four players where the objective is to, of course, protect the princess.\n\nChoosing from one of four character classes (fighter, ninja, amazon, or mage), the player must defeat waves of enemies as they try to reach the princess at the center of the screen. On each stage there are several barricades that enemies must destroy in order to pass, and players can build new barricades or upgrade and repair existing ones. Upgrade a barricade enough, and it will become a catapult that can be used to throw boulders at enemies. At the end of each stage a boss wave occurs, often with a much larger and more powerful enemy.\n\nAs players defeat enemies, they earn \"Love Points\" which can be spent either during the stage to build or upgrade barricades, or between stages to upgrade their character's abilities, including attack and defense as well as \"Killer Move\" abilities. The different character classes each have their own unique \"Killer Move\" and upgrades, and each player can even pick the color of their character. There is also a music mode where the authentic retro soundtrack can be freely listened to.",

The game is set on a single screen 2D battlefield where different tanks are positioned among valleys and mountains, shown from a side view. Players need to move their tanks left and right and target the other tanks by estimating the ballistics of the projectiles, based on shot angle and shot power. The game is played in real-time so it's possible to make consecutive shots with missiles, shells and nukes. Up close it is also possible to fire with a machine gun and health is shown as a small bar above the vehicles.\n\nExtra items allow the tank to fly with jump jets, use super fuel to improve speed, activate a shield, make the tank explode when it is destroyed, and activate AI-precise targeting. Airplanes drop packages and some are buried in the landscape. Additional weapons that can be picked up are lasers, crazy rockets, plasma streams, plasma balls and delay bombs (sticky bombs).\n\nThe game consists of a basic and an advanced combat campaign, each with twenty rounds. Points earned while playing can be spent on twelve different upgrades. Multiplayer is supported to four players locally and eight players online.",

Completing every level eventually makes 24 characters available, with only aesthetic differences and no influence on the gameplay.\n\nGameplay is based around balancing a baby Shrek snack in the form of a ball in levels usually in the form of a tower. There is a character positioned on either side of the screen, with in between a beam where the snack rolls, like guiding a marble on a see-saw or a labyrinth tilt-and-roll game. Each analogue stick controls a character, left and right, as they contort a crank to raise and lower the beam to collect coins, extra snacks, and extra lives. They also have to dodge windows, and purple vortexes (some of them moving about) that suck the snack inside and require to restart the level. By varying how the sticks are moved, the angle of the beam changes. To complete a level, a number of snacks needs to be fed to Baby Shrek without losing too many along the way. Some levels have a little variation where Baby Shrek for instance licks the ball, making it more sticky and easier to control.\n\nThere are 16 levels in total, based on 4 environments from the films such as The Swamp or Evil Queen's Castle. Multiplayer is supported locally, for two players, in a cooperative or a versus mode. In versus the screen is split vertically and introduces power-ups to steal the opponent's multiplier or have his beam disappear for a short while. The goal is to be the first to reach the ogre baby at the top.",

The game is hosted by Hasbro's toy figure Mr. Potato Head.\n\nThe includes games are:<ul>\n<li>Battleship</li>\n<li>Boggle</li>\n<li>Connect 4</li>\n<li>Scrabble (North American versions only, PS3 (PSN) and Xbox 360 retail + XBLA)</li>\n<li>Sorry!</li>\n<li>Sorry! Sliders</li>\n<li>Yahtzee</li></ul>There is no retail PS3 release. On the Xbox 360 it was also released on XBLA next to a retail version. There it was made available as a free application where users can buy the individual games to be played through the <i>Hasbro Family Game Night</i> hub, similar to <i>Game Room</i>. Not all games were released simultaneously on XBLA and three additional titles are available for that platform:<ul>\n<li>Connect 4x4</li>\n<li>Jenga</li>\n<li>Pictureka</li></ul>Those three games are also available for the Wii, but as a part of the retail game Family Game Night 2.\n\nThe Wii version includes a Party mode (only for human players) with a mixed-up mish-mash of each of the six games and rules similar to the Mario Party series. Most games can be played with up to four players, except for the PlayStation 2 version where only two players can compete.",

Players then take turns firing at the grid to try and locate the ship. During the placement ships can be rotated with a key and there is also an option to auto deploy all of them. The game offers three modes:<ul>\n<li>Original: classic rules, players take turns firing a single shot.</li><br>\n<li>Salvo: players can fire as many shots as there are ships left. So five shots per turn in the beginning, and less when some of the player's ship are sunk, based on the fleet count.</li><br>\n<li>Super Weapons is very different and borrows many elements from the <i>Electronic Battleship Advanced Mission</i> board game to introduce more strategy. There are reinforcements with a small patrol boat, lucky shots (can take out an entire ship when they hit), heavy shots (target five squares at once), decoys (show a random hit or miss, regardless of the actual situation), torpedoes (travel through an entire column until they hit a ship), and random power-ups.</li></ul>Next to those main modes there is a custom mode where individual features can be enabled. There are three difficulty levels, and multiplayer is available locally and through Xbox Live.",

The closer to the bulls-eye it lands, the more points are provided. Other players can also slide their pieces and knock yours off. The real goal however is to bring all pieces home by spending points and moving up a ladder. In some cases it is therefore needed to score only a minimum amount of points.\n\nThe pieces are thrown with the left analog stick and the bumpers are used to aim. Next to the classic game there are different advanced variants with a swirling vortex in the middle instead of a bulls-eye, or a black hole that sends the pieces back to the starting position. There are also battle boxes in the target zone that provide power-ups for your pieces. They become very tiny for instance (and are hard to hit for opponents) or become transparent ghosts unaffected by other pieces in the way.

      "description": "<i>FunTown Mahjong</i> is a simulation of the Chinese tile game. Unlike many other electronic conversions, it is the classic game and not the two-tile-matching casual variant. It can be played in singleplayer with anime-like avatars against AI opponents, online against human players, and there is a tutorial that explains the basics. The game is played around a table with the other opponents visible and the tiles are formed in the middle.\n\nThe game is played with 144 tiles. These are divided into three categories (Suits, Honors, and Flowers). Suits again consist of three categories: Dots, Bamboos, and Characters, and each of those if further broken down in sets of nine, with numbers from one to nine. The Characters category comes with nine styles with four identical tiles for each one, and the same principle applies to Bamboos and Dots. The amount of Honors is much smaller: there are seven, one for each wind direction, and three dragons. Finally, Flowers consist of eight tiles - four flowers and four seasons.\n\nIn the beginning of the game each players rolls dice and after that the tiles are distributed. To win the game, the player has to make a complete Meld. It consists of five sets of Straights (three suited tiles) or Triples (three tiles of the same), and a pair of Eyes (two tiles of the same). Players do not only need to watch the numbers, but the categories as well for combinations. When a complete Meld is formed, it looks like a human figure with eyes, a trunk, arms and legs (consisting of six combinations), but that structure is not shown in-game, it needs to be visualized internally.\n\nA typical Mahjong is played with four players. One of them is the dealer. He provides sixteen tiles to each player and also makes the first move. The tiles are placed in front of the player, similar to Scrabble, and can freely be arranged. When it's the player's turn, he receives a new tile and at the end of the turn a tile needs to be discarded on the board in the middle. When you receive a flower tile you need to leave it face-up in front of your other tiles and draw another one to replace it. Four types of moves are possible: Chow, Pung, Kong, and Draw, for which the rules are out of the scope of this game entry. It is possible to keep track of the other players' progress by watching their exposed Kongs and Pungs.\n\nPulling the trigger changed the angle from top-down (best to view the board) to first-person. <i>FunTown Mahjong</i> is based on the Taiwanese variant with 16 tiles and does not include other rulesets, like Hong Kong or the official competitive Chinese rules for example.",

      "description": "<i>Gin Rummy</i> is an electronic simulation of the card game of the same name. Generally it is a two-player game, but this version supports up to four players online with teams of two playing against each other. A standard deck of 52 cards is used and they each receive a ranking, from ace (one point) to the three face cards (Jack, Queen King) worth ten points. The dealer deals ten cards to each player. Two piles are made in the middle: a discard pile (face-up) and the stock pile (face-down). Each turn players draw one card, from any pile, and also have to discard one card. The goal of the game is to score most points by forming melds (consists of sets and runs) and eliminating deadwood. A set is three or four cards of the same rank (three times a five for instance) and a run is three or more cards of the same suit in consecutive order (four, five, and six of spades for instance). The useless cards that remain in the player's hand are the deadwood.\n\nThe game can be ended by a player who has a hand of sets and runs and the points value of the remaining deadwood totals equal or less than ten points. This is called knocking. Knocking is optional when the above requirements are met and required when the deadwood equals zero (called \"going Gin\"). At that moment the other player still has a chance to win. When a player announces to knock, he lays his hand out with the melds and deadwood separated. The other player can then reduce his deadwood by laying off any cards that fit into the first player's meld, thereby reducing his deadwood. A lay-off is not allowed when the first player went Gin. After that, the points are counted, along with different types of bonus scores.\n\nThe game is played from a first-person perspective and includes a tutorial to get familiar with the rules of Gin Rummy. The game supports the Vision camera. While playing cards can also be sorted manually to get a good overview. The game includes different variants of Gin, each with their own rules:<ul>\n<li>Classic Gin Rummy</li>\n<li>Oklahoma Gin</li>\n<li>Hollywood Gin</li>\n<li>3-hand Gin</li>\n<li>Speed Gin Rimmy</li>\n<li>Custom Gin Rummy where you can alter the rules</li></ul>",

It stays true to the original game, but offers a few options to alter the rules, such as determining the number of match points to win the game (with a maximum of 129 points) or disallowing use of the doubling cube. The game can be played alone, with three different difficulty levels, or against another player as both local and online multiplayer games are supported. Also included is a number of tutorials that explain the basic rules. Pressing a button rolls the dice and after that all open moves can be cycled to insert checkers. Dots indicate where the pieces can land. However, indicators do not mark where a checker could move if you combine dice totals, a feature sometimes supported by other titles.",

      "description": "<i>Risk: Factions</i> is an electronic variant of the Hasbro strategy board game <i>Risk</i>, but it has been streamlined from the board game version to speed up gameplay. The gameplay is based on the boardgame's 2008 set of rules, and also adds overkill (more damage when rolling two or three 6s - two removes four units, three removes them all), specific faction abilities (to use a fourth die in certain circumstances), and dynamic terrain to the rules.\n\nThe game is based on each player controlling a different section of board, and attacking an enemy's territory as well as defending his own. The original board game is won by whoever takes over the entire map first. Conflicts are resolved by each player taking a turn to roll the dice based, reducing the opponent's strength with each roll. Whoever has units standing at the end of the conflict gets to occupy the territory. However, in <i>Risk: Factions</i>, the single player game is won by the person who completes three objectives and controls his capital at the end of the game. Objectives include having to take certain territories and capturing a certain amount of power plants. This mode of play is dubbed the Command Room. For conquered territory players receive stars (cards in the original game) that can be traded in for new troops at the next turn. No more than two stars can be collected per turn.\n\nThe original board game version is also available to play as Classic Risk. Players can control one of five different factions: the Humans, Robots, Cats, Zombies and the Yeti, each with their own unique leader. The singleplayer is divided into five different chapter and each one unlocks a new faction. Playable maps include the original map from the board game, as well as several new ones designed for <i>Factions</i>. The game comes with both online and offline multiplayer support. Online, you can team up with up to four other people for a five-player game. Offline, you can play in a four-player game, in co-op, or play on your own against other people, again using the original Risk rules or the new Command Room style.",
