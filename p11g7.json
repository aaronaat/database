      "description": "The Mad Overlord Trebor was once only power-mad, but went off the deep end after he acquired a magical amulet of immense power, only to have it stolen from him by his nemesis, the evil archmage Werdna. Werdna, not quite sure how to use the amulet properly, accidentally causes an earthquake which creates a ten-level dungeon beneath Trebor's castle. To avoid looking silly, Werdna declares the dungeon to be the new lair for him and his monster hordes. Trebor, not to be outdone, declares the labyrinth his new Proving Grounds where adventurers must prove themselves for membership in his elite honor guard, and incidentally retrieve his amulet in the process.\n\nThe first <i>Wizardry</i> was one of the original dungeon-crawling role-playing games, and stands along with  Ultima and  Might & Magic as one of the defining staples of the genre.\n\nThe player generates and control a party of up to six different adventurers, choosing from four races (humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes and hobbits), three alignments (good, neutral and evil), and four basic classes (fighter, priest, mage and thief). These can later evolve into elite classes (bishop: priest with mage spells; samurai: fighter with mage spells; lord: fighter with priest spells, and ninja: fighter with thief abilities) if they meet the necessary level requirements. After outfitting the party with basic weapons and armor, the player sends it into a 3D vector maze-like dungeon to fight monsters in turn-based combat and find treasure.",

      "description": "<i>Wizardry: Knight of Diamonds</i> is the sequel to Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord. It is an early example of an expansion pack, requiring the player to have the original Wizardry installed to play. It uses the same engine and spells, but is scaled for importing existing characters rather than creating a new party. Players explore a 3D wire frame maze searching for a key item, the Staff of Gnilda, required to complete the game. The player creates a party of up to 6 characters of various classes, and then gain experience points by fighting random encounters. The maze has many hidden doors and secrets, so the player is encouraged to map out each floor on graph paper to find their way.\n\nThe story takes place after the events of the first game. The mad king Trebor has committed suicide after becoming obsessed with the amulet and fearing the return of Werdna. With both Trebor and Werdna dead all seemed well within the kingdom of Llylgamyn. Unfortunately, this peace didn't last very long. With Werdna dead and out of the limelight, an evil knight named Davalpus felt it was time to make his move. He stormed the castle, slaughtered the royal family, and declared himself supreme dictator for life. The Prince of the land fought and killed Davalpus using the legendary Staff of Gnilda and wearing the armor of the Knight of Diamonds. However, the god Gnilda took the staff back and placed it deep within his heavily guarded six-level temple. Since the staff's power protects the land from invasion by hostile outlanders, someone will need to venture into the temple and get the staff back along with Gnilda's blessing. \n\nThough <i>Knight of Diamonds</i> is the second scenario in the series, it was the third game in the series released for Famicom/NES. The NES version was redesigned to be played by new parties and the maps were re-designed to be non-linear. This makes the NES version more like a unique entry in the series rather than a port of the computer versions. The Famicom version is compatible with the ASCII TurboFile, an accessory that allowed the player to transfer characters between the Famicom Wizardry games. This feature was removed from the NES version. The Famicom version also allowed the player to switch between English and Japanese text.",

But now nature itself seems to be attacking the land of Llylgamyn, as earthquakes and tidal waves ravage the land. The Sages believe the Orb of Scrying is the city's salvation, but it is guarded by the dragon L'kbreth. A band of explorers must once again venture forth in search of the Orb.\n\n<i>Legacy of Llylgamyn</i> is the third entry in the <i>Wizardry</i> series. Like its predecessors, it is a first-person dungeon-crawling role-playing game in which the player assembles a party of up to six characters and explores a large maze-like dungeon, fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat and occasionally returning to the game's only town to rest, buy supplies, and outfit the characters. Characters must be imported from either the first or the second game. \n\nCharacter classes, combat system, and overall gameplay mechanics are very similar to those of the two previous games. Good, evil and neutral alignment, however, plays a larger role. While the first level of the dungeon is accessible to everyone, the other five levels impose alignment restrictions, requiring the party either to have at least one good or bad character, or contain no neutral characters.",

(previously released on Game Boy) and D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu II: Lost in Las Vegas. Deja Vu is a port of a 1987 game that had been made for various systems. It's a classic detective story, with you waking up to a dead body with total amnesia - you don't know who you are, or how you got there, and you don't know who the corpse is, either. D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu II had never been released for Game Boy before, and was put in the same cart, selling for the price of one game.",

      "description": "The first handheld <i>Sakura Taisen</i> game, released between the second and the third main ones, takes place in the original setting: the imperial capital in Japan of 1920s. It is the Taishou era, time of rapid technological development and acquaintance with Western lifestyle in Japan. Disguised as a group of actresses in the imperial theater, the Hanagumi Brigade consists of lovely ladies who are at the same time skilled fighters, able to pilot mechs, and to confront the forces of evil that threaten Japan. A new commander of Hanagumi arrives at the theater to work under the guidance of Ichiro Ogami, the main hero of the series. He leads the beautiful girls Sakura, Sumire, Honglan, and others into battle against demons.\n\nAs in most other games in the series, <i>Sakura Taisen GB</i> is a mixture of Japanese-style adventure with dating mechanics and tactical turn-based battles. The light RPG angle is also present, as the girls fight differently depending on how the protagonist treats them. Unlike other Sakura Taisen games, the battles here are entirely menu-driven. Also, the main plot is non-linear, and it is possible to reach fourteen different endings, which also include bad ones. The hero may even get thrown out of the theater for indecent behavior.",

Safely reaching Lamini, or Land of Towers, the friendly people of the land help repair the damaged ship. As the crew members are looking for a job, they meet the Mayor of the town who is in need of messengers. He tells the adventurers that Lord Baniff has not been heard from in weeks, and that he needs them to seek him out in his Tower and bring word of his condition. Entering the doorway into the Tower, the entrance collapses behind them and they must find their way out.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay is similar to other first-person realtime D&D games like the <a href=\"http://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?q=eye+of+the+beholder\">Eye of the Beholder</a> series, though not as complex. There are four characters in the game and you choose one to control. Spell incantations are learned from scrolls and are cast by combining the correct syllables. There are 15 levels to explore and tons of monsters and items to find. You can play the game in cooperative mode with another player using a link cable.",

Once again you take control of the wily adventurer Goemon and his buddies as they travel through feudal Japan fighting evil in its wackiest incarnations. This time around an evil warlord seems to have taken control of Edo castle and used the place to flood all of Japan with strange demons. \n\nThe gameplay is similar to the other RPGs in the series, in which you control your party from an overhead map and explore each area getting quests and items in order to advance the main plot. While you control a party, combat is strictly one-on-one, as the game attempts to join the Pok\u00e9mon craze with \"dueling\" combat between individual monsters. Additionally, you can capture and train the monsters you defeat, and even upgrade them or merge them with other creatures to obtain additional powers. The game can also connect with the similarly-themed Mononoke Sugoroku for the N64, in order to transfer and exchange monsters between both titles.",

They love to dance, sing, and slowly learn human speech. Specifically a Furby is an autonomous toy robot manufactured by Tiger Electronics, licensor of this game. These toys were among the first successful domestic robots. Here they will be dancing for you. \n\n<i>Dancing Furby</i> operates as a classic rhythm game, with a line of button prompts scrolling across the screen that you will have to press when they reach the current time mark, supposedly matched with the music.  A Furby on screen will dance in accordance with your performance, commenting on your timing in Furbish, \"noo-loo\" being perfect, \"e-day\" being acceptable, and \"boo\" is shrilled for failure. At the end of each song you'll have you score calculated in \"noo-loo\"'s etc. and then be allowed to continue.\n\nSuccessfully clearing a stage will result in you being able to 'connect' the Game Boy's infrared port with the matching port on the forehead of a Furby toy. This will impart information about the song to your furby teaching it to warble F\u00fcr Elise when you least expect it.\n\nYou may also select a Furby to dance with in the game, be it spotted, striped, or lozenge-faced. Good performance will unlock more Furbies.\n\nSongs in the game include Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, F\u00fcr Elise, and a few 'popular' numbers.",

      "description": "Based on the 2001 movie starring Brendan Frasier and Rachel Weisz, this version differs greatly from it's console version.  The main bulk of the game is side-scroller with stages where the player moves from right to left trying to escape a wall of water while avoiding enemies and pitfalls and even a scene recreating the valley escape in the blimp, but with the same elements.  There are also one-on-one sword fighting stages where the player uses a sword to hack away at enemies that appear one at a time and even a first-person shooting stage that resembles Lethal Enforcers.\n\nThere are three different characters to choose from, Rick O'Connel, Evelyn O'Connel and Ardeth Bay that they can choose at the beginning of each stage, each with their own strengths and weaknesses and depending on which character they pick will determine which stage layout will be present (ex. Rick & Evelyn's water escape stage feature different traps and enemies they must avoid).\n\nThere are eleven stages total and a password feature that allows players to pick up and play at their leisure.",

The basic story in Love Hina centers around a young boy, Keitaro Urashima, trying to fulfill his promise to a girl he shortly met as a child but whose name he has forgotten. Their promise was to study hard and get accepted at Tokyo University, where they could meet once again. While studying for exam, Keitaro is staying at his grandmother's hotel which seem to be inhabited by girls only. As a new manager of the hotel, he is having a plethora of ups and downs in his relationship with the girls, and one of them even turns out to be the very girl he made a promise to.\n\nThis game puts you in shoes of Keitaro himself as he resumes his duties of a hotel manager. During adventure mode, you can check certain predefined locations and speak with characters you meet, sometimes selecting your answer during conversation. Sometimes during the story, the girls in Hinata apartments will ask you quiz questions about the Love Hina anime. The action mode in the game is done via four different mini-games which, unlike the adventure mode, use 3rd-person perspective.",

During the holidays, Conan and Ran decide to meet at a certain cafe. While there, Ran runs into her classmate Miki by chance, who is part-time working at that very cafe. In turn, Miki calls them to come to her place where she tells them about her worrying about her sister Satomi. Apparently she said she's going on a trip as she was heading out, but she never called or told Miki where she went. She is a rather methodical person, which makes her behavior suspiciously strange, and Miki asks Ran and Conan to help her find her sister. Also, before she went out, she was acting strange according to Miki. After listening in more detail and agreeing to help Miki look for Satomi, Conan and Ran head to Satomi's room to look for clues about her whereabouts. There they find out what was a direction to a secluded old temple and with that as their only lead to go on, they set out to find Satomi.\n\nExploring locations is done in top-down perspective which also allows you to switch between characters, thus not controlling Conan alone. The map system shows you your current location. Message system is used for dialogues with other characters which uses typical first person view displaying the talking character and the text below the character image. On your investigation while searching for clues and talking to other characters, you will obtain keywords which lets you think the case through and after collecting the necessary keywords, you can start the reasoning process. Conan also keeps track on characters he meets, and you can access character profiles from the in-game menu, the same way you access keywords or map system.",

      "description": "<i>10-nenme no Shoutaijou</i> (10\u5e74\u76ee\u306e\u62db\u5f85\u72b6) is the mystery adventure game from <i>Kindaichi Shounen no Jikenbo</i> (\u91d1\u7530\u4e00\u5c11\u5e74\u306e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7c3f) series based on manga series, which in turn also spanned the TV series. The series are centered around a high-school student, Hajime Kindaichi, who has the knack for solving crimes, much like Shinichi Kudou, better known as Conan Edogawa from <i>Meitantei Conan</i> series. The game is presented in a visual novel style with typical commands for reading through the on screen text and going though the message log. The investigation screen is done in a form of top-down map where you can investigate different locations and look for clues.\n\nAkira Kawai, a first-year student of a Fudou high-school received a mysterious letter with ominous sketch and the text saying \"I'll be waiting at the Shiomisou inn.\", sender or reason for sending this letter is unknown. Upon reading this himself, Hajime Kindaichi, along with Miyuki Nanase decided to check if there's more to the meaning of the letter or if it's nothing but a prank of a sort. Upon arriving at the Shiomisou inn, which was in a rather secluded and silent place surrounded by mountain on one side, and a sea on the other, he noticed there are only three more guests besides them. Could one of them be the sender of this letter? The night came swiftly and the weather turned gloomy. There and then, Hajime runs into Kengo Akechi, a detective investigating a report of a supposed seeing of a killer in the area from a 10-year old case. With approaching storm, the scream echoes through the hallway and first in the series of murders engulfs this hotel in an aura of tension. Kindaichi and Akechi are now more than ever determined to get to the bottom of this and catch the murderer behind this.",

It offers single games for one or two players, a tournament mode consisting of four rounds and progress stored via passwords, and a practice option that allows setting up any pin combination to knock down.\n\nBefore a game, players can select from five different characters, each with different statistics, and select whether they are right- or left-handed. After aligning the ball on the alley, the throwing is done with four consecutive button pushes. The first starts the curve meter, while the second stops it to select the ball curve. The third determines the power of the throw on the power meter, and the final one must be matched to a goal spot for best accuracy.",
