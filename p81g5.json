      "description": "<i>Carnivores 2</i> is a hunting simulation in the vein of Deer Hunter. Instead of hunting cute woodland creatures however the player gets to hunt big, hungry dinosaurs. The story is set in the far future and mankind has mastered galactic travel. On a distant watery planet we discover species completely identical to Earth's ancient dinosaurs living quite happily on a series of lush islands. Being the enlightened galaxy-spanning species that we are, we decide to bring in a bunch of big-game hunters to blow their brains out and bring em' home stuffed and mounted.\n\nIn the PC version there is a total of nine huntable dinosaurs, as well as several additional species which serve to populate the environment. The latter can be shot too, but they are not rewarded with kill trophies. The game is set in an open environment played from a first-person perspective. The dinosaur-hunting company has provided a gun, a map, some binoculars, a \"dinosaur call whistle\"  and a license to kill things. The player travels through woods, climbs mountains, and even picks through the decrepit remains of deserted research outposts in the search for the next kill. The game requires a tactical approach. Dinosaurs have keen hearing, sight, and smell and will run away if they detect the presence of a hunter. Often a downwind approach is needed, and the hunter needs to hide behind a rock or tree, and uses a mating call to lure them in for the perfect shot. Of course the highlight of the game is the challenge in hunting hunters, the carnivores.\n\nCarnivores will stalk the hunter whether he is hunting them or he is just passing through their territory. The whistle's herbivore mating call or the sound of gunfire may inadvertedly alert them to the hunter's presence and location. Instead of charging head-on into the waiting maw of the shotgun, they can circle through the underbrush, dodging out of sight and ambushing from the sides. Despite their aggressiveness they are not stupid. If the hunter camps out in a clearing on top of a hill with a sniper rifle they will stay in the woods instead of charging out into the open where a clear shot is much easier. The exception to this is the huge Tyrannosaurus, who are disdainful of the puny bullets and will simply charge like an oncoming freight train.\n\nThe hunter starts in the woods with a pistol stalking herbivores. Each killed dinosaur earns points which can be spent on better weapons (six in total), new areas such as marshlands and deserts, or the right to hunt a larger selection of dinosaurs including carnivores. The more expensive dinosaurs get fiercer and bigger, and eventually enough points will be earned for the privilege of challenging the T-Rex.\n\nThe iOS, Android and Mini versions are enhanced ports of the original game. Next to the updated graphics it adds the Pachycephalosaurus, Amargasaurus, Oviraptor, Utahraptor, and Troodon as new dinosaurs and Ravaren's Bridge from Carnivores: Ice Age as a new map. From that game also comes the supply ship that picks up the corpses and a photo camera to take pictures of the animals in an exploration-type game mode free of blood. A relocate option allows the hunter to start at a new location during a single hunt. It can be used multiple times and also refreshes the supplies. Next to the the original Hunt mode these versions add a Survive mode where the hunter needs to stay alive as long as possible. The wind locator has been moved inside the compass to make more room on the screen. Most of the new content was not available right away, but added in gradually through updates. The hunter is controlled through a virtual d-pad on the left side of the screen and on the right side two icons can be tapped quickly to call an animal or to draw a gun and aim. For Android an iOS there is a free-to-play version with microtransactions. In the Android version two additional bundles can be purchased to expand the game and access everything, while for iOS there is a separate commercial app with everything unlocked.",

      "description": "<i>Carnivores: Ice Age</i> is third game in the hunting series. This version is set on the Arctic regions of planet FMM UV-32. Scientists of DinoHunt Corp. discovered that animals from the Ice Age still live there and they establish a hunting program. The player roams the planet using a mini-map, a compass and an assortment of guns to hunt down the animals. Unlike the previous PC games this title does not feature any dinosaurs (except for the prehistoric bird diatryma). The game uses the same engine as the previous titles and has five main areas: McRath Island, Ravaren's Bridge, Ring of Infernus, Dry Nodus Lake, and The Giant's Boot\u2014each with their own difficulty level. Just like the previous games animals do not leave behind tracks, despite the snow. The available weapons are largely identical to the earlier versions and include a a pistol, shotgun, rifle, crossbow, double-barreled shotgun, and sniper rifle. The included animals in the PC version are brontotherium, dire wolf, wild boar, woolly rhinoceros, diatryma, giant deer, smilodon (sabre-tooth tiger), woolly mammoth, cave bear, yeti, archaeopteryx, and the pig.\n\nThere are no missions in the game. The player selects what to hunt and the weapon, and then enters an area. It is always possible to leave as well. During the game points need to be earned. They are spent to customize hunts, as certain weapons, areas and animals cost more. Initially, only weaker animals (herbivores) and weapons are available until a sufficient amount of points has been earned. All animals are however able to kill the hunter. As in the previous games tranquilizers can be used instead of bullets, but these do not lead to trophies for kills. Points can also be spent on camouflage, a radar, or to cover scent. Hunting is done with a realistic approach as the animals need to be called to lure them and the player has to position himself against the wind, avoid noises and stay out of sight. The areas are open-ended and once again have a day-and-night cycle. A difference compared to the previous games is that here the weak points of the animals are not shown and they are generally more resistant to damage. \n\nThe enhanced iOS version features ten animals. The hunter is controlled through a virtual d-pad on the left side of the screen and on the right side two icons can be tapped quickly to call an animal or to draw a gun and aim. It also includes the ability to relocate to another place once inside a hunt. This can be done more than once and also refreshes the supplies. The Survive training exercise mode from the previous iOS game is not present. The iOS edition has a free-to-play version where additional animals, weapons and areas need to be bought through in-game purchases, next to a commercial release where everything is unlocked. In the PS3/PSP mini version the killing animations were toned down and corpses disappear instead of being picked up by a dropship.",

Choose five, ten, or fifteen minute quarters for either league match (single game) or tournament play.\r\n\r\nThere are 12 teams from NFL cities to play with (six East, six West), although there is no NFL license and no real NFL players.  Offensive plays can be run from five basic formations: long pass, short pass, quarterback sneak, running backs, and field goal kick/punt.  There are no formations or plays on defense, but there are two possible players (A or B button) to take control of before the snap.  The player perspective is top-down and vertical-scrolling.  Standard football scoring rules: most points after four quarters wins!\r\n",

Winning in tournaments rewards world ranking points which unlock new characters to use, each with different attributes and skills, and extra items to use. This includes unrealistic ones like the wave racket which floods the opponent's side. Sometimes the player finds himself paired up against characters from other Namco games, e.g. Pac Man or Heihachi Mishima from the Tekken series.\n\nThe four-player multiplayer modes doesn't only include regular matches, but also the bomb ball mode. Here players have to play with live bombs and try not be the nearest player when it goes off.",

      "description": "A chaotic, and bouncy rally racing game.  One of the aspects of this game that set it aside from other games at this time was the variety of the terrain.  Not only is it off-road, but the course is filled with jumps, dips, hairpins, and off camber turns.   Consequently, it is very common for the car to flip upside down.  By pressing the shoulder buttons, the player can rock the car left or right.  To get back on the tires, the user must time the rocking of the car to flip it back upright.  \r\n\r\nAny of the course can be raced forwards or backwards, and there is a season mode as well as the single race mode.  In order to increase the chaos, there is a suicide-mode where you race the course in the opposite direction of the other cars.  Up to 4 players can play the game in split screen mode.  Tracks include a tight Stadium course, an abandoned mine, jungle, and desert.  \r\n\r\nOne trick to increase performance is that the buttons that rock the car upright, can also be used to prevent flipping in tight corners. Mud, dirt, snow, and water are kicked up behind the car to add some graphical flair.  The cars in the game are not licensed vehicles.\r\n",

Start with the 500cc sleds, win races, upgrade your snowmobile, and unlock higher end sleds and new courses.. And, if you're looking for even more challenges, race head-to-head with your friends, go vertical on hill-climbing tracks, or create your own courses with the included track editor.\n\nThe PC conversion has a higher polygon count, higher resolution on the textures, and more accurate physics.",

As a reward for knocking down all ten pins, you will also get the score from your next bowl doubled if this took 2 shots (known as a 'spare'), or your next two bowls if it took 2 shots (known as a 'Strike').\r\n\r\nIn this implementation, you can play in one of 8 different settings, including a tropical island, ancient Egypt or on a pirate ship. There are 8 different AI players, each with varied appearance and reaction, and variable bowling ability. A range of playing modes including Tournament Play, Skins and practice are featured.

All have their own personal reasons in catching the King River fish and are subject to different story plots. Each also have different starting character statistics.\n\n<b>GAMEPLAY</b>\n\nGameplay of the Harvest Fishing may be categorized as the following:\n\n<li><b>Real-time Fishing Simulation and Preparation</b><br>\nThe fishing simulation in Harvest Fishing consists of various approaches which refer to different types of tools you can choose from to fish: Different fishing rods, different baits and lures attract different fish, making some easier or harder depending on which combination you choose. Fishing instruments may be purchased at a local store, while bait may either be purchased or be searched in your surroundings.\n\nYou start with one type of rod and minimal bait varieties. Catching fish requires you to fish near a body of water and wait for the fish to bite (results vary on different rods). After a bite, you enter a real-time fishing simulation sequence, where you can visibly see the fish underwater. You then have to lure the fish in while making sure your fishing line doesn't break. Captured fish may then be released, sold at the fishmonger for money or used for cooking ingredients or other requirements for sub-quests.\n\nFailure to catch fish during this simulation will result in your character losing HP as well as the bait.\n\n<li><b>Adventuring</b><br>\nThere are a lot of fishing spots to choose from in this game. The others however must be first unlocked by following the plot of the story. Several mini-quests are also available to choose as well as participating in fishing and cooking tournaments.\n\nSuccessfully catching fish will add experience to your fishing skill which will lead to leveling up your fishing level. Successfully trying cooking recipes will also increase your cooking level skill.",

Get equipment and trainers for your fighter to enhance his look and performance.\n\nThen take your fighter to career mode where you'll play fight your way up from the local gym all the way up to five-star venues. Get trainers to enhance your training and boost your speed and power. Play against randomly generated fighters all the way up through the ranks till you beat them in points or to a pulp. Certain fights may get you a bit of extra money as an incentive, or give you a promotional deal, but pick your fights carefully because strategy inside the ring won't matter if you mismanage your fisher outside.\n\nFight smart during the fight by using the total punch control system to throw the punches you want to by using the analog stick. The total punch control system maps your fists to the analog stick getting rid of the need for senseless button mashing.\n\nYou can also play in historical fights like Taylor vs. Hopkins, Gatti vs. Ward, or Robinson vs. Lamotta in the ESPN Classic mode to play in the fights that made boxing history.\n\nOnce you've got the computer down for the count, you can play with any fighter or user created fighters or any of the ESPN Classic fights in local multiplayer with a friend. You can also take the fight online and prove your the real champion of the world against any opponent anytime, anywhere.",

The game modes feature Time Trial, Quick Race, Race Weekend, World Champion, Career and several online game modes. All official drivers, teams and circuits from the 2006 season are present. Numerous options and driving aids allow you to customise the experience to suit your skill and preferences - from arcade style, to full technical simulation.\n\nOther improvements over the previous games in the series include high-definition graphics, full surround sound and support for the SIXAXIS controller. Players can choose to steer the cars by tilting the controller. Pitstops can be planned prior to the race and a safety car has been added to slow down the race when an accident occurs.",

You create your own character and play to reach the number one rank on the world ranking list.\n\nVirtua Tennis 3 is not a simulation like Top Spin 2 and only needs three buttons to perform all possible shot. Still time needs to be invested in training the character through several mini-games in which need you to hit a circle on the other side of the net or defeat aliens by hitting them with returns.\n\nYou can also play as one of the professionals against the CPU or a friend (or two if you play a Double). True to the series of the home version, there are also 12 mini-games available to play against your friends. These include the ones from the World Tour training as well as different ones like Curling or Super-Bingo. The Tournament Mode and Exhibition Mode are also present in the arcade version, but the Challenge Mode has been replaced by the World Tour Mode and Party Mode.",

      "description": "This golfing simulation game is the 2007 multi-platform edition of Electronic Arts' Tiger Woods PGA Tour franchise.  Although the game's features differ across platforms, most notably from next-gen to current-gen, it has a few things in common across the board: more licensed players, more courses, more game modes, and improved GameFace character creation.\n\n<i>Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07</i> on Xbox 360 and PS3 feature more realistic characters thanks to the all-new Universal Capture (UCAP) technology. UCAP is the same technique that was used on <i>The Matrix</i> films to generate digital doubles for the lead actors. Another next-gen-only feature that the Xbox 360 and PS3 share is larger crowds and mass movement of spectators from hole-to-hole, as well as PIP cameras. There is also an enhanced career mode where you can master your skills in a new Practice Facility. The golfers have a new animation state engine that yields more pertinent emotions and reactions based on what happens in gameplay. The game setup has been changed, with different swing styles, and the Speed Golf setting which allows players to skip to the next shot after the ball has been struck without watching where the ball lands.\n\nPS2 and Xbox versions of the game feature a new team tour mode where you can recruit your own squad of golfers to go up against Team Tiger Woods. The PC, PS2, and Xbox versions have the most licensed golfers (21) in the game. The Wii edition of the game features the ability to control your swing using the Wiimote.",

      "description": "The 2008 edition in the Tiger Woods PGA series introduces enhancements and improvements to the previous version without major graphical or gameplay changes. There are new courses (Xbox 360/PS3: 5 new, 16 in total - PS2: 6 new, 18 in total) and different licensed professional golf players to choose from (21 on the Xbox 360/PS3 - 23 on the PS2/Wii).\n\nThe Xbox 360, PS2, PS3 and Windows versions allow players to import photos to create in-game faces on the characters based on custom images, using the Xbox Live Vision camera, PlayStation EyeToy, PlayStation Eye or a webcam. Further customizations include clothing, hair or eye color and more. The initial statistics can be improved by completing challenges based on power or putting precision. They can also be raised by performing well in the PGA Tour, taking into account skill shots and not just the overall ranking. Players can unlock additional golfers and spend their winnings in the shop on new equipment.\n\nThe game incorporates the FedExCup championship format (a collection of tournaments) with rounds of golf at Westchester Country Club, TPC Boston, Cog Hill, and East Lake. The putt preview has been improved, allowing the player to simulate the ball's path once per individual spot, taking into accounts elements such as power, speed and elevation. On the Xbox 360 and the PS3, shots are not performed using the analog stick, but with the 3-point timed principle for start, power and accuracy. Shot Confidence is a new addition, keeping track of the player's performance on certain courses, for specific puts and using certain clubs. Great performances raise the confidence, which translates into experience and better performance on specific courses. Low confidence leads to lower accuracy, a pumping heartbeat, and rumbling controls on the Wii.\n\nThe multiplayer (up to 4 players) has been expanded with GamerNet, where players can create and play custom challenges with their scores posted online (Xbox 360/PS3/Windows).\n\nOn the Wii, players can shake the controls to taunt the opponents with 4 different moves, to throw them off. It can be used to influence air conditions, spin, or adds audio distractions. The controls are available in 3 modes: Full Swing (wii remote), Sitting Swing (new, waggle the wii remote) or the classic controls using the nunchuck for analog play. In Full Swing, twisting the wii remote adds hooks and slices prior to shots. Also exclusive to the Wii is a Miniputt mode.",

      "description": "The 2008 edition of the long-running EA FIFA football franchise improves upon the gameplay and the features of the previous installments. The next-generation version marks the second regular appearance of the series on the Xbox 360 and the first on the PS3. Compared to the previous year, the game now includes the full roster of teams and leagues, same as on other versions: 620 licensed teams, 30 national leagues, with the addition of the Hyundai A-League (Australia), Czech Gambrinus Liga (Czech Republic) and FAI Premier Division (Ireland). As usual, the leagues have been updated with new teams and prominent football countries (England, France, Germany, Italy and Spain) have multiple divisions. There are also 23 clubs from around the world not featured in specific leagues.\n\nGameplay changes include a revised shooting simulation, where factors such as position, defence, speed, bounce and direction weigh in. This is a continuation of the dynamic shooting meter from the previous version, where the position and a shot power meter make for powerful distance shots. There is also more attention to through-balls, more fluent animations and skill moves, revamped crowd, cheering and stadium animations, and a redesigned tackle system. Next to the known modes, \"Be A Pro\" is introduced where players take control of a single, fixed player on the field. It is not a career mode, but mainly an alternative way to play the games. Online multiplayer options allow players to form a team of independently controlled players, with 10 human-controlled players at the same time in a single match. The camera is changed for this mode, to constantly keep the specific player, but also the action in focus. There are also the returning online interactive leagues, with full national leagues against other players on EA servers. The game also comes with the tools to set up independent multiplayer games and organize tournaments.\n\n<i>FIFA Soccer 08</i> contains licensed music tracks from all around the world. Brazilian player Ronaldinho is the poster boy for this version, only replaced with prominent national players for specific localized versions, especially for the European countries.",

      "description": "In <i>Skydiving Extreme</i> you try to maneuver your team of skydivers into different formations in an odd mix of skydiving simulation and rhythm gameplay. You can practice your moves or compete against another player or computer.\n\nWhen beginning a game, your chosen team of four skydivers will jump and then you have a limited time to complete more four-person formations than your opponent.  Doing a correct formation will slow your descent, giving you more time to execute more tricks.  To perform a formation correctly you must correctly enter the button sequence displayed on the screen within a short period of time. If you do this correctly your four skydivers will move into the formation. Formations are performed in sequence; if you miss one you must return to the beginning of the sequence and start over. You try to do as many tricks as possible before your team falls too low and they must pull their parachutes.\n\nYou can also \"attack\" your opponent - by performing tricks successfully you fill up your attack meter.  When it is full you can execute an attack and force the other team to defend itself by performing a defensive formation. If the other team fails in its defense, it will fall at a higher rate of speed.",

      "description": "<i>skate.</i> is the first in-house developed skateboarding game by Electronic Arts, after publishing the Street Sk8er series in the past. Players can create a custom-design character and move it through the fictional town of San Vanelona. To become a top skater, players has to enter skating challenges marked on the map to gain notability, attracting sponsors and having tricks photographed or filmed. By performing well, spots can be \"owned\", and there are also jam sessions and death races against other skaters. Completing challenges is also rewarded with new equipment, clothing, characters and additional challenges.\n\nThere are two different paths to follow: Skateboard Mag and Trasher, both with the aim to get coverage in different magazines. The Skateboard Mag path follows a more formal career skater format, where progress through the path relies on completing photo moments, demos, contests and filming parts. The Thrasher is more of an anti-authority path, with downhill races, and screwing with security. By completing either path the player gets access to the Xgames, and the mega-ramp, which is a gigantic ramp based on a real construction.\n\nUnlike the Tony Hawk series, movement and tricks are entirely controlled through the analog sticks.\n\nskate.reel and the in-game replay editor allow players to go back at any time and look over there last 15-25 seconds of gameplay and view it from multiple angles. That footage can also be uploaded directly to the skate.reel website, where players vote for their favorite footage. The game supports online play with a number of challenges duplicated from the offline game as well as some unique online modes.\n\nThe game comes with a number of famous skaters, for which the appearance was licensed.",

      "description": "<i>PES 2008</i> updates the clubs and players for the 2007/2008 season, this time including some never before featured clubs. Gameplay is updated in a way that goalkeepers won't be able to easily catch every ball, players will stumble on each other, slip and try to keep balance, be able to simulate fouls and hope they don't get caught by the referee, and so on. This time, the English League has imaginary emblems for unlicensed clubs such as Chelsea, Liverpool, Arsenal and others, certain other clubs still remain with proper insignia. However, their player names and statistics are correct. The same can not be said about a large portion of national selections, which have players with correct statistics, but garbled names and more generic faces.\n\nGameplay is somewhat easier and players won't kick ball so high when you hold the kicking button for too long, and dribbling is corrected and enhanced in comparison to the last game. Modes are as usual: League (English, Italian, Spanish, French, Dutch), Master League, Exhibition, Training, and Edit Mode.\n\nFifty-nine music tracks are provided to assign to play on a specific part of the game (main menu, league menu, stats screen and so on). This is the first game in the series to appear on the PlayStation 3 platform.",

Each environment theme has its own resident \u2018Course Pro\u2019 resplendent in suitably themed fancy dress costume.\n\nThere are 4 single player modes (Career, Tournament, Speed Golf, Practice).  As you progress through the game, you\u2019ll unlock special balls and clubs which enable you to play different types of shots (e.g. chip clubs, swerve clubs, rubber balls, speed balls).  Combinations of these balls and clubs then allow you to approach holes in different ways and attempt various trick shots to try and get a hole in one (which is possible on every hole).\n\nIn multi-player, you can play against up to 3 friends.  The multi-player game features specific pickups which can help you & hinder your opponents as well as a \u2018distraction\u2019 feature which allows non-active players to trigger sound effects & rumble the pad of the player currently taking a shot.\n\nThe game also features a \u2018Pro-Shop\u2019 where buy various gadgets to customise various elements of the game such as the colour of your ball, its trail and even the sound effects it makes when you hit it.",

It is the first 2K Sports American Football game since the NFL and NFLPA licenses were purchased for exclusive use by Electronic Arts.\n\nTo avoid the exclusive license, this title puts a new spin on video game football. Instead of recreating authentic NFL players and teams, it lets you create a team with your favorite Hall of Fame legends. Over 240 retired NFL players have been licensed. All-Pro Football 2K8 ranks players based on their real-life attributes, like great hands or the ability to perform in the clutch. The best players are marked with a gold star. You can also customize your team's name, colors, logo and uniforms.  Once you've created your team, you can play a quick game, a full season in the fictional All-Pro League, or go online. The APL consists of 24 teams grouped into six divisions of four teams each.\n\nThe ruleset drifts between the strictness of Madden series and the freedom of Blitz: The League. Horse-collar tackles and late hits are allowed, but  for the latter players are penalized with a fifteen-yard personal foul.",

      "description": "The 2008 edition in the <i>Smackdown vs. Raw</i> series holds new features to the WWE game franchise. This is the first in the series to include the extremists of ECW, including The Sandman, Marcus Cor Von and CM Punk.\n\nThe game also features a new struggle submission system, new weapon choices including guitars, and eight superstar fighting styles, including Showman, Powerhouse, High-Flyer and more. Each player can now choose a primary and a secondary fighting style. It continues the legend trend and new arenas, such as Wrestlemania 23, Unforgiven and Summerslam as well as the classic superstars like Undertaker, Shawn Michaels and Ric Flair. The roster largely depends on the platform, and some versions include wrestlers not available in the other ones.\n\nThe season and general manager modes of the previous games have been merged into the WWE 24/7 mode (PlayStation, Xbox 360), allowing to create a new superstar, play as an existing one or choose to manage someone. In the Wii version this is called Main Event mode, and it does not contain an option to manage wrestlers. \n\nThere is also a new Tournament mode with various challenges. Some of the features match types are Iron Man, Battle Royal, Hell in a Cell, Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match, Hardcore, Ladder, Elimination Chamber and Royal Rumble. In the Wii version five match types are available: Single (One on One), Tag Team (Two on Two), K.O. Match, Triple Threat and Hardcore. It does not have the WWE Shop and a smaller move list, but includes Mii integration (menu screens and in-game HUD) as well as motion-sensing attacks based on the controls.\n\nThe Xbox 360 versions allows players to use custom music during entrances while the PS3 version offers a first-person view during those sequences. Both are the only ones to offer online multiplayer.",

All 30 teams from MLB and their stadiums are included, as well as their player rosters. The Wii version of this game is controlled by flicking the Wii remote and Nunchuk. These motion controls include drumming the remote and nunchuk when trying to speed up and using the remote as a bat when hitting.\n\nInstead of a traditional season mode as in many other baseball simulations, in <i>The BIGS</i> there is a mode titled Rookie Challenge, where the player creates a ballplayer and tries to lead him and his team to the World Series. Another mode, Home Run Pinball, puts a hitter in the middle of Times Square, New York, with the aim to hit balls into windows and neon lights.",

Sixteen characters over fifteen different Sega game series are represented, as are ten different courts based on those same franchises.\n\nExhibition and Tournament modes are included in the game. The first is a simple vs mode, whereas the tournament allows the player to unlock new characters and courts over a series of matches and other challenges, all related to tennis but also drawing heavily on the video game represented. Singles and doubles can be played by either humans or AI, with the player being able to choose his or her doubles partner.\n\nVersion differences are notable, as the Wii game misses out on online play in exchange for three different control modes utilising the Wii Remote (much like in Wii Sports tennis, the Wii Remote and nunchuck or the Classic Controller. Online play is included in the 360 and PS3 versions.\n\nEach character has a special move to aid them with their tennis match, relating to the character. For example, Beat from Jet Set Radio has a power that allows the ball to grind against the net and shoot off at a random point, making it difficult to return. \n\nMinigames are included as both one-offs and part of the tournament. These include a Target-hitting game, The House of the Dead zombie killing game (hit moving zombies around a court before the timer runs out), a Space Harrier game, a Puyo Puyo game, a Virtua Cop game and a Samba De Amigo-related game.",

      "description": "<i>UEFA Euro 2008</i> is yet another football game from EA Sports. This time it's basically FIFA 08 modified to let the player experience this summer's European Championship. \n\nEuro 2008 lets you control any European national football team in many different ways. For example you can decide to create your own character and play as good as possible on your position on the field in order to become good enough to captain your team. This is basically a slightly modified version of the \"be a pro\"-mode from FIFA 08.\n\nYou can also try different challenges and tournament modes in order to unlock extras or just test your abilities. You can play through the full championship experience, including the qualifying stages, or you can skip ahead to the group stages. You can also play a very extensive challenge mode where you try to make you nation the best in European football by clearing different challenges against all the other European teams. \n\nAs with FIFA 08 the PC and console versions are quite different. In fact, they are based on completely different game engines. While the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3-versions boasts state of the art graphics and a new and improved control system, the PC-version still basically looks and functions like the 2006-version.",

      "description": "Sony's baseball franchise returns for 2007 with updated rosters and classic features, such as season mode, managerial mode along with the classic career mode, but also has some new features as well.\n\nOne of the new features is the Road to the Show, a new take on the career mode that expands last years version.  Instead of playing every player on the team, the game focuses more on the player alone.  It will fast forward to decisions tied to the player (i.e. fielding a ball hit towards your player or batting), but also gives you goals to complete (i.e. knocking in a run or getting on base or trying for a double play while fielding).  Success of these goals will help you establish your place with the manager and team and give you a better chance for a major league start.\n\nIt also features an Adaptive Pitching Intelligence, where the game learns more from your at bats or your pitching, but also has your catchers help you out more by picking signals out instead of just randomly selecting pitches.  Another is umpire personality, where the strike zone is smaller or larger, depending upon the umpire calling the game at the time.\n\nThe all-new New Pitch Command System (PCS) delivers comprehensive strategy to pitch selection, as a pitcher's \"pitch comfort\" will be predetermined based on a best to worst pitch scenario, letting you decide whether to stick with what is working or begin a new pitching regiment.\n\nPS2 and PS3 versions provide online league play, which also lets you check on real-time MLB scores and news while the PSP version also lets you play against others using Wi-Fi connection.\n\nIt features an extensive MLB license, with most of the players with a few exceptions and also features Rex Hudler, Matt Vasgersian and Dave Campbell as color commentators, providing realistic coverage, almost giving it a TV feel along with realistic graphics, giving the players and the action a very realistic feel, such as a pitchers let down after giving up a huge homerun or a team rushing the field to celebrate after hitting a homerun, winning the game.",

      "description": "The third game in the Top Spin series updates the concept of the previous two tennis titles with some new features. The most important change is that more control is given back to the player, levelling the difficulty. In the previous version the AI took control of timing and positing, players only needed to press a button for shots, and keeping it pressed longer made them harder. In this edition the player controls the power of the shot, the positioning of the player and the timing needed to perform a successful swing. When the player needs to run to reach the ball, it will never be as precise as powerful as when already in position. Most of these changes are gradually introduced in the tennis school, where players are trained to become familiar with the new controls.\n\nThere are about twenty professional players, modelled after their real-like counterparts and with signature styles. Famous players such as Roger Federer and Justine Henin are present, along with a few legends such as Boris Becker, Bj\u00f6rn Borg and Monica Seles. Not all legends are available at the same time for all three platforms (including Wii). An editor is included to design custom characters. There are dynamic weather changes and the players' costumes show traces of grass or dirt as the match progresses. In the same vein, the player faces show how they are sweating after playing for some time.\n\nNext to regular matches, there is a full career mode where the player starts with very low statistics. These can be upgraded by training and playing matches, but they can never all be pushed to the maximum. Instead players need to choose to train for some powerful abilities or decide to become a more all-round player. This is mostly reflected in the amount of winners based on forehands or backhands for instance.\n\nAlong with quick matches, the world tour is also supported online. The world ranking starts over every fortnight and is not continued endlessly like the previous version. Some of the tournaments are the US Open, Australian Open en Roland Garros, but Wimbledon has not been included. There are various difficulty levels, six camera modes and the graphics are more detailed than the previous versions.",

      "description": "The official game of the Games of the XXIX Olympiad, <i>Beijing 2008</i> features 32 national teams in 38 events for both men and women on a varied number of disciplines, played in truthful representations of the stadiums that hosted the real Games in the summer of 2008 such as the Birds' Nest or the Watercube.\n\nAs usual with games in this genre (some events play in a particular similar fashion to Athens 2004), button mashing and timing makes up the core of the gameplay, with some exceptions and novel ideas. In now-classic events such as sprinting running and swimming, instead of mashing the power buttons as soon as the starting pistol is heard, the player has to control a bar with the trigger buttons, where the player jumps from the blocks when it is completely filled and has to be careful not to fill the bar too soon (resulting in a false start) or too late (losing precious time). Other events also have their share of gameplay innovations in the genre, such as the Javelin, where the analogue stick is used to set the throw and accurately define the angle accurately. \nIn the most off-beat events, diving and rings requires the player to follow the on-screen cue with the analogue pads, while others such as the the floor exercise and beam require the player to follow the button queues - there are three difficulty levels, mostly changing the looseness of the timing - in higher levels, the player will have a much harder time hitting \"perfect\" moves and some of them will require much faster combinations.\n\nOne of the most novel events is Judo, where the player must react quickly to the on-screen cues in order to gain advantage during the grappling phase - once there's an opening chance for an attack, the player can press one button to initiate a throw, and if the mis-match was large enough (a \"Perfect\" against a \"Very Good\" won't allow for an <i>Ippon</i> throw, and the defending player with block the attack, starting another grappling sequence). The player being thrown must bash the appropriate button to decrease the power bar to avoid being projected with his back down, which would result on an <i>Ippon</i> and instant defeat. While an <i>Ippon</i> decides the match instantly, two <i>Waza-ari</i> also decide, with the lowest scores (<i>Koka</i> and <i>Yuko</i>) usually deciding matches stopped by the clock. The player can also choose to do a choke or lock move, where both players must press the triggers, and unless the defending player does not break the lock in a limited time frame, he concedes an <i>Ippon</i> and loses the match.\nTable Tennis also makes an appearance, and is an event where the player must be properly placed to respond with either a well-timed normal or backspin shot, the timing defining the accuracy of the shot. Good returns fill a power bar, and once it's filled, the player can do a particularly vicious shot that when well executed is nearly impossible to return - however, being able to return these shots becomes the essence of each set, same with doing perfect serves.\n\nGame modes include practice, regular competition (where the player can select or deselect each event, for men and women), random events, Decathlon or Heptathlon and of course, the Olympics. While in previous games the Olympics were usually just a set of events, in <i>Beijing 2008</i> they are much more complex, and feature a game where the player must complete a number of challenges each day with the difficulty level and number of necessary successes increasing progressively. While in the other modes there is a slight slowdown during the technical parts of the events, in Olympic the player must assign points to it, and trigger when required. The player also needs to assign points to other key areas, such as speed, technique or accuracy. Failing to reach the goal for the day forces the player to load the game and try again.",

      "description": "<i>NHL 2K9</i> is 2K Sports' entry into Hockey gaming for the 2008-2009 season. The game is built on the same engine that many of the previous 2K hockey games used, and features include Season, Franchise, 2-on-2 Mini Rink, 4-on-4 Pond Hockey, and Shootout modes. Season Mode allows you to take basic control over an NHL team and guide them through an entire 82-game schedule, as well as (if you're good enough) the playoffs. Franchise is like Season Mode, but much deeper. In it, you guide a team through multiple seasons of hockey, and have control of options like drafting, contract signings, free agency, and hiring staff. The 2-on-2 and 4-on4 modes allow you and a friend to hand-pick a team of players (3 or 5, depending on the mode) and face off in a wide-open, arcade-style hockey game. Shootout works exactly like a shootout in real hockey: three skaters per side alternate taking shots at the goaltender, and most goals wins. Aside from game play modes, you also have the option of creating your own player or your own team from scratch, as well as modifying the existing roster (ie make trades, edit line combination) to your taste.\n\nNHL 2K9 is the first NHL Sports title for the Nintendo Wii. The Wii version features motion controls for shooting, passing, checking, and even fighting. There's also a new system for those who like to take control of the goaltender, which involves mimicking controller movements as they flash up on the screen in order to make saves. \n\nThe PS3 and XBOX 360 version include online play, in which you can jump into a quick game with up to 11 other players, or participate in online leagues or tournaments.\n\nIn the broadcast booth, Bob Cole and Harry Neal have been replaced by the San Jose Sharks' announcing team of Randy Hann and Drew Remenda. The game soundtrack mainly comprised of energetic rock tunes, and features the likes of The Offspring, Bad Religion, and Mastodon.",

      "description": "The first Total Nonstop Action Wrestling game based on the weekly television show of the same name, TNA iMPACT!.\n\nEnter the six-sided ring as you take control of one of 25 TNA stars such as Kurt Angle, Jeff Jarrett, Rhino, Samoa Joe, AJ Styles, Sting, and Christian Cage. Each wrestler comes alive thanks to their participation in motion capturing and allowing actual scans of themselves to be used for the game in place of hand-painted textures for extra realism and detail.\n\nTNA iMPACT tries to revive the older arcade style of wrestling game and is more about fast paced action while still offering multiple match types such as Standard, Tag Team, Free For All, Ultimate X, Submission, Handicap, and Falls Count anywhere. In addition to this you can play alone, or compete against your friends at home, or online\n\nThere is also a story mode in which you create your very own TNA wrestler with customisable costumes, move sets and such as you unfold the back-story of a former champion wrestler.\n\n(unfortunately due to limitations with the PS2 and Wii create-a-wrestler and online functions are not available)",

Once again the player will hire and release players, along with assistant coaches and various office personnel as well as edit plays to be used by their team.\n\nGames are once again played out in real time, but the player has no control of their team, instead they coach their players, telling them what runs to play as well as make game breaking decisions such as going for the win on 4th and goal with only a few seconds on the clock or faking a field goal and going for two points to win rather than tie the game.  Players can also control their team in the offseason, tracking future players in the <i>NFL Draft</i>.\n\nPlayers can also go online and share their playbook for others to view as well as compete head-to-head, coaching their team against their opponents.",

Players can also use the right analog stick for defensive purposes, locking onto opponents and run defensive plays against them.  There is also Signature Style, giving the NBA players in the game and more life-like and fluid feel to them.\n\nThere is also a Slam Dunk Contest sponsored by Sprite with the ability to use over 300 different dunk variations as well as compete against four other opponents online.

If a winner is not decided after three rounds, the game goes into 'Sudden Death' mode, and the first person to KO wins.  The game also has a difficult to perform 'Facebreaker' move - if you perform this move on your opponent, you instantly win the match.\n\nYou can throw low punches and high punches, grab your opponent, or perform a strong attack.  By repeatedly attacking with low or high punches, you'll build up your 'Breaker Meter'.  If you hit with a strong attack when the Breaker Meter is filled, you'll perform a Hay, Bone, Ground, Sky or Facebreaker - depending on how full it is.  You can also use the shoulder button to block.  If you block and use your low or high punch before your opponent hits you, you'll perform a Parry, which counters their oncoming attack.\n\nThe game also allows you to custom-create your own boxers.  You can do this either just by using the game's editor on its own, or, if you have a camera, you can take a photo and the editor can use that as a starting point for your fighter.  You can even upload and download other custom-created boxers to see other people's creations!",

It sports updated offensive and defensive A.I. and features <i>Team Unity</i> where the chemistry of the team combined with the captain's leadership qualities can combine to help their team in their performance and morale on the court.\n\nPlayers can also customize by creating their own school along with uniforms and even design a unique stadium for their created school.  The games are almost identical except for a few differences: the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions has the ability to create their own chants for their crowds to yell during home games and the PS3 utilizes the SIXAXIS controller to shoot free throws by tilting it.",

This mode is also available in multiplayer for up to 12 players in 6-on-6-matches in which every player on the ice is controlled by a human.\n\nThe defensive stick control has also been revamped and now allows for example to prevent direct passes. And it's possible to control both puck and stick with one hand in the offensive, allowing the player to better outplay the goalie. Of course all this complicates the already complex controls even more so that now it's possible to switch to the control scheme from NHL '94 which only needs a few buttons and one analog stick to be successful.",

This game features improvements on the tag team action, including a new Hot-Tag mode, tag team finishers, and new actions to help in the match.\n\nAs with the previous game, the roster includes over 60 superstars from Smackdown, Raw and ECW. To keep the roster up-to-date, the game includes a roster editor allowing players to change the superstars on it, as well as change their appearance from face to heel. However, this is also the first game in the <i>Smackdown</i> series since Here Comes the Pain not to feature any legends.\n\nAnother new feature is Create-a-Finisher, which allows players to create their own unique finishing move out of over 500 different animations. These can also be shared online during online matches.\n\nThe game includes two different story modes: Road to Wrestlemania and Career mode. Road to Wrestlemania mode allows the player to experience six unique stories involving the wrestlers Triple H, CM Punk, Chris Jericho, The Undertaker, John Cena, and a co-op storyline featuring Batista and Rey Mysterio. Career mode is the replacement of GM Mode from previous games. This mode allows the player to make a career for superstars and upgrade custom wrestlers.\n\nOther features include the Highlight Reel, which lets the player create videos from his matches, new Inferno and Gauntlet matches, as well as new positions in the backstage brawl.",

Injuries are still present with enhanced and realistic graphics showing broken bones and tearing tissue through x-rays of the players bodies at the moment of impact.\n\nOne new feature is the ability to pin point the location of an opposing players body they wish to hit, the larger the area the greater the chances they will hit, but the smaller will have the player use precision timing but will have greater results in creating a devastating injury.\n\nThere is also online capabilities where players can connect through their respective service in quick versus matches against friends or engage in an online campaign-mode as well as downloadable content.  NFL Legend Lawrence Taylor once again makes an appearance as Quentin Sands, the New York Nightmares devastating linebacker, along with many other retired NFL stars who provide their voice talents to the experience.  Also lending their voices are comedians Jay Mohr and Frank Caliendo (who is most notable for his impressions including John Madden).",

But before the player can go on the slope, he has to create his character by choosing not only from different body looks but also from different clothes and snowboards.\n\nDuring the course of the game the player earns money by completing the challenges which can in return be invested in more stylized clothes and additional types of snowboards. Each of the boards has six stats like balance or speed and not all of them are the best possible option for every given situation. While in a race speed is an important factor, a board with a higher rating in rotation allows for better stunts.\n\nThe game puts the player in an open world with him free to roam around the slope as he pleases. Several lifts and even a helicopter bring him to different starting locations but if he wants, he can also walk and discover hidden areas by doing so. By doing tricks, with controls using mainly the analog sticks similar to Skate, the player earns respect points. And on the track are, besides many obstacles to perform tricks on, challenges like the Jibfest, in which only tricks on rails and boxes count or Freestyle in which every trick counts. Others include the Death Race, in which the player needs to get to the goal before everyone else but as the name suggests, everything is allowed including ramming opponents and throwing snowballs to get them off-balance. There are also some challenges like King of the Hill that can only be done with at least one other human player joining in.\n\nThe multiplayer mode is basically an extension of the single player experience. Everything that is available in single player, can also be done with other players online or over LAN.

Additionally, there are two main modes of play where in the single player mode the player will compete in a fifteen-team tournament or go head-to-head against a friend in a multiplayer mode.\n\nThe standard rules of baseball still apply, but it adds power-ups that the player can pick up and use during the game, such as the ability for their pitcher to throw faster or their batter to hit better.  They can also substitute a player during the game, but are limited to three substitutions per game. The game is shown through 2D graphics with comic-style cutscenes to illustrate the action, such as dramatic catches and home runs that will pop-up during the game.",

It has new features such as the ability to boost skill performance and increase overall ratings by making user-controlled plays that elevate the team's motivation levels.  As a coach, you can make promises to recruits to gain commitments and depending on whether or not you keep those promises, your coaching integrity rating will rise or fall causing players to transfer.  The game has many college specific features such as home field advantage, composure ratings, an all-new fatigue system, and new trick plays like the Statue of Liberty and Hook and Ladder.  You can revisit your top accomplishments in My Shrine, your personal Hall of Fame that stores trophies, custom photos, and video highlights.  There is a Campus Legend Mode where you can develop a player from a star high school player to a backup college player.",

The player spends much time exploring the wilderness looking for traces of prey. Because they can be hard to make out, a Hunter's Sense is included to reduce the world to grayscales and make animals stand out. The game however maintains an arcade approach and lets the player shoot everything in his way, without regard for a patient approach.\n\nThe game's Career mode has timed levels forcing quick gameplay, and the different stages are set all around the world. When facing larger animals such as bear or lions, a Hand-to-Claw Combat mode is often triggered automatically to fend them off through a number of quick time event key presses. Another option is the Adrenaline mode where time comes almost completely to a stop, making it easier to line up the shots and get a lot of kills.\n\nDifferent types of equipment become available to assist in the hunt, and in certain missions it is not required to kill animals \u2013 tranquillizing them is sufficient.",

But when you went for the biggest shot of your life, you got jacked by the cops and put in jail. Now, on the day of your release, you're heading back to the streets of San Vanelona to make a name for yourself once again. With the help of familiar faces like Slappy, Mikey, and Sammy, you'll make your way back to the top and to the magazine covers once again.\n\n<i>skate 2</i> is the sequel to the breakout skateboarding hit from Electronic Arts. All the familiar elements of the previous game have been brought back and refined. The flickit controls have been improved, and many new tricks have been added. There are still two career paths, Thrasher and Skateboard Mag, and staples of the previous game like Own the Spot and skate.reel have also returned.\n\nNew is the addition of an advance bail system, where you are graded on how stylishly you can hurt yourself, as well as the ability to step off the board and move objects around. You can even create and share your own spots made from movable objects.",

      "description": "<i>Virtua Tennis 2009</i> features several international tennis stars like Roger Federer, Boris Becker or Maria Sharapova against which the player needs to compete against or play with in the heart of the game: The World Tour. The player creates his own character from scratch and plays to reach the number one rank on the world ranking list.\n\nAs its predecessor Virtua Tennis 3, <i>Virtua Tennis 2009</i> is not a hardcore simulation of the sport and only needs three buttons to perform all possible shots. Still time needs to be invested in training the character through practice matches, specific training sessions at the Tennis Academy and 12 different kinds of mini-games. These include \"Pirate Wars\" which requires the player to hit and sink moving pirate ships and \"Shopping Dash\" where the player needs to collect items on the tennis floor while avoiding balls thrown at him. These mini-games, as well as the normal singles and double matches can also be played with/against friends.\n\nIn the World Tour mode, the player can only take one action per week. He can only play in a tournament or do one of the mini-games but not both for example. In addition he has to watch his stamina level which decreases more or less every time he plays a match or does a training session. This means form time to time it is necessary to sit out a week or two and go on a vacation, returning fully rested. By winning tournaments the player also earns money that can be invested in different sports gear and clothes.",

      "description": "Fight Night Round 4 is (as the name would suggest) Electronic Arts' 4th entry into the boxing series. This time around, you have over 40 athletes to choose from from a variety of eras and weight classes, including Evander Holyfield, Floyd Mayweather, and (most notably) Mike Tyson and Mohammad Ali. \n\nIn addition to the default selection of fighters, you can make your own customized fighter using a powerful set of creation tools. The most impressive among these tools is the ability to use a PS3 camera or EA Sports' own website to upload pictures of yourself (or anyone, really) which will then be used to create a customized 3D head for your created boxer. \n\nThese custom-built fighters can then be taken into the game's \"Legacy Mode\", which starts you out as a 19-year old amateur looking to make a name for himself in the boxing world. You will partake in numerous fights spanning your entire career, improving through the use of mini games between matches. You can win several different championships, and then try to defend your title(s) against other emerging boxers. Once your fighter retires, he can then be selected in the exhibition mode to fight any of the default boxers in the game. How effective your fighter once he's added to the selectable roster is entirely based on how many special challenges you complete during his career -- things such as maintaining a 95% win percentage or holding three titles at the same time.\n\nFight Night Round 4 also features an online world championship, which will rank you against every other player in the world in the same weight class as your fighter. Wins and losses are kept track of in this mode.\n\n",
