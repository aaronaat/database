      "description": "This text-based adventure (with some background graphics) was originally released in Japan over the Satellaview system. The game is a spin-off from the Chrono series, and is the precursor to Chrono Cross. Its main characters and plot elements are very close to those of <i>Chrono Cross</i>; it tells the story of Serge (travelling musician), Kid (thief), and Magil (wizard) as they attempt to steal the Frozen Flame from Viper Manor. The game contains multiple, often humorous endings. \n\nGameplay is something between a standard text adventure and a visual novel. Rather than having a full array of possible actions, players are limited to the several options it presents at any time.  With newly discovered items and information, new areas can be reached.  Occasionally battles will occur during the exploration, which are also handled by displaying several possible actions to choose between, such as \"Run\" or \"Jump back as it swings!\"",

      "description": "This is an adventure game based on the old Japanese fairy tale about Momotaro, a boy who was found by an old couple inside of a huge peach (hence the name Momotaro - \"Peach Guy\"). Momotaro grows up and embarks on a journey to rid the land of the vicious tribe of ogres, and to take their treasures. On his way he meets three animals - a dog, a monkey, and a pheasant, who help him to defeat the ogres. This game is the first part of the story, and is divided into two large chapters, the first telling the story of the dog Ringo, the second the story of the monkey Matsunosuke. \r\n\r\nIn this adventure, you interact with the world by selecting various commands from a menu. Along with traditional commands such as \"Look\" or \"Take\" there are situation-specific commands, for example \"Smell\" for the dog. In certain places it is possible to move by navigating the character physically.",

You are a high-school student, whose father is a famous archaeologist traveling around the world, and whose mother died when he was a child. It is now your third year at the 88 High School, and naturally, your primary concern is your love life. Will you be able to date successfully and to come to a happy ending with one of the fifteen lovely female classmates?\n\nThe game mechanics are a lot like in a \"standard\" adventure game (examine objects, visit various locations, talk to people, make decisions), but the plot centers exclusively around your relationship with the girls. The game has its own internal clock. You can move around your character on a \"city map\", visiting different locations. Every visit takes 20-30 minutes of game time. You can make appointments and visit various places at a specific time. The decisions you make influence the story.",

While the gameplay is similar (exploring levels to collect clues and solve the mystery), there are four different episodes for this version.  While visiting the Drabwell Ranch, ghost's interrupt the festivities and the gang must find out who is behind the hauntings and why.  Another adventure takes the gang to Deadman's Cove where a ghostly pirate has been scaring off tourists and it is up to Scooby and the Gang to bring it to a halt. The other two mysteries take place at a fun fair and a haunted mansion.\n\nPlayers can use Scooby's unique sniffing ability to find clues. Scooby also consume Scooby Snacks to reduce the fright meter.  Additionally there are a series of mini-games that player can participate in such as \"Wac-A-Monster\" or \"Make a Scooby Sandwich\".  The graphics are faithfully recreated to resemble the long-running Hanna Barbara series.",

      "description": "In every sector of the Cosmos, there is a queen who rules over it, keeping the powers of the elements in balance with the help of the Nine Guardians. But with time, the queen's power fades, and a new queen must replace her. Several candidates compete until one of them proves that she has the knowledge of the nine elements and has convinced the Guardians to lend their power to her. The heroine of the game is a seventeen-year-old Angelique Limoges, and her main adversary is a rather unpleasant girl named Rosalia. Will Angelique be able to befriend the Guardians and become the next queen?\n\n<i>Angelique</i> borrows elements from different genres: Japanese-style adventure (without puzzles), \"dating sim\", and (not overly complex) strategy. The goal is to make sure that Angelique has good relationship with the Guardians, maintaining the balance. For that, Angelique has to visit them daily, talk to them, and see what effects their powers have over the land. The situation is further complicated by the fact that Angelique - depending on the Zodiac sign the player chooses for her - has a certain affinity with one of the elements, and therefore, with one of the Guardians. This can lead to a love relationship, which will forfeit Angelique's chances to become a queen, but deliver an ending which can still be considered satisfying. ",

If they are too slow in collecting clues, additional murders will be committed, and will eventually result in a horror movie-like ending. The goal is to complete the story and get a certain number of endings. When this happens, two more stories are unlocked. Getting every possible ending of all three stories will unlock two more stories, these being self-parodies. Completing these unlocks one final feature, a parody of Torneko no Daib\u014dken: Fushigi no Dungeon. None of the stories are related to each other in any way, but they all feature the same characters.\n\nThe gameplay mostly consists of still pictures with text covering the whole screen, which must be read. The player must make choices, including the choice of pointing out who the murderer is. Clues are often misleading, and the true clues are often well-hidden in nonsensical places, like ridiculous dialogue.",
