      "description": "One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980's, <em>Pac-Man</em> stars a little, yellow dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board.\n\nPac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde).  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man.\n\nPac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze.  During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points.  This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghosts' eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.\n\nSurvive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.",

Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase you around. The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. (if you start to inflate them but stop doing so, the monsters will get turned back to their normal selves). Furthermore, rocks are scattered throughout the earth, and you can use these rocks to squash them. If the monsters do not find you for several seconds, they will eventually get turned into ghosts, which are able to walk through the earth. They are invincible and cannot be killed. From time to time, vegetables will appear in the center, and you can get these for points.\n ",

      "description": "In <i>Centipede</i>, the player is trapped in the Enchanted Forest. Armed with only a magic wand to ward off the forest's insect denizens, all of which apparently are attacking in the player in continuous waves. \n\nThe player must use the magic wand to shoot sparks at approaching insects to score points by pressing the controller button. Holding down the controller button will set the wand to rapid fire shots. If the player is bitten by an insect, the player will be temporarily paralyzed and lose one of the three starting magic wands. \n\n<b>Insect Opponents and Mushrooms</b><br>\nAll enemy insects have a distinctive sound before attacking, which may help the player identify which insect is attacking. Enemies and objects in the game are as the following:\n<ul>\n<li><b>The Centipede</b><br>\nThe Centipede will attack in 12 waves. In the first wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 11 body segments. In the second wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 10 body segments, in addition to a detached head. The third wave will have the Centipede with an attached head, 9 body segments, plus two detached heads. These body segments will transform into heads and continue to do so until Wave 12. In the last wave, the Centipede will have 12 detached heads, independently attacking the player. Centipede heads are worth more points than body segments.\n\nAttacks from the Centipede will come from the top of the screen, moving downward. If a spark hits any part of the Centipede, that particular body segment will transform into a mushroom, while the body segment behind it will become the new Centipede head. When the Centipede is destroyed, it will briefly disappear and re-appear from the top of the screen again.\n\n<li><b>The Spider</b><br>\nThe Spider will attempt to distract the player from attacking the Centipede. It will destroy any mushroom it touches. Spiders will score more points if it is hit in closer distances.\n\n<li><b>The Flea</b><br>\nThe Flea will appear if the player has destroyed most of the existing mushrooms. It will drop down creating a new batch of mushrooms where it falls. The Flea will disappear after two hits. After the first hit, the Flea will drop down much faster.\n\n<li><b>The Scorpion</b><br>\nThe Scorpion will appear in the third wave. It moves slowly but will pick up speed, moving faster. While doing so, it will poison any mushroom it touches.\n\n<li><b>Mushrooms</b><br>\nMushrooms fill the Enchanted Forest and may act as obstacles or cover for the player, with added effects to enemy insects. It takes four shots to completly destroy a mushroom. There are two types of mushrooms: Magic Mushrooms and Poisonous mushrooms. Magic mushrooms are the default mushrooms in the game and are also the result of the player destroying an insect or Centipede body segment. Poisonous Mushrooms are the result of the Scorpion touching a mushroom. Poisonous Mushrooms will prompt the Centipede near it to move straight towards the player through any mushroom. Losing a wand will restore any partially damaged mushroom.\n</li></ul><br>\n<b>Game Difficulty and Variations</b><br>\nThe game offers four difficulty levels: Novice, Standard, Advanced, and Expert. Game Variations are as the following:\n<ul>\n<li>One Player\n<li>Two Player Alternating<br>\nTwo players will take turns when the active player is bitten.\n<li>Dual Player Competition<br>\nTwo players will appear on the screen at the same time. Scoring is separate. Shots fired from one player will paralyze the other player.\n<li>Team Play\nTwo players will appear on the screen at the same time. Scoring is combined. Shots fired from one player will not paralyze the other player.\n</li></ul><br>\n<b>Scoring</b><br>\nThe player will win a bonus magic wand for every 12,000 points to a maximum of six wands. The game will end when all wands are lost. Scoring are as the following:\n<ul><li>Centipede Head - 100 points\n<li>Centipede Body Segment - 10 points\n<li>Spider at close range - 900 points\n<li>Spider at medium range - 600 points\n<li>Flea - 200 points\n<li>Scorpion - 1,000 points\n<li>Restored mushroom - 5 points\n<li>Destroyed mushroom - 1 points</li></ul>",

      "description": "Following an on-going war with the alien Ur-Quan race, the Alliance has lost. The Ur-Quan armada systematically hunts down the alliance races and imprisons them onto their homeworlds. However, unknown to the Ur-Quan, a small research vessel had been lost during the war while sent to a distant star system looking for evidence of the ancient Precursor race. The survivors of this research team had come across the controls to a Starship factory and used it to build a Precursor supply vessel, one of the largest vessels in the galaxy.\n\nUpon return, the captain of the ship discovers, to his dismay, that Earth has become one of Ur-Quan's slave planets. The surface of Earth is glowing red, devoid of life, and a few humans are locked in a starbase orbiting the planet. The captain contacts the starbase commander and finds out that the only way to defeat the Ur-Quan is to convince other races populating the galaxy to join them in their struggle.\n\n<i>Star Control II</i> is a hybrid game based on exploration, space combat, and ship customization. Unlike its predecessor, it has a heavily plot-driven, quest-based structure reminiscent of role-playing or adventure games. The game's main focus is on exploring a vast galaxy consisting of numerous star systems and interacting with various alien species populating it. Each species has their own personal traits and would usually require the player to exploit conversation trees or perform different tasks to convince them to join. The main objective is to gather as many allies as possible, though only a few alliances are required to complete the game. \n\nWhile in deep space, the starship can approach any star it comes across, and then the player can guide the ship around its system and land on its planets and their moons. Space is treated as two-dimensional and presented in a top-down view. There is also a starmap available which shows the entire galaxy and allows the player to set the ship on auto-pilot to any star. \n\nThroughout space are different alien civilizations. These are represented on the starmap by a sphere of influence. Within the sphere, the aliens have a controlling presence and their ships will venture freely. Outside the sphere, encounters are rarer. Aliens can be dealt with diplomatically, through a series of dialog options, or engaged in combat.\n\nAlongside the main plot objective, the player also configures and upgrades his fleet in a role-playing fashion. The main starship is the Precursor vessel and it can be used to travel between star systems, which uses up fuel. Raw materials are used as currency to make purchases in the starbase. It is possible to buy fuel, as well as improve the player-controlled fleet in various ways. These include purchasing smaller ships to accompany the main one on its travels and participate in combat; hiring crew members, which effectively act as the hit points of the ships; and upgrading the main ship with enhancements that improve its speed, maneuverability, and combat efficiency. Successfully completing a quest for an alien race may also result in their combat ships joining the fleet.\n\nRaw materials are found on surfaces of planets and moons throughout the galaxy. The player has to send a landing module to the planet and then guide it around the surface as it picks up materials found earlier with a scanner. Each planet is unique in the type of minerals and metals it is formed of. Some planets are plagued by natural dangers such as lightning storms, earthquakes or lava, which can damage or destroy landing modules. Non-sentient lifeforms can also be found and stunned to obtain biological samples. Special installations, objects and ruins can also be found on certain planets and explored. \n\nCombat is action-based and utilizes the same engine as the first game, where action is controlled from a top view and influenced by the gravity of nearby planets. Each alien vessel has unique abilities, and the player can select any ship from his fleet to participate in battles, attempting to find the best combination against specific enemies. Combat can also be played as a standalone game (melee mode), separate from the main storyline. It can also be set on a cyborg mode within the main game, allowing the computer AI to take over the battles and calculate their results depending on the attributes of the ships.",

      "description": "<i>Popcorn</i> is a  Breakout-style game. The goal is to destroy bricks with a ball that bounces off a paddle the player controls. The layout of the bricks is different in each level. Some bricks are indestructible, forming areas that can \"trap\" your ball or force it to bounce off in a sharp movement, making it more difficult to hit it with the paddle. Other bricks take several hits to break. There are also enemies which float around the bricks and will deliberately redirect the ball. The player has a certain amount of lives; each time the player lets the ball fall off the screen, a life is lost.\n\nThere is a variety of upgrades (letters that fall down when the player breaks certain bricks) to use in this game. Those upgrades are:<ul>\n<li>E - The paddle is extended</li>\n<li>L - The paddle can shoot lasers at bricks and enemies</li>\n<li>C - Glue is poured over the paddle, allowing the player to catch it</li>\n<li>T - A ball will split into three. This happens even if you already have three balls onscreen.</li>\n<li>V - The player gains an extra life</li>\n<li>S - The ball slows down</li>\n<li>M - All the enemies stop their movement</li>\n<li>F - A floor appears that prevents the ball from falling off the screen</li>\n<li>I - The ball impacts an invisible wall, sending it into the opposite direction</li>\n<li>+ - The player is immediately transported to the next level</li>\n<li>R - Any power-ups the player has are removed.</li>\n</ul>\nAn editor is included which allows the player to create their own levels.",

Earth has been invaded, and you and your tank lead the defensive effort. You drive around the battlefield from a first-person view, targeting and firing at tanks, planes and UFOs. You have a radar to help you see where the enemies are in direction and distance. Objects can be used as strategic cover. Controls simulate the tracks of a tank realistically, so the direction and speed settings are varied - combining forward right and backward left movements (as you can on keyboard versions) sees you change direction more quickly.",

      "description": "For years, the Toy-Volt company has been producing toys and games for children all over the world. Within months of introducing their first products, Toy-Volt shot to the top! No one could put their finger on exactly what it was that made the toys so popular. Sure, they employed the best designers and marketers in the world, but there was something else about Toy-Volt toys, something almost.... magic. Now, their newest R/C cars really start to live! \n\n<i>Re-Volt</i> is a racing game where you take control over one of more than 28 R/C cars and drive on one of the 13 tracks. The tracks are varied, and include a toy shop, a supermarket, a luxury liner and more. It is possible to play a \"reversed\" (backwards) or \"mirror\" (reversed left and right) variety of each track. There are also 4 levels of realism to choose from. \n\nThere are a couple of single- and multiplayer game modes to choose from. There's a Single Race, where you complete a single track while competing with several computer-controlled opponents; a Championship, where you try to complete a series of races in hopes of finishing on the top; and Multiplayer, where you play with live opponents. There's also a Time Trial, where you're alone on the track, and simply try to get as best a time as possible; a Practice mode, where you're free to drive around a track to learn its structure and shortcuts; and the Stunt Arena, where you drive around a special arena and try to collect stars situated in hard-to-reach places. \n\nIn Single Race, Championship and Multiplayer there are power-ups scattered throughout the track; picking them up gives you a one-use random power, such as missiles to launch at pesky opponents, a star to temporarily freeze competitors in place or a lightning bolt, which makes your car shock opponents nearby to make them stop.

      "description": "Originating in the arcades, this is a full-motion video rail shooter with real actors, produced by the makers of Mad Dog McCree.\n\n<i>Crime Patrol</i> puts the player in the shoes of a police officer, who starts as a Rookie and has to work his way up to become a member of SWAT and eventually the Delta Force team. To do that, he has to complete missions, which involve taking down criminals in a variety of locations. Beginning with smaller-scale criminals (such as shoplifters), the hero will later have to face gangsters, drug lords, and eventually terrorists. For each set of missions, the player characters is being teamed up with another police officer. The gameplay is quite similar to any other of the large live-action laser-gun games found in the arcades - all the player has to do is take the gun (or the mouse in the computer version) and show those criminals who's the boss!",

It features smooth scrolling VGA graphics, a variety of enemies on ground, air and sea, and an original soundtrack.\n\nAfter completing each level you have the option of upgrading your ship with a powerful arsenal of weapons and goodies. Some weapons are effective on only ground or air targets, while some are on both. There are some really advanced weapons like the auto-track mini-gun which can effectively destroy almost any kind of targets without aiming the ship.\n\nDying in shoot'em ups can be annoying, especially if you have to start all over the beginning. However, in Raptor you can save your game between each level. If you have enough credit you can even buy multiple shields for further protection.\n\nThe 2010 edition of <i>Raptor: Call of the Shadows</i> includes improved graphics and native support for higher resolutions (640x400, 960x600 and 1280x800). Standard graphics are also available. ",

      "description": "In 1981, a sequel to Pac-Man was introduced in the form of his girlfriend, <i>Ms. Pac-Man</i>.  This sequel continued on the \"eat the dots/avoid the ghosts\" gameplay of the original game, but added new features to keep the title fresh.\n\nLike her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit  while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics.  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.\n\nMs. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.\n\nSurvive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of \"Junior\".",

In order to revive his Queen Sindel, the emperor Shao Kahn used the Outworld Tournament from Mortal Kombat 2 as a diversion while his Shadow Priests revive his fallen Queen on Earth. Once enacted, the dimensional bridge between the two realms connects, allowing Kahn's extermination squads to invade and destroy Earth, and enslave the population's souls.\n\nA small team of Raiden's \"Chosen Warriors\" survives the attack: Mortal Kombat champion Liu Kang and his ally Kung Lao, Special Forces agents Sonya Blade and Jax, the shaman Nightwolf, the riot cop Stryker, the nomadic Kabal, and former Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero, who has gone rogue from his clan. Facing the warriors are the mercenary Kano, cyber-ninjas Smoke, Sektor and Cyrax, Sheeva, a female Shokan, the sorcerer Shang Tsung, and Queen Sindel herself.\n\n<i>Mortal Kombat 3</i> brings new elements to the 2D fighting series: multi-level playfields, \"Dial-A-Combo\" attacks, a \"Run\" button to speed up the battles, and \"Vs.\" codes, which unlock new powers and abilities once both players enter a code sequence in pre-match-up screens. Also included are more stage fatalities and finishing moves as each warrior attempts to go one-on-one with the Centaurian enforcer Motaro, and Shao Kahn himself.\n\nMortal Kombat 3 is the last traditional one-on-one fighting game game in the series to feature motion-captured digitized graphics for its kombatants, and introduces online network play to the PC version.",

      "description": "Unlike Activision's earlier remake of an Atari arcade classic, Battlezone, this one stays close to its namesake.  Take the original, Atari coin-op game Asteroids, add in the features of the Atari 2600 cartridge, then give it 3-D graphics and a bunch of power-ups, and you've got Activision's Asteroids remake.\r\n\r\nYou are an employee of the Astro-Mining Corporation.  Your mission is to simply go to an assigned area of space and clear the area of asteroids and the occassional debris.  The game consists of five zones, each with a different background and some with special features.  Each zone has 15 levels.  In addition to the standard asteroids, there are also mined asteroids that explode; indestructible asteroids that are, well, indestructible; fireball comets; crystal asteroids that regenerate; alien egg asteroids containing deadly baby space worms; and ancient energy asteroids that shoot back!  And there's plenty of enemies in addition to the asteroids, such as Standard and Super Saucers, Asteroids Tugs, Fuel Transports, Hexes, Nuke Drivers, and Vulturoids.\r\n\r\nThere are three types of ships to choose from, each with different strengths and weaknesses.  There are also three skill levels.  If you beat the game at Expert or higher, you gain access to a fourth type of ship.  All ships features the standard laser, shield, flip (instantly flips your ship 180 degrees), and hyperspace.  There are also limited power-ups you can  pick up such as GunSat, Mines, Homing Missiles, Plasma Drill, and Trigger Bombs.\r\n\r\nThe game supports either one or two players.  In two player mode, the object is to simply outscore your opponent in a random zone and level.  You cannot directly kill your opponent by shooting him, but there are other ways....\r\n\r\nLastly, if you shoot the classic-style asteroid in level 15 of the first zone, you'll find the option of \"Classic Asteroids\" now appearing on the main menu.",

Now, over 20 years later, a new Tank has been created based on the technology recovered during the 1978 invasion.  And none too soon, because the Invaders are back!\n\nSpace Invaders is yet another classic arcade game remake by Activision (see Battlezone  and Asteroids).  But this time, Activision licensed a game from Taito instead of Atari.  The game stays close to its roots while adding many power-ups and enemies.\n\nYou can play either one or two players against the Invaders, who march down the screen in orderly rows and columns, at one of three skill levels.  You'll start at Pluto and work your way through the Solar System to Mars, then Venus, and finally Earth.  There are four common aliens (red, green, blue, and yellow), plus seven more less common ones.  You receive special one shot power-ups by shooting four of the same type of Invaders in a row.  As in the original game, there are also Mother Ships that fly above the action, but in this version if you hit them you can pick up other useful power-ups like shields or double shots.  Plus, after fighting off several waves on each planet, you'll face a unique boss.  If you manage to finish the game, you'll be able to play a reproduction of the original coin-op.",

      "description": "In the third major installment of Electronic Arts'\nArcade racing series, there are several modes of play available. You have the standard race, with one big difference - now there are traffic cops out to ticket you for your excessive speed. Alternatively, you can take your turn with the radar gun and attempt to pull over speeding computer or human racers. \n\nReturning to the flavour of the original Need for Speed, this adds a new Pursuit mode, where you must out run the cops through fast, open area tracks, while also out-lasting the rest of the pack. Another new mode is knockout, where you race through all the tracks, and whoever is last after each race is knocked out. The winner is, of course, the one that lasts the distance. Almost every course in the game has one or more shortcuts. \n\nThe cars include Ferrari 550 Maranello, Ferrari 355 F1 Spider, Italdesign Scighera, Lamborghini Diablo SV, Lamborghini Countach, Jaguar XJR-15, Jaguar XK8, Aston Martin DB7, '98 Corvette C5, Mercedes SL600 and the Mercedes CLK GTR.",

      "description": "<i>Die Hard Trilogy</i> lets players guide New York cop John McClane through three arcade-style games based on each of the three <i>Die Hard</i> movies.  Each movie is represented through a totally different style, making this a \"3 games in 1\" style package. \n\n<b>Die Hard</b> is a third person action/adventure through thirty floors of the Nakatomi Tower high-rise. Terrorists have interrupted the company's Christmas party and taken hostages.  As McClane, the player must search for hostages through computer, construction, maintenance, and executive levels. McClane's default pistol holds infinite ammo, and the player can collect limited-ammo machine guns and grenades inside the levels. Walls turn transparent when they intersect the camera, allowing players to follow McClane through hallways and rooms with ease. After all the hostages on a level have been rescued, the player has 30 seconds to locate a bomb sent down by elevator, then use that elevator to move to the next level. \n\n<b>Die Hard 2: Die Harder</b> is a first-person arcade gun game, nearly identical to Virtua Cop. Terrorists have attacked Washington/Dulles Airport. The player automatically moves through the airport and surrounding areas \"on rails,\" shooting bad guys that appear from behind the scenery.  Weapon upgrade icons can be shot to be collected, and either use limited ammo, or are retained until the player is hit (identical to Lethal Enforcers). Players can also destroy parts of the environment by shooting it, which can be used to take out nearby terrorists (with explosions, or by shooting overhead items to drop on them).  This game supports pad controls, or any of the PlayStation's gun controllers.  \n\n<b>Die Hard With A Vengeance</b> has players racing through New York City streets in a variety of vehicles, trying to locate bombs before they explode.  A strict timer ticks off the next explosion, and the player is guided only by a direction arrow and the vocal suggestions of their co-driver. Bombs are hidden inside everyday objects (like phone booths and benches) and are defused by ramming them, which activates the timer on the next bomb. Occasional \"bomb cars\" must be chased and rammed until their life bar is depleted. Powerups can be collected by running over icons in the streets, and include extra time, turbo boosts, and jumps to rocket over obstacles.\n\nAll three games are exaggeratedly bloody (players can run over pedestrians in Die Hard 3 and wipe the blood away with windshield wipers). Each of the three games also uses a combination of textured polygons and sprites to generate their worlds, resulting in warping textures and some quirky \"paper doll\" effects.",

      "description": "Following his successes for the Rebel Alliance in the previous game, the adventures of the starfighter pilot \"Rookie One\" continue. While out scouting in the Dreighton Nebula, Rookie One's patrols receive a distress call from a freighter. As this is an area where ships are known to disappear, any deviation from the flight path is dangerous. But what they find is an Imperial presence where there shouldn't be one... and a new secret project to bring about the destruction of the Rebel Alliance.\n\n<i>Rebel Assault II</i> is a rail-shooter \"interactive movie\" featuring a variety of action sequences. Rookie One will fly sequences in an X-Wing, the Millennium Falcon, speeder bikes and being on foot. His only real ability is the precise targeting and shooting of laser weapon and occasionally the chance to take cover and avoid obstacles. Rookie One will team up with other characters who will aid him and need to be defended in turn. Occasionally different paths can be chosen in the animation and different events triggered, but for the most part the game is a closed environment.",

      "description": "The Post-Terran Minerals Corporation (PTMC) digs up minerals on all nine planets of the solar system, employing humans and robots to do its job. Unfortunately, the mining robots are now being controlled by a hacker, and have taken the human workers hostage. The PTMC has tried to get the robots back under their control, but communication with the mining stations has been lost. In desperation, the PTMC modifies a Pyro-GX ship for combat and hires a mercenary, codenamed \"Material Defender\", to fly it. The mission is to destroy the infected mines and rescue human hostages, destroying any hostile robot that gets in the way.\n\n<i>Descent</i> is a 3D first-person game that puts the player at the controls of the Pyro-GX spaceship. <i>Descent</i> is notable in that the player travels through various interior locations (mines) but can do so in 720 degrees of movement. The ship however only moves forward and backward in any of the directions it is facing. The ship is able to use a variety of weapons scattered as power-ups throughout each level. They include: standard lasers, the Vulcan Cannon (a chaingun-like weapon), the Spreadfire Cannon (a rapidly firing, shotgun-like energy weapon), the Plasma Cannon (a rapidly firing energy weapon more suited for medium-range combat), and the Fusion Cannon (fires a ball of energy that's more powerful the longer it is charged it up, but could destroy the ship). All of these weapons, except for the Vulcan Cannon, use the ship's energy supply. The Pyro-PX is also capable of firing regular concussion missiles, homing missiles, proximity bombs (sits in the sky, then explodes when something gets close to it), smart missiles (more powerful homing missiles that fire out homing energy balls upon impact with their target), and Mega Missiles (the ultimate weapons of mass destruction).\n\nThe goal of each level is to locate and destroy the mine's reactor. Once completed, there are only 45 seconds to find the escape hatch to get out of the mine before it explodes. As progress is made through the game, the AI will adapt to player's strategies and attempt to prevent the player from reaching the goals.",

The only way to transform back is to reach the end of the cave...\n\n<i>Bubble Bobble</i> is a platform game, with each level being a single screen. The enemies must be cleared from a level to go to the next one. With one player controlling Bub and the other controlling Bob, the player can jump and collect items for points (such as fruit). The real power Bub and Bob have however is the ability to blow bubbles. These bubbles can be as platforms to leap on, or to trap enemies. Enemies trapped in a bubble must be popped by jumping into them, wherein they'll turn to fruit. Additionally, power-ups sometimes float by in bubbles. They include lightning, which flies out horizontally at enemies, and water, which drags the player and enemies straight down flowing over platforms. Taking too long to complete any level will summon Baron Von Blubba, who will float around the screen trying to destroy the player.",

Like the Epic games and the classic \"21st Century\" pinball games on Amiga, BoS has a top-down scrolling screen, with an animated dot matrix display at the bottom.  It also features a full-table view.  Very high scores are awarded with a \"powerball\" end bonus mode, and could be posted on the \"WorldScores\" net site (no longer available).  Being a Windows game, all tables boast high-resolution graphics.\r\n\r\nThis game was included in Encore's \"Pinball Madness 2\" collection in 1999.",

Instead of a wimpy pistol, you get a tommy gun (which doesn't need to be reloaded). Unfortunately, you also have limited ammo and need to buy more at times. Instead of lives you have a fixed supply of money, and each time you die you lose some cash. Lose it all and it's game over.",

      "description": "In the two volumes of <i>Elfland</i> you play as an Elf fighting off the evil trolls that have invaded your homeland.  In volume one make the perilous journey to Gorgimer's Castle to get a potion that will help against the trolls. Gorgimer the Alchemist isn't friendly to strangers so you must find a way to convince him to help the Elves.  In volume two you will continue the adventure as you rescue the village elves by defeating the Troll Chieftain.\n\nAt the start of the game, choose to play as a boy or girl (Elfie or Elfita).  Gameplay consists largely of platform jumping while avoiding enemies.  You can jump up into trees, across clouds, and down into darkened caverns.  An assortment of enemies will attack and block your way, but it is possible to temporarily stun them by throwing flash berries. The game is over when your life meter reaches zero.\n\nThe adventuring aspect of this game consists of talking to other characters that reveal tips and plot developments. Every friendly NPC has something to say.  The game starts in the safety of the Elf village, so talk to everyone.  While exploring <i>Elfland</i> you'll find flash berries, gems, cherries, and other bonus items.  In this game elves can't swim, so be careful around water, usually a turtle will help out.  Plenty of secret things are waiting to be found so look up in the clouds.\n\nFinally, the game features a handy save and reload system.  The game is divided into two major chapters, the first of which can be freely downloaded.\n\n<i>Elfland</i> was inspired by Captain Comic and ID's Commander Keen series.",

      "description": "<i>Tyrian 2000</i> is a direct re-release of the original action smash, Tyrian. It is essentially the same game with an additional new episode (Hazudra Fodder), a revised engine (less bugs and better controls) and added Windows support. It also adds another option called \"Timed Battle\".\n\nTyrian is nothing like your run-of-the-mill shoot-'em-up. It gained a following even larger than the classic Raptor: Call of the Shadows, and rightfully so: it has a plot. A plot, you ask? Yes. And even a complex one. You play the role of Trent Hawkings, this galaxy's ace solo fighter-pilot, whose luck forces him to save the galaxy, one time after another. Again and again, Trent must fight off MicroSol, a company with the evil intent of taking over the galaxy. Through your struggles, you will find yourself again and again betrayed by friends and allies, your parents will be killed and you will have to return to points you've already been to (with variations on the levels) in order to remove further threats to the galaxy and to yourself, all for the ultimate goal of overthrowing MicroSol.\n\nTyrian also has two player arcade mode and supports network/modem/serial play. It features a multi-layered ship upgrade engine, in which you can change hulls, decide upon and upgrade your front and rear weapons, buy better shields and generators and even add ship \"sidekicks\". Tyrian's complete arsenal amound to over a dozen type of ships and over 100 weapon types!",

      "description": "<i>Virtua Cop 2</i> is a light gun rail shooter like its predecessor Virtua Cop. The player assumes the role of a police officer and is sent after criminals, from subways and a bank to aboard helicopters.\n\nIt follows the same gameplay pattern of its predecessor and is played from a first person perspective. The game moves the player automatically, although the player  can find hiding places to shoot from a safe angle. The main task is to aim and fire the cop\u2019s weapon so as to take out the bad guys for points. Avoid the innocents, as shooting them costs the player points. The enemies have tougher firepower than in the original and the game can be played solo or with a friend.",

      "description": "Just like its predecessors <i>Need for Speed: High Stakes</i> is an action racing game with a wide selection of exotic sports cars and many different types of tracks. The trademark Hot Pursuit mode game mode from the first game in the series is still present, where players race opponents on tracks filled with regular traffic and police cars that chase the racers. The classic pursuit mode is extended with two additional modes: Getaway and Time Trap. In Getaway the player needs to shake off the police in a set amount of time, or playing as the police trap a speeder before time runs out. In Time Trap an entire race needs to be completed before time runs out, or as the police all speeders need to be arrested. There are minor differences between the two platforms for this game mode, regarding spike strips, road blocks, and back-up. The latter for instance is unique to the PlayStation version. The Pursuit mode is available in multiplayer as well and players can take different sides or race together.\n\nIt is the first game in the series to introduce a Career mode with a set of challenges. Beating these is rewarded with trophies for unlocks, and money to spend on new cars, repairs and upgrades. In the PlayStation version the Career mode is split up into two different sets of challenges: Tournament (required races) and Special Event (optional races). <i>High Stakes</i> in the title refers to races where players bet their cars. In the PC version these are a part of the Career mode when the player owns more than two cars. In the PlayStation version two players can insert their memory cards and race against each other. The winner immediately receives the opponent's car and it is deleted from the loser's memory card right away.\n\nIn addition to the new game modes it is also the first game in the series to have a detailed physics models. Damage now affects both the appearance and the performance of the car for the first time.",

The player can choose from 15 different fighters at the start (and several unlockables later on). Many fighters from earlier games in the series make a comeback (like Scorpion, Sub Zero, Liu Kang, Sonya Blade, Johnny Cage etc.) while other new fighters join in, like Shinook (who is the main evil character in this game), Fujin, Jarek, and Kai. Goro returns as a boss\n\nGameplay is very typical for a <i>Mortal Kombat</i> game, but has several new features - for example characters can use weapons in a fight (not only as a special move) or avoid attacks in the 3D environment.\n\n",

This remake keeps some of the original game's shooter-style gameplay while mixing in more console-style exploration.  Gameplay progresses through five \"worlds\":  Weedom, Frostonia, Infernium, Enigma, and Evile.  Players blast away at the classic centipedes, spiders, fleas, and scorpions while fighting new enemies like the mosquito, cockroach, and killer mushroom.  A \"classic\" mode is also included, which allows players to play the classic game in a new \"3D\" isometric perspective.",

Saturn mode plays like the arcade game, but offers the player different characters to choose from. Character selection matters since they each have varying attributes such as their reload time and how much damage they can take before dying. The Boss Mode allows the player to fight one boss of their choosing or all of the game's four boss monsters consecutively.",

In five areas of the planet, they have erected energy generators, creating a field that slowly encompasses the entire planet surface. They have also taken hundreds of humans prisoner. Someone has to stop them. Enter Russian Commander Ivan Popovich, nicknamed \"Krazy Ivan\". He is a paranoid schizophrenic, prone to burst out into violence at any time. In other words, he's perfect for the job.\n\nThe player controls Ivan's \"Steel Cossack\" power suit on the three-dimensional battlefields. In each of the five areas in the game, two kinds of enemies can be found: Drones and Sentients. Drones are smaller air and ground vehicles that often respawn. Sentients are mechs similar in size and capability to the Steel Cossack. Each of the Sentients must be eliminated before the energy field generator can be destroyed to complete the mission.\n\nThe Cossack is capable of carrying lots of weapons: projectile and energy guns, unguided and guided missiles, and other special weapons. Destroyed enemies reveal captured humans, to be rescued by Ivan, and power-ups, which recharge shields or rearm weapons.\n\nAfter a successful mission, Ivan can upgrade the Cossack with more powerful weapons and replace the mech's armor.\n\nBetween the missions, rather humorous live-action cutscenes (starring English actors sporting thick Russian accents) continue the story.",

Others are rally tracks where you go from one end of the track to the other instead of doing circuit racing. \n\nTwo completely different single-player modes available. First, there's factory driver, which have you join Porsche as a test driver. As you complete different challenges, which can vary from doing specific manoeuvres in pre-alloted time to racing fellow drivers, you will make your way up to Ace Test Driver. Second, there's Evolution, which is the \"career mode\", you start with enough money to buy one 356, and start racing. As you win races, time will pass, new cars will become available, or you can peruse the used car market. Buy/repair/sell cars, win races, buy enhancement parts for your car, and make your way to the end of the modern era...\n\nYou can also play online via EARacing.com, where you can pick customized cars in your Evolution stable or choose stock cars and race up to 7 other cars simultaneously. \n\nThe graphics have been enhanced and the physics model changed to reflect a true 4-point system, and you can feel the difference between the different vehicles.

The game rewards the player for destroying windows, light fixtures, computers, explosive barrels, and even fire extinguishers. Each consecutive hit increases your streak rating (which adds to your score) and certain combinations of these collateral hits will open up secret bonus rooms.\n\nThe home version has special bonuses and additional secret levels not found in the arcade version and a mouse option is available.",

Gameplay uses the Breakout idea of using a bat to guide a ball around a screen smashing bricks, without letting it drop off the bottom of the screen. It adds power-up tokens, such as - multiple balls, mounted guns to shoot out bricks, a more destructive ball, and a larger bat.\n\nSporting a completely revised game engine with new graphics, faster framerates and support for in-game music via Carlos Hasan's SEAL, <i>DX-Ball 2</i> is sold as five different board packs - <i>Board Pack 1</i>, <i>Board Pack 2</i>, <i>Board Pack 3</i>, <i>Memorial Pack</i>, and <i>Classic Pack</i>. The demo version includes a sample of <i>Board Pack 1</i>. It was later rereleased with new content as DX-Ball 2: 20th Anniversary Edition",

This entails flying around the 3D level and taking out targets such as: communication uplinks, shield generators, the occasional alien fighter craft, and ultimately bringing down the major alien ship via a strike on its main cannon. Powerups are plentiful, such as medical packs that heal your jetcraft, bonus weapons, bonus planes, and an item that freezes enemy planes for a brief time.\n\nMission settings include the Grand Canyon, Washington D.C., and New York City. There are other missions that are provided on a need-to-know basis (as stated in the manual). The game also features 2-player head-to-head action via a network or null modem link.",

      "description": "Jack Butcher is a former soldier, and now an assassin working for the government. His contact Sabre has a new assignment for him: take out Jacques Arnoud, head of Microkomm and an associate of the Red Storm Rebellion. They are planning to use Microkomm's new government contract to fund a rebellion, and the government wants him dead. This should have been an easy assignment - hit and run, escaping through the roof. However, seconds after Jack shoots Arnoud, a guard bursts through the door. After narrowly avoiding capture by the guard, a bomb blows the stairways to the roof. Jack is stuck in a building crawling with guards and security drones who are out to get him.\n\n<i>Assassin 2015</i> is a plot-driven 3D first-person shooter focusing on combat rather than exploration. Opening the wrong door or going the wrong way will usually result in the player character's death, as he will encounter a horde of guards or drones. The player listens to the instructions of Jett Jones, the protagonist's only outside support, and follows her directives. The gameplay is mostly linear and involves traversing corridors and rooms and shooting the enemies within. However, the game features some other scenes, such as running away from a giant robot and an elevator shootout.",

Much like the first in the series, the sequel has plenty of high performance cars to choose from, including the McLaren F1, Ferrari F50, Lotus GT1, Jaguar XJ220, Ford GT90, Isdera Commendatore 112i, Italdesign Cala and Lotus Esprit V8, each handling differently.\n\nOnce the player has beaten the six tracks, a new track is made available. It's a fast paced racing game which is intended to play more like an arcade racer than a true simulation, though the player can select which driving style suits him or her best: arcade or simulation. \n\nThere are three game modes: single race, tournament (in which the player must get the highest score in order to win) and knock out (in which the player has to outrun at least one car at the end of each track to avoid elimination). Car settings such as gear ratio, downforce, break bias and color can be customized. The opponents' skill can also be chosen, as well as the presence of civilian traffic in the tracks. The game offers four options of camera views: heli-cam, tail-cam, in-car and road cam. A replay mode with eight cinematic cameras is also available.\n\nThe main difference between this and the previous <i>Need for Speed</i> game is in the tracks, with less open road tracks in this sequel. Also, there are no cops to chase the player. However, the tracks available are have a range of detail, and some have changing weather conditions while the player races.",

This game revolves around a character named Saul who narrates the opening of each level, describing a little more of what he is doing and how he got himself into the present situation. The craft he pilots is called a T-77 which is agile, speedy, and armed with twin cannons. Throughout the levels, the player can collect upgraded cannons and a variety of explosive devices and other weapons with which to dispatch enemies and help with mining EZT, the prized material in this game. Swarm boasts 4 difficulty settings and 100 playable levels.",

The Dark Dragon needs to be destroyed, and you, Keil Fluge,  are aboard a dragon and armed with a powerful weapon to do so. \n\nIn this shooter, you ride an armored dragon on a predefined path with 360\u00ba of freedom (you can rotate and zoom in and out). This path takes you through an aquatic setting, through a tunnel and over a forest, and into combat with giant worms, wasps and flies. Each level ends with a boss. In a idea influenced by the film Blade Runner, cutscenes use a fusion language combining elements of German, Latin and Japanese.",

Amy overhears Robotnik's plan, so she will also be racing to get the Chaos Emeralds.\r\n\r\nThere are many modes of gameplay in Sonic R:\r\n\r\nGrand Prix: You race against the rest of the characters on each of the circuits, and get a chance to race the level's boss to unlock some of the extra playable characters.\r\n\r\nTime Attack: Run on one of the tracks as fast as you can, get 5 balloons or tag 4 characters.\r\n\r\nMulti Player: 4 players on a split-screen or over a network. You can race against up to three players or challenge them on a balloon finding game. The screen can be divided horizontally or vertically for 2 player games. \r\n\r\n",

      "description": "The action has moved on 500 years since the original game, Z, and an uneasy cease-fire exists between the two vast war machines of TransGlobal Industries and the MegaCom Corporation. The final phase of the peace initiative is only hours away when an incident takes place, which throws this short-lived truce into complete disarray.\r\n\r\nWar is firmly back on the agenda.\r\n\r\nWhile initial thoughts may be that Z: Steel Soldiers is another recruit to the growing army of real time strategy games, Z: Steel Soldiers should be viewed as an arcade strategy title with the emphasis firmly on action, the players\u2019 combat decisions and their subsequent consequences.\r\n\r\nThe taking of territory is still paramount for victory as buildings can only be constructed on land owned by the player. But now, gamers must also think about which territory will best suit their strategy. \r\n\r\nEach sector on the map will feature a flag displaying a number from 1 to 5, the higher the number the quicker the game\u2019s resource, Xenonite, will be mined. The temptation may well be to secure those territories that will deliver the most Xenonite so forces can be quickly built up. But the game\u2019s 3D environments mean that some territories will be strategically better than others. So, taking control of high ground with a relatively small yield of Xenonite may well prove more advantageous in the long term than quickly snatching a valley based territory with low strategic value and a high resource yield.\r\n\r\nThe action in Z: Steel Soldiers takes place in six very distinct worlds each with its own unique environment. From arid desert to lush forest each throws up its own geographical challenges for the player. In addition each world has its own environmental systems and specific life forms.\r\n\r\nThe game\u2019s different environments have meant that Z: Steel Soldiers will feature not only land based units but also naval and airforce which includes helicopters and jets. In total players will have access to up to 30 units, the hardware becoming more powerful and destructive as the player progresses through the game.\r\n\r\nDesigned from the ground up as a true 3D game it comes as no surprise that Z: Steel Soldiers features a state of the art engine that really brings the game\u2019s worlds to life.  Units will make tracks in soft ground or kick up dust on dry terrain and all objects are subject to real time shadows and reflections. Other natural effects such as weather and transitions from day to night are incredibly realistic thanks to the game\u2019s physics system. \r\n\r\nZ: Steel Soldiers is more than a number of isolated missions with no structure thrown together to make a game. It features a progressive plot driven story line written by Martin Pond, the man responsible for bringing the world of Medievil and the universe of Imperium Galactica 2 to life. Full of intrigue and conspiracy, the story will be updated through luscious cut scenes created by leading industry lights AudioMotion.\r\n\r\nCited as one of Z\u2019s strongest attributes, the AI in Z: Steel Soldiers is even more complex yet flexible enough to respond to gamers of all levels. It can be passive or aggressive in its nature from reinforcing territories to scouting or manufacturing of units in response to the player\u2019s situation.",
