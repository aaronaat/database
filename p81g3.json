      "description": "Christopher Blair, \"Heart of the Tiger\" had retired to a farming planet after the war, content with retirement, so he says... In the depths of space, a new menace has surfaced. Some unknown attackers are killing civilian ships. The tension between the Confederation and the Border Worlds is at an all time high, as both sides accuse the other of staging the attacks. Admiral Tolwyn has recalled Blair back to service, where he will make the most difficult choice of all... And contemplate action he had never dared before, in the name of justice...\n\n<i>Wing Commander IV: The Price of Freedom</i> is a mix of interactive movie and space sim. The game has a dynamic mission tree, which means the player's behaviour will determine the next mission. The videos feature real actors, like Mark Hamill, Tom Wilson, John Rhys-Davies and Malcolm McDowell. Before the start of each mission, the space craft can be equipped with different weapons. Sometimes the mission objectives change during flight, and the player has to make decisions what he wants to do next, e.g. help out his friend or destroy an enemy fighter.",

You are once again the mayor, but this time you can fully customize the terrain before building your city. The graphics are isometric, whereas the original had graphics displayed in a top-down fashion.\n\nThis title adds numerous features over the original such as the ability of building \"light\" zones, subways, hospitals, colleges, zoos, and arcos which are actually cities in cities. You can now give names to places, and your city is surrounded by neighboring towns with which you can make trade. Finally, instead of the poll in the first game you now have the option of reading several newspapers to get an idea of your progress.",

There several additional rooms, such as a staff room for your employees to rest, a toilet so that patients don't have to relieve themselves in the corridors, a research department to get the most advanced diagnostic and treatment technologies and a training room where consultants can teach a thing or two to rookies, making them capable doctors. The size and layout of each room can be set by the player, according to the available space. In addition to rooms, the player must provide radiators, seating for patients and drink machines.\n\nHowever, rooms don't run by themselves. Most diagnostic and clinics can work with regular doctors, but others like the operating theater and the research room require specialized staff while the ward, pharmacy and the fracture clinic require an attending nurse. At the same time, the hospital can't run without handymen cruising around the hospital to water up dry plants, clean up litter and vomit (after all, people go there because they <i>are</i> sick) and fix machines, while receptionists direct patients to the proper rooms.\n\nAs levels advance, the player faces increasingly harder situations: VIP visits, emergencies, epidemics and earthquakes, which can either take a toll on reputation or on the bank account. On the other hand, as more and more equipment is required, additional plots of land are available for purchase in later maps.",

There are eight versions of each vehicle; two 97 models, two 98 models, two 99 models, and two 2000 models. Each model varies in performance, the slowest being the 97 models and the fastest being the 2000 models.\n\nThe player can compete in single-player mode where he gets to choose the cars and tracks freely if unlocked in the second game mode, the career mode, which is more ambitious. Here the player takes the role of a low ranked driver, starting with slower cars and paving his way to the top. Also in the career mode it is possible to upgrade the tires, suspension, transmission, brakes, and engine of the car, as well as reduce its weight. ",

From there, taking advantage of their fast reproduction rate, the player can train new workers, and as soon as three different wooden huts are available, the council will allow the construction of a cement yard, which in turn allow the construction of better buildings. However, slobs wouldn't appreciate living in such luxury, and so a gadget factory can be built so that computers are distributed to their houses, allowing for a new generation of better educated citizens. \nWhile the workers pack a nasty punch when in a large group, violence should be left to the professionals. After building a Pizza Parlor, the player is allowed to use the services of gangsters. These are able to take on that pesky foreman or that building the Council asked to get rid off.\n\nBut there's more to the game than build from ghetto houses to luxury buildings, and as they say, all is fair in war, and construction IS war. The player can send his foremen to capture other teams' buildings, or do even worse: provide housing for the scum of society. From hippies to ghosts, these can do a number on the other teams' properties. Want to stress out a tenant? Send the thugs to do a wild party in their house. Need some cash or materials? Send the thief to relieve a team from them. All this while avoiding the others do the same on you by assigning police patrol to key areas. \nAs time passes, it pays out to build other, more friendly, buildings. A school allows everyone to breed more civilized members of the society, the hospital allows recovery of wounds much faster or the park, where everyone goes to relax a little, among others. Improving the rooms and giving them garden furniture is also a good way of keeping tenants happy, but jealously can grow among neighbors. Failing to comply to tenants requests and demands will quickly turn the Council against the player.\n\nThe player will have to balance the output of their tenants to achieve success: overdoing one of the elements will take a dent on the bank account (leading to bankruptcy), cut the arrival of new workers (putting a strain of existing teams), replacement for deceased tenants (leaving houses vacant that eventually decay into a flaming pile of rubble not before giant cockroaches settle in) or police and mob favors (to patrol areas against undesirables and gangster actions). \n\nThe difficulty level affect what maps can be selected, but also which  actions the undesirables can perform. To choose higher difficulty settings, more computer players (up to three) must be activated.",

The game focuses more on relationships than making money - which is the goal in all other Harvest Moon games to date.  You still are running a farm and must succeed in the life of a farmer, but the actual gameplay rewards those who interact with the townspeople over those who just work the fields.\r\n\r\n",

All have their own personal reasons in catching the King River fish and are subject to different story plots. Each also have different starting character statistics.\n\n<b>GAMEPLAY</b>\n\nGameplay of the Harvest Fishing may be categorized as the following:\n\n<li><b>Real-time Fishing Simulation and Preparation</b><br>\nThe fishing simulation in Harvest Fishing consists of various approaches which refer to different types of tools you can choose from to fish: Different fishing rods, different baits and lures attract different fish, making some easier or harder depending on which combination you choose. Fishing instruments may be purchased at a local store, while bait may either be purchased or be searched in your surroundings.\n\nYou start with one type of rod and minimal bait varieties. Catching fish requires you to fish near a body of water and wait for the fish to bite (results vary on different rods). After a bite, you enter a real-time fishing simulation sequence, where you can visibly see the fish underwater. You then have to lure the fish in while making sure your fishing line doesn't break. Captured fish may then be released, sold at the fishmonger for money or used for cooking ingredients or other requirements for sub-quests.\n\nFailure to catch fish during this simulation will result in your character losing HP as well as the bait.\n\n<li><b>Adventuring</b><br>\nThere are a lot of fishing spots to choose from in this game. The others however must be first unlocked by following the plot of the story. Several mini-quests are also available to choose as well as participating in fishing and cooking tournaments.\n\nSuccessfully catching fish will add experience to your fishing skill which will lead to leveling up your fishing level. Successfully trying cooking recipes will also increase your cooking level skill.",

      "description": "In July 2001 it was discovered that an terrorist organization known as the \"The Solar Martyrs\", hiding in a small country called Banhar, may have nuclear weapons at their disposal. The U.S. government decided that a large-scale attack would prove risky, and so a small group of Special Forces was formed...\n\n\"Only one machine is fit for such a task...\"\n\nIn this simulator the player controls an AH-64 Apache, the \"primary attack helicopter in the U.S. Arsenal\". It can be controlled from 5 different points of view, including 1st (inside the cockpit) and 3rd person ones. The on screen display holds valuable information to the pilot, such as damage meters, status of engines, rotor brakes, wheel brakes and hover, air speed, altitude, compass, radar, RPM, Torque, Fuel and more.\n\nThe game features two control systems: arcade and physics mode. In arcade mode the helicopter maintains altitude while flying forward, while the physics mode is based on real world physics, thus, when the helicopter is moving forward, it will also lose altitude if the motor power isn't increased. The helicopter can be controlled either with a keyboard/mouse combo or with a joystick.\n\nThe AH-64 comes equipped with 3 different types of weapons: Hellfire Missiles, m230 Chain Gun 30mm Automatic Cannon and Hydra Rockets. There is also a fourth kind of weapon, the Zuni Rockets, only available later in the game. Hellfire missiles are target lockable and the Cannon can be aimed with the mouse.\n\nThere are 30 unique missions in this game; in most of them the player must accomplish several objectives, usually destroying enemy buildings and vehicles. The game can be saved at the end of each mission, but not during them. If the player gets killed during a mission, he must start it all over again, but the number of tries is unlimited.",

      "description": "<i>DiRT</i> is the first racing game in the Colin McRae series not to solely focus on the rally championship. It features other offroad events with vehicles like buggies, jeeps or trucks all licensed from the manufacturers. Races are not always solo against the times of other drivers, but up to eight cars often race together on a single track.\n\nThe main game mode is the career where you work your up a pyramid of different tiers with events ranging from normal Rallies over Crossover or Corr to Hill Climb. For every event you complete successfully, you get points and money. Money is used to buy new cars. While the amount of money depends on choosing one of the five difficulty levels, the amount of points depends on your final result in the event; you receive the maximum of 10 points for completing an event with a first place regardless of the difficulty level. These points are needed to unlock new events in the current tier. If you have gathered enough points the next tier will be automatically unlocked so you don't need to do every race in a tier in order to unlock the final event at the top. The difficulty level not only influences the strength of the other drivers, but also how critical the damage is upon hitting obstacles. Some events are further split up into two or three races where the damage is carried over and the allotted sixty seconds worth of damage repair is not offered after every subevent. The main parts that can be repaired are the engine, turbo, exhaust, gearbox, bodywork, wheels, suspension, cooling system and it is also possible to clean the entire car.\n\nAll events feature several licensed true-to-detail-vehicles which also have a detailed damage model. Each vehicle can in addition be tuned in several categories like engine or suspension before each event. To help you make it even more individual, you can create your own look of the car with several dozens predefined kits. There are also 182 different liveries to collect in the game and 46 different cars.\n\nIn addition to the career mode, the game features the classic Colin McRae rally mode with four championships where you need to proof your worth in several car categories like 2WD or Classic. Of course you can also do a time trial, a single event or a single race.\n\nIf you're tired of driving only against the AI, you can go online and compete against up to 100 other players at the same time. An official ranking ladder is also available. After each race your best times can be compared directly to other drivers worldwide.",

The game contains a host of new and old rally cars, as well as concept vehicles. Handling is loose and arcade-oriented, and the setup options are not as detailed as those in DiRT. \n\nThere are fifteen circuits across 5 terrain types - safari, alpine, tropical, canyon and arctic. As such, you must drive through snow, sleet, sand, mud, water and gravel. Track deformation technology ensures that no 2 laps are ever the same, as grooves are impacted into the ground and snow is moved off the primary racing line.\n\nGame modes include Quick Race, Championship, Time Attack and Online multiplayer. Time Attack allows plays to set their best times and upload them to 360 Live or PSN. Similarly, players can download other individuals ghosts and try to beat them. Online multiplayer caters for online battles between up to 6 players.",

      "description": "<em>Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock</em> is the third full game in the Guitar Hero series and fourth game overall. The gameplay remains similar to the previous games: using a guitar-shaped controller, you need to coordinate pressing the five fret buttons and strumming to the scrolling notes on screen. Missing notes will cause your performance meter to drop; if the meter drops too low then the performance is a failure and you will need to try again. This edition of the game features 71 new songs to play from various artists including Cream, The Rolling Stones, Black Sabbath, Aerosmith, Guns N' Roses, Santana, Sonic Youth, Weezer, and many more. In addition to the available songs the game also features \"boss battles\" against famous guitarists such as Slash, Tom Morello and Lou the Devil. Several game modes are available including career mode, co-op mode, and multiplayer mode. In addition to the main game modes, training and practice modes are available to aid in learning the game or figuring out a tricky passage in a song.\n\nIn <b>career mode</b> you play the part of a wanna-be rock star. Beginning with easier songs in small venues, you need to successfully complete tracks to make your way up to a superstar. Each venue you play requires a certain number of songs to be performed before you can move on to the next larger venue. Successful completion of songs also earns money which can be used to unlock characters, outfits, new guitars, and other bonuses.\n\nThe <b>co-op career mode</b> is similar to the single player variation, except two players work together (one on lead guitar, the other on bass or rhythm guitar) to complete songs. \n\nThe <b>multiplayer</b> game modes allow two players to compete against each other. In the Face-Off variation, two players take turns performing a song. The Pro Face-Off variation allows two players to compete at the same time playing the exact same note chart. Finally, in the battle mode each player can earn power ups by performing well which can be used to disrupt the other player.",

Launched from a human-sized slingshot, the player's character needs to complete specific goals or inflict as much damage as possible by stringing together painful collisions, similar to Truck Dismount and Stair Dismount. After setting the power and rotation, the player can steer their ragdoll through the environment (a force called Ooch in the game), similar to the way post-crashes are handled in the Burnout series. The game's environment is set in a downtown area and six different game modes are available with the initial release.\n\nSingle-player modes:<ul>\n<li>Mime Toss (grab a mime in mid-air and hurl the the silent artiste through a number of panes)</li>\n<li>PAINdemonium (sandbox gameplay)</li>\n<li>Spank The Monkey (target monkeys to take them out)</li></ul>Multi-player modes:<ul>\n<li>Bowling (up to four players bowl themselves while the other players can throw mimes, anvils, explosives or cereal in his path)</li>\n<li>Fun With Explosives (target crates strategically to cause big explosions)</li>\n<li>HORSE (launch a powerful shot to cause a maximum amount of damage, the other player has to do better)</li>\n</ul>By doing well, trophies can be unlocked in the trophy room.",

Most of the game's new content is provided through the Earn Your Stripes career mode (PS2).\n\nIn Earn your Stripes, you start by going through time trials to get better starting contracts. After you get a contract, you can start racing. You can tune up your car in the areas of acceleration, tire wear, top speed, among several others. After a set amount of races, you will need to go through another time trial to get to the next set of races. As you complete races and gain reputation, more contracts will come in. In every race, you need to complete some objectives set in your contract. Some contracts are easy to complete (such as finishing a race), while others give more complex objectives (such as gaining several allied cars). Players can also race in the Craftsman Truck, National (Busch), and NEXTEL Cup.\n\nThe PS3 and Xbox 360 versions allow players to share their setups online. The chase mode offers a series of challenges like drafting or passing to unlock new features. All versions offer online multiplayer races.",

      "description": "<i>Rock Band</i>, by the original developers behind the Guitar Hero games, takes the concept a step further. Instead of solely playing the guitar along with songs, this game allows players to start a full virtual band with up to four players, with different sequences for each of the three supported peripherals: guitar (electric and bass), drum and microphone. Gameplay is based on hitting scrolling notes on the screen in time (scrolling vertically for drum and guitar), and getting the right pitch for the vocals (scrolling horizontally at the top of the screen, along with the lyrics).\n\nThe game offers a Solo Tour Mode for a single player or a Band World Tour (as well as Quick Play) for two to four players. By doing well players earn cash to customize the characters in the Rock Shop, with tattoos, face paint, clothing and logos. Customized characters are automatically locked to an instrument. Other customizations include movements on stage, instruments, and the general physique and appearance in the game. To succeed, players need to reach a set score through their combined performances. Multipliers for playing perfectly are tracked for the individual instruments and there can also be separate difficulty levels. The Star Power from the Guitar Hero series has been replaced by Overdrive, a meter filled by not making any mistakes in certain sections of a song. In band play using Overdrive also increases the band's score multiplier.\n\nPlayers who fail during the song are locked out and the audio mix takes over. Other band members can revive the player by using their Overdrive. Failed players will however drag down the band's overall performance, so it becomes important to bring back band members. Next to the Overdrive sections, there are also Union Phrases (score bonus and extra Overdrive) and sometimes Big Rock Endings at the end of a song where another bonus can be gained.\n\nIn the Tour Mode players visit 41 venues in seventeen different cities. After the initial venues, others need a certain numbers of fans to be unlocked and certain continents only become available when tour buses or private jets are acquired. Not every venue comes with a set list of tracks. They consists of single tracks, multiple tracks, custom setlists or mystery setlists. Performing poorly can also have the band lose fans. Extra competition is included to attract managers, roadies and deals with record labels. \n\nNext to the main modes there is also a versus mode for the individual instruments (Tug of War), Score Duel (get the most points) and a Tutorial mode. The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions feature multiplayer games with new songs through downloadable content.\n\nThe European version is not sold as a single package. Instead, there is an instruments package and the game is sold separately, for a much higher price than the original US release.",

It also contains improved support for Logitech Driving Force steering controllers and a wider variety of options. Ferraris will be included for the first time in the series and it includes visible car damage.\n\nThe driving physics have been  improved on and cars handle more realistically than in GT4. The game contains more music, ranging from lounge and jazz-funk to indie and electronica.\n\nThe base version is upgraded through different digital downloads, adding new modes and videos (1.11 - December 2007) and a much larger update (2.0 - March 2008) with new cars, circuits, modes, events and different features. Since 2.0, the game is referred to as <i>Gran Turismo 5: Prologue - Spec II</i>. That version was updated once more in April 2008 as 2.10 with more features. These updates are free to download, but in some countries the updated version is actually the retail one. PAL regions received the 2.0 version while North American received 2.10 by default.",

      "description": "The heart of <i>GRID</i> is the career-mode called GRID World. Divided into the three regions USA, Europe and Japan, the player has to earn money and prestige points to move up into a higher license category which then gives him access to more and harder racing events. These events are divided into categories like normal races, Drift-events, Destruction Derbies and even the famous 24 hours race in Le Mans.\n\nBut of course not every car is suitable for every event so there are several different series to chose from. So while the player drives a tuned car for the Drift- or Racing-events in Japan, muscle cars await him in for the Destruction Derbies in the USA or Formel 3000 racers in Europe. Each car also handles very differently. Of course the player needs to buy the suitable car first before he can enter a tournament. There he can decide if he wants to buy a brand new car or go over to eBay Motors and look for a solid used car which of course cost less but has already seen some crashes and might not provide the best possible performance.\n\nTo earn the money to buy a car for a event, the player can complete so-called Driver Offers. These are offers by other racing teams to take part in an event and see it through. But there are also bonus objectives like \"Finish before Team Top Secret\" which grant the player additional cash if he successfully completes them.\n\nBesides money the player also earns prestige points. These are required to unlock the next higher license category in the corresponding country. Of course tournaments give way more points than completing Driver Offers but the player can also get a few more points by adjusting the realism settings before the race. The higher the realism is, the higher the point gain will be after successful finishing the event. These settings include things like a difficulty level, traction assistant or how many flashbacks the player has available during a race. These flashbacks are similar to the Sands of Time in the Prince of Persia-Series. If the player for example drifts out into the gravel pit, he can activate the instant replay, rewind time a little bit and then immediately reenter the race at that point and try to avoid the crash.",

It was created as a sneak preview of Gran Turismo 5, similar to the three Concept games that were released between Gran Turismo 3 and Gran Turismo 4.\n\nThis version contains ten cars, an external, rear and bumper view, a single track (The Eiger Nordwand) with an unlockable reverse mode, two game modes (Time Trial and Drift Trial) and a replay mode. The versions vary per country and region (1.1, 1.2, 2.0) and were released both on discs and as digital downloads. All versions for the game made available through the PlayStation Store were free of charge. The Japanese retail version <i>Gran Turismo HD: Install Disc</i> includes v1.1 of the game, the Concept Movie Type B video trailer and a PlayStation Store manual.\n\nEventually, in March 2007 the planned full title <i>Gran Turismo HD</i> was cancelled and all priority was given to <i>Gran Turismo 5</i>. Instead, Gran Turismo 5: Prologue was released as a new sneak preview of the full GT5 game.",

      "description": "<i>Guitar Hero: Aerosmith</i> is considered an expansion of Guitar Hero III and it is the first title in the series primarily focused on a single band. The gameplay concept is similar to the game it is based on. About 60% of the included tracks are by Aerosmith, while the others have influenced or have opened for the band (Run-D.M.C., The Kings, Lenny Kravitz, ...). Four songs were re-recorded by the band directly for the game and they also performed as motion capture actors for their 3D models. The majority of the tracks consists of master recordings.\n\nThe prominent game segment is the career mode where players go through the band's history, from the earlier seventies to 2001. Times of internal issues are not touched upon. Players initially start as Joe Perry but can later also unlock the other band members Brad Whitford and Tom Hamilton. The career has been divided into six tiers with five tracks, each based on a period in the band's history. There are also encores when a tier has been completed, and two opening acts playing as another band. After each tier, bonus material is shown such as trivia or video sequences and interviews.\n\nSongs are unlocked gradually and become available in the other modes, identical to <i>Guitar Hero III</i> (Quickplay, Cooperative, Competitive + Battle modes). Only the cooperative career mode is absent. The menus have been redesigned and there are new venues, based on historical performances. There are 41 songs in total, of which 31 can be unlocked in the career mode and an additional 10 in the vault.\n\nThe game is available in a bundle with a custom guitar or as a single game release. For the PS2 version there are two bundles, one with a single, wireless guitar and another with two, wired guitars.",

      "description": "If you think it's a hassle to clean out the grill, marinate meat, watch it slowly get burned on the grill as it starts to rain outside... this might be the game for you. <i>Yakinikubugy\u014d</i> puts you in the role of a BBQ chef, and it's your job to make sure the customers leave happy and full from your restaurant.\n\nThe goal of each stage in the game is to make sure you keep all 3 customers happy when the timer runs out by handing out the right food to the right person, while making sure it's not undercooked or burned to a black piece of coal. The customers each have a food they like and one they hate, and they can suddenly change their minds in the middle of a stage, so figuring out what they want to eat and when is the key to success. You can also earn combos by feeding the same customer several times in a row with food they like.\n\nYou use chop sticks to maneuver around a 3x4 squares big grill where you have to put down pieces of meat and vegetables and grill them to perfection. The closer to the middle of the grill you put the food, the faster it cooks, so if you have a customer yelling at you to hand him/her something, you can put the food there.\n\nIf you're too slow or forget about a piece of food, it slowly turns to coal and you have to tap it to clean the grate. Otherwise you won't be able to use that square again.\n\nYou can either play alone or against a friend. The game is sponsored by Gyu-Kaku, a chain of Japanese BBQ restaurants.",

There the player creates a character, chooses a bike and a helmet for him and starts in the 125cc class with the goal to race to the top of the MotoGP class in only five years. After each successful race the player not only unlocks new content but also gains career points which can be invested into bike upgrades increasing the max speed, acceleration, braking abilities or traction.\n\nThe other game modes are:<ul><li>Time Trial - Beat the time records on the different tracks.</li><br>\n<li>Tournament - Create a driver or choose a driver from the 2008 season to compete in a series of races.</li><br>\n<li>Challenges - 50 challenges in seven categories demand a great deal of the player to unlock additional game content. Challenges include staying over a certain speed limit for a pre-defined amount of time or winning a 1on1 on the last few meters of a race track.</li></ul>The game also features a multiplayer mode for up to 12 players (not for the PS2 version). It is the first in the series to appear on the PS3. The game introduces the new US Indianapolis track and night racing at the Qatar circuit.",

      "description": "<i>Guitar Hero: World Tour</i> is the fourth main game in the series and brings a major change to the concept. Following the release of Rock Band that built on the <i>Guitar Hero</i> concept but added additional instruments, <i>World Tour</i> introduces these as well to allow players to play together simultaneously as a real band. Next to the guitar that was the main peripheral for the previous titles, the bundled edition of the game adds a microphone for the vocal parts and drums for percussion. Just like the previous game, the guitar tracks are split up for the lead and bass. The lyrics and the vocal pitch is shown near the top of the screen, while the bottom part is split up for bass guitar, lead guitar and drums, each with a separate set of notes that need to be hit to correctly play the part.\n\nWhile playing, a rock meter keeps track of successive notes hit (one for each player), which leads to score multipliers. When the meter becomes too low, other players can make up for this on a shared, general performance meter. In the same vein players share a star power meter, built up by playing through certain sections successfully, that any player can access.\n\nThere are four difficulty levels and a new beginner mode where notes are made as easy as possible to introduce the concept to new players. Most of the game content is centered around a Career mode (both Solo and Band) where players start a new band, choose an avatar an instrument, and then play different gigs unlocking new songs along the way. Completing tracks earns money that can be spent on outfits or instruments. There are once again encore songs and \"boss challenges\" where the lead guitar enters a duel. This is similar to the battles in <i>Guitar Hero III</i>, but without the power-ups. Instead it returns to a call-and-response mechanic similar to the Face-Off mode. Bands consists of offline players but online members can join as well. Complete bands can take on others online through the Battle of the Bands mode.\n\nThrough the Music Studio editor new songs can be composed and shared using the GHTunes service (not for the PS2). In this edition avatars can be customized with more detail using the Create-a-Rocker mode. Major artists have licensed their appearance in the game. The Wii version contains a Mii Freestyle mode where players can use their Mii characters in-game and compose songs through motions of the Wii remote and the Nunchuk controller.\n\nThere are several bundles for the game, based on the amount of instruments included, but also a stand-alone version as most of the versions are compatible with the controllers of previous games and even some of <i>Rock Band</i>.",

      "description": "<i>Rock Band 2</i> is the sequel to the 2007 musical simulation game Rock Band and offers similar gameplay. Directly competing with Guitar Hero: World Tour, the game allows different people to play together as in a band, with the same peripherals as the first game: lead guitar, bass guitar, microphone and a drum set.\n\nThe new drum and guitar controllers for this version, bundled or sold separately, have been revised and older controllers are also supported. The guitar controller, modelled after the Fender Stratocaster, has five additional fret buttons near the neck, for fast fingertapping sessions. There is also an effect switch to toggle between five different effects. Players use the instruments to match notes on the screen, divided in different portions for different instruments, along with the lyrics for the singer who need to match the pitch.\n\nThe original game's Solo Tour mode and the multiplayer Band World Tour mode have been merged into a single Tour mode where up to four players can cooperate, both local and online (PS3/Xbox 360). Band leaders are no longer necessary and instruments can be swapped at will. From this mode, three options are available: Start Tour (regular tour mode), Tour Challenge (different challenges), and Battle of the Bands (compete against other bands online through score tracking - not on the PS2). The game includes a training mode for the different instruments, as well as a freestyle mode for drummers where they can drum along with custom mp3 files (Xbox 360/PS3). Other modes and modifiers for the regular game modes can be selected from an Extras menu.\n\nThe in-game characters can also be customized and 84 tracks are included on the disc, with many more as downloadable content (not on the PS2). It is also possible to transfer the songs of the first <i>Rock Band</i> (for a price), and downloadable content as well as the two track packs.",

      "description": "<i>Golden Logres</i> is another pinball simulator by LittleWing. A sequel to both Tristan and Crystal Caliburn, the game features three tables based on the Arthurian legends: Camelot, Land's End and Fisher King. After completing all the missions on one table, the game moves to the next one. A practice mode is available to test the last two tables and prepare to the full game.\n\nIn <b>Camelot</b>, the first table, the objective is to complete all quests, each assigned to a different knight of the round table. The screen shows two medieval banners with the table sitting at the middle. The banners list the active quests, the score, the number of balls left and the status of the game. To start one of the adventures, the player must shoot ramps, sink the ball in holes or drop targets a number of times and then hit the Taliessin holder near the Merlin ramp. Taliessin was a court jester, musician and poet, and he assigns the quests to the knights. When an event occurs, like the end of a quest, a small window appears over the table with a picture and text explaining the situation. After all the quests are complete, the game moves to the next table after hitting the drop targets for the sloth, envy and lust sins, and sinking the ball in the quest hole.\n\nIn the second table called <b>Land's End</b>, Lancelot, Tristan and Gawain, the three knights considered the bravest of them all, must prove their courage by undertaking the most dangerous quests. A multiball starts after completing each adventure. Tristan has to kill the dragon, by shooting its ramp and turning on all the lights that spell its name, then sink the ball in the medicine and \"myst\" hole. Lancelot must lift the curse that fell upon Dolorous Gard, his castle, by shooting the castle ramp and turning on \"CASTLE\", and receive a gift from the Lady of the Lake after dropping the ball in the magic shield hole. Gawain has to defeat the Green Knight by hitting the \"ERRANTRY\" ramp to turn on the letter lights, and collect a proof of bravery from Lady Bercilak by getting the ball inside the sash hole. When all the quests are complete, the game switches back to Camelot automatically.\n\nIn the final <b>Fisher King</b> table, the ultimate goal is to collect the holy grail from the castle. The three guardians of the grail (Perceval, Bors, and Galahad) must acquire the holy relic and bring it back to Camelot. They receive the aid of other three fellow knights: Balin, Gareth and Palomides. Balin must get the Longinus spear that pierced Jesus on the cross, by turning on its name hitting the \"LONGINUS\" spot targets, and enter the castle at the top of the table. Gareth has to defeat the three evil knights, by sinking the ball in the challenge hole and dropping the red, blue and black targets, and finally send the ball to the castle to start a multiball. Palomides must kill Arthur's sin, that became a monster after his death, by shooting the beast lane turning on the \"BEAST\" lights, and sinking the ball in the castle. The grail knights retrieve the sacred cup by hitting the holy targets and the Perceval hole, both activated after colliding with bumpers named after each knight, turning on the \"HOLY GRAIL\" letters at the center. A multiball starts after entering the castle and receiving the grail. After all modes are finished, the game returns to Camelot.",

In order to do so, at the start of the game the player creates one or more characters on the character creation screen which has been even more expanded since The Sims 2. Besides more choices in terms of look, clothes, colors and such, the player also chooses five personality traits from a set of 63 sorted in four groups \"Mental\", \"Physical\", \"Social\" and \"Lifestyle\" as well as a lifetime-goal. The personality traits influence how the Sim reacts to each event in the game. The trait \"work-a-holic\" for example makes the Sim love to go to work and allows him to use a computer at home to put in additional hours.\n\nThe lifetime goal, on the other hand, is similar to wishes but requires a lot of work to get to. While granting wishes can be as simple as ordering a pizza, one lifetime goal requires the player to make his Sim a CEO of a big corporation which can't be done over night. As a compensation, the fulfilling of a lifetime goal grants the player a very large amount of lifetime points as opposed to the normal wishes. These lifetime points are used to buy numerous forms of relief including the ability to make the Sim immune to hunger. This allows the player to focus less on fulfilling the basic needs of a Sim but more on advancing his skills and socializing with neighbors, co-workers and other people in the city. The six needs themselves are the same as before including fun, hygiene and hunger.\n\nAs opposed to its predecessors, the game isn't limited to the property a Sim owns with loading times in-between traveling to other places like family retreats. Instead <i>The Sims 3</i> now simulates a full city the player's Sim is free to move around in and do what he wants, including working and socializing, but also buying groceries or books and visiting classes to further advance his personal skills. However, not every house can be seen from the inside. While the gym functions like a normal house with the ability to remove the walls and look inside, other places including the workplace, book store and hospital the Sim just enters and vanishes until his duty has been fulfilled there. The only influence the player can make in case of the workplace is how his Sim should go about his work. Should he work through lunch, get friendly with the boss or talk to his co-workers and such. All this influences both his happiness and his job performance and once his job performance reaches a certain level, he get's promoted which includes a higher pay and sometimes different work hours. during his visits the Sim can also collect stones, gems, metals, bugs, butterflies and seeds to be used in his garden, as decoration or jewelery. If he is really bored he can even go fishing at one of the lakes and rivers.\n\nWith the money a Sim starts with and earns during the game, he either buys a pre-created lot or builds/expands his own house from ground up including all of the interior decoration. This time around stuff can even be placed in an 45\u00b0 angle.\n\nThe console versions introduce karma powers where players receive godlike powers to influence the life of their sims for better or worse.",

      "description": "<i>The Beatles: Rock Band</i>  is the second released game in the Rock Band series to focus on a specific band, following the AC/DC Live: Rock Band  release.\n\nThe title borrows features from the Rock Band 2 game, but offers a revamped career mode, with the opportunity to play a story mode going through the different Beatles eras, with specific songs and venues, from The Cavern Club to their rooftop performance on top of Apple Corps' studio.  Whilst the game attempts to capture the spirit of significant periods in the band's history some liberties were taken in the presentation; for example Ringo Starr is shown playing the drums on Back in the U.S.S.R. despite not appearing on the actual recording and the studio versions of songs are used in the Live at the Budokan section. Along with the now classic guitar, bass, drums, and vocals parts, the title adds the possibility to have three separate vocals parts, where each singer gets to sing in a different harmony.\n\nThe game features 45 remastered Beatles titles, and further albums will be released, available for purchase through DLCs and exclusive to <i>The Beatles: Rock Band</i>. This is the first time that Apple Corps allowed the Beatles\u2019 music to feature in a video game.\n\nContrary to the AC/DC game which looked just like the original Rock Band, the entire game is skinned in a Beatles theme: characters, overall look and feel, sound effects. Skinned instruments were also released. Also still contrary to the AC/DC game, it is not possible to export the songs to play in Rock Band or Rock Band 2.\n\nThe tracklist:\n\n<b>Singles</b><ul>\n<li>I Want to Hold Your Hand</li>\n<li>I Feel Fine </li>\n<li>Day Tripper</li>\n<li>Paperback Writer</li>\n<li>Revolution</li>\n<li>Don't Let Me Down</li></ul><b>Please Please Me (1963)</b><ul>\n<li>I Saw Her Standing There</li>\n<li>Boys </li>\n<li>Do You Want to Know a Secret</li>\n<li>Twist and Shout</li></ul>\n<b>With the Beatles (1963)</b><ul>\n<li>I Wanna Be Your Man</li></ul>\n<b>A Hard Day's Night (1964)</b><ul>\n<li>A Hard Day's Night</li>\n<li>Can't Buy Me Love</li></ul>\n<b>Beatles For Sale (1964)</b><ul>\n<li>Eight Days a Week</li></ul>\n<b>Help!

      "description": "The player's goal in <i>Need for Speed: SHIFT</i> is to take part in the Need for Speed World Tour and become the ultimate champion. As opposed to its predecessors, this doesn't mean racing around an open-world city with pimped cars. Instead the game is more similar to GRID with races taking place on closed city circuits or even famous race tracks like the Circuit de Spa-Franchorchamps.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, the player drives a test-round as well as a race. During this tutorial the game evaluates the player's skill and changes the realism settings accordingly ranging from the usual arcade-style controls with many driving aids to an almost realistic simulation-like driving model. Then the main game begins where the player has to successfully earn stars in order to unlock the next tier and ultimately gain access to the World Tour. Stars are earned by getting on the podium at the end of a race as well as by fulfilling certain objectives on the track. These range from simply gaining a specific amount of points in the race to more challenging objectives like driving a clean lap. Points on the other hand are earned by the player through his driving style and are separated into two groups: Precision and Aggression. While the first group honors clean sectors or driving on the race line, aggression-points are earned by hitting other cars or sliding through curves. Once the player has earned enough points (both categories are summed-up at the end of an event, he gains a level and by doing so unlocks new upgrades for his car, get's a big money bonus or receives an invite to a special race event. To keep the player even more motivated, tons of badges are waiting to be earned which are in part also the same as the available achievements/trophies. Again actions like performing 25 overtakes or winning three consecutive races are needed to earn a minor badge. If he keeps his streak up or has earned all the minor badges in one category, he earns additional badges ranging from bronze to epic.\n\nThe available events include normal races in various variations, a time attack mode, a car attack in which the player needs to be either five seconds in front of his opponent or get 1st place in order to win and drift events. The car park includes many licensed cars from normal middle to high class vehicles to high-powered racing cars which can all be bought through the money earned by winning races or leveling up. In addition the look of the car can be changed by unlocking new vinyls. Also available are extensive upgrade and tuning options allowing the player to change every detail on his car down to the tire pressure.",

      "description": "Your Dad just got you an RC Helicopter. Play with it, or take it outside to complete various missions for friends and family. The missions range from cutting the grass in your backyard, to filming ghosts. With each mission, you earn points to upgrade your helicopter, (or even get new helicopters) and unlock more missions. Just be careful; your helicopter is somewhat fragile, and has a limited battery life.\n\n<i>RC Helicopter</i> is a flight simulator of radio-controlled toy helicopters originally released as part of the <i>Simple 1500</i> budget line in Japan. The helicopter is maneuvered with the analog sticks of the DualShock controller. The left stick controls the movement while the right stick makes the aircraft go up and down. A battery meter and a hit counter at the top right corner show the remaining energy left and the number of bumps that the helicopter can sustain. When the battery is drained or the machine received too many hits, the game is over and the mission has to be restarted.\n\nThe main objective is to complete all the missions available from the city map screen. At the beginning of each one, a character asks the player to perform a specific task with the helicopter. In some cases, the toy is equipped with special tools to complete the mission, like a squirt gun and a claw that can be activated by pressing the R1 shoulder button. In the first missions, the aircraft has to be used to transport soda cans to a garbage pail, cut grass with its blades, splash birds with the water gun, blow baseballs from a roof, recover document folders from train tracks and other challenges.\n\nAfter completing a mission the characters give money as a reward, that can used to repair any damage to the helicopter and recharge its batteries. The mission money can also be spent on items from the RC shop. The player can purchase new helicopter models and upgrades, like a more resilient body for the machine, and more durable batteries.",

      "description": "Skira is a lovely little island in the Pacific Ocean just north of Japan and was always the center of many conflicts because of its strategic value. Sadly, nice beaches and crystal blue water isn't the only thing Skira has to offer. After the second world war, the Russians managed to gain control over the island and found a huge oil deposit of a size similar to the ones in the middle east. No one cared at first but China's economy grew and grew and with it their need for oil. Then the recession hit. China's manufacturing industry was especially affected and civil unrest got stronger and stronger bringing the country closer and closer to a civil war. Because of these riots the National People's Army guarding the Russian border under the lead of General Zhang was put on high alert, further increasing the tension between China and the international community. As Russia was preparing for the worst-case-scenario, General Zhang suddenly invaded Skira saying that the island is the rightful historical property of China. Since Russia is too busy preparing for a possible war against China on the ground, they ask the USA for assistance in regaining control over the island. Soon afterwards UH-10 Black Hawks are sighted over Skira and in one of those helicopters: the player.\n\n<i>Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising</i> is an action-orientated military-simulation. The player moves through the mission areas in a typical first-person-shooter fashion and has to fulfill certain objectives like blowing up a generator or taking out anti-air-guns in order for the invasion to move along. But since realism plays an important part in this game, the player can't just walk up to the enemy base and shoot everyone. Instead he and his three squad-mates have to use the different stances like crouching and couching to move from cover to cover in different formations and think before a bullet is fired or in short: the player needs to take a tactical approach in order to not end up dead in the high grass. To that end, he has a radial, context-sensitive menu at his disposal with which he can give specific orders to his teammates. In addition, the player can change the weapons-load-out of each team-mate (and himself) at the beginning of each mission to what best fits the situation. The armory only covers real-world weaponry like the MK16 MOD 0 Assault Rifle. If all the sneaking didn't help and combat ensues, the player has to watch both his blood- and injury-status. Depending on where and how badly he has been wounded e.g. his arm, his ability to keep his weapon straight decreases. In addition each wound causes the player to loose blood and of course once he has lost too much blood, he'll lose consciousness and the mission is over.\n\nThe game features several multiplayer-modes. The players can either take on the whole campaign together or just one mission or engage each other in \"Destruction\", which is similar to Team Deathmatch, or \"Infiltration\" in which the smaller team has to fulfill an objective while the other has to prevent it from destroying their target. As opposed to the single-player campaign where the player has only limited access to vehicles like jeeps or helicopters, the selection in multiplayer is much greater and covers everything from a HUMVEE to a AH-1 Cobra helicopter. The PC-version also includes a powerful map-editor.",

      "description": "<i>Creatures: Raised in Space</i> is essentially a Playstation port of the pet simulator game Creatures 3, with modified gameplay mechanics. As in the previous titles, the player controls a fairy named Scrubby, who acts through the cursor issuing orders to the Norns when used over interactive portions of the scenery. Like in other life simulation games with artificial intelligence, the creatures can't be commanded directly and must learn behavior patterns through repeated actions. The Norns can get sick or exhausted and eventually die, and one of the main tasks is to manage the colony to avoid their demise, ensuring that all its inhabitants are well-fed and healthy by eating fruits and consuming medicinal herbs. A series of meters at the bottom of the screen show the population status.\n\nThe game takes place in space, inside a giant station with a domed ceiling protecting a closed ecosystem. The main objective is to open all the rooms, by ordering a Norn to carry a key to unlock a door or passage. Deeper levels have aggressive enemies and poisonous plants that have to be avoided by the Norns. There are blue stars scattered throughout the scenery, and the creatures can be trained to fetch and store them inside a machine, generating a new key after twenty-five stars. Norns can breed and lay eggs, producing offspring that takes some minutes to reach maturity.",

      "description": "<i>Guitar Hero 5</i> is the fifth main game in the musical rhythm series. Similar to the previous title, Guitar Hero: World Tour, the focus is on a band-experience, with a lead and bass guitar, drums and vocals. The title is available standalone or bundled with the instruments.\n\nNext to a new soundtrack with 85 songs, many animated lead singers are now modelled after famous musicians such as Johnny Cash, Carlos Santana, Shirley Manson, Kurt Cobain, and Matthew Bellamy. Players can still compose their own songs in the included studio and the game relies heavily on downloadable content, through tracks and full albums. A portion of the songs of <i>Guitar Hero: World Tour</i>, Guitar Hero Smash Hits and Band Hero can be imported in exchange for a small fee per song.\n\nIn the Band Lobby players can assemble a party of local and remore players to form a band, play the Career mode or opt for Quickplay. Most of the competitive multiplayer modes are carried over from former versions, along with two new ones: Party Play (random song selection with the option to join and leave at will using any instrument) and RockFest, a band mode for up to four (local) or up to eight (online) players with a variety of submodes. The songs are divided in smaller portions and for each section the players are rewarded based on a variety of conditions.\n\nGeneral new features introduced to the gameplay include drop-in/drop-out play, where it is possible to join in the middle of a song or stop playing without interrupting gameplay. There is also a new Challenges section in the Career mode.\n\nThe different game versions are identical, except for the PS2 version that lacks online game modes and downloadable content, drop-in/drop-out play and song challenges. It is also limited to two instruments and the multitap is not supported. The Wii version is very similar to the major console versions, including downloadable content on SD cards, multiplayer through the global Wii address book, and the Mii Freestyle mode from the previous game. It also supports interaction with the Nintendo DS to edit videos and provides access to the Roadie Battle mode, similar to the main battle mode of Guitar Hero III, where players complete mini-games on the Nintendo DS to sabotage the players on the console.",

      "description": "As it's predecessor, the racing-game <i>DiRT 2</i> doesn't just focus on accurately simulating the Rallye-sport like the earlier installments of the Colin McRae-Series did. Instead eight types of Offroad-events await the player during the main campaign called DiRT Tour:\n<ul><li><b>Rallye</b> - The player has to get as fast as possible to the finish line. He's the only one on the course at the same time and instead has to deal with hairpin curves and difficult terrain.</li>\n<li><b>Trailblazer</b> - Basically the same as Rallye but instead of narrow courses, this mode features long and open stages.</li>\n<li><b>Raid</b> - Races over wide and open terrain with many dangerous shortcuts allowing the player to get distance between him and the other drivers.</li>\n<li><b>Landrush</b> - All drivers start at the same time and the tracks are littered with crazy curves and jumps.</li>\n<li><b>Rallyecross</b> - Takes place on round-courses with a mix of dirt and asphalt streets.</li> \n<li><b>Gatecrasher</b> - The player has a limited amount of time to get to the finish line. To replenish that time, so-called gates are scattered around the track each granting +2 seconds upon destruction.</li>\n<li><b>Domination</b> - Similar to Rallye, the tracks are divided into sectors. Each sector gives 1-10 points depending on how fast the player in relation to his opponents finishes it. In addition 1-10 points are added for his final position in the race once he crosses the finish line. The winner is the driver with the most points.</li>\n<li><b>Last Man Standing</b> - As the name implies, the goal here is to race around the course and be the last car in the race at the end with the last car being removed after each lap.</li></ul>\nEach event requires either a different car or at least a so-called race-pack for that car both bought with the money earned by winning these events. Each car can be customized both visually and under the hood with parts unlocked by gaining a level. Experience points are awarded both for finishing races as well as completing missions like jumping over the finish line or getting through a race without any damage. The amount of cash earned at the end of each race, is influenced by the difficulty level. The higher the difficulty, the higher the reward. In addition the difficulty-level also changes the amount of flashbacks that are available for the race (from five to none). Flashbacks allow the player to rewind the action a few seconds when he made a mistakes or crashed and allows him to try that section again - hopefully without making the same mistake a second time.\n\nThe game features many real-world racers including their voices and their cars who give the player tips during the course of the DiRT-tour and also offer him additional challenges including duels and time trials. They'll also take part in team-events with the player, if he keeps them happy by not crashing into them that often during races.",

New to the series is the ability to choose between the simulation handling like previous games, and arcade handling, which is new for the series. As the game is predominantly a simulator, it features realistic damage models including engine damage and bullet holes on the hull of your aircraft.\n\nMultiplayer includes 4 game modes, which include Dogfight (basic death matches), Team Battle (team death matches), Capture (akin to capture the flag, in this, you have to land on an airstrip and hold it for long enough. The enemy must take you out and capture it themselves) and Strike (team game, you must destroy the enemy base before they destroy yours).\n\nPlanes featured in game include the IL-2, IL-4, Hurricane Mk II, the Spitfire Mk II, IX XVI, JU-87, and the P-51.\nYou have the option to apply different skins to these planes.\n",

      "description": "<i>Quiz World</i> in an edition in the long line of <i>Buzz!</i> quiz games. Retaining the basic concept, it includes new features such as customisable games where the player can select the rounds to play. It also features customisable profiles which enable Buzz to address/insult you personally by name. <i>Quiz World</i> also has a mini-quiz feature which has hundreds of short quizzes on a wide range of unique subjects from 'Bond, James Bond' to ' The Joke Quiz'. It also retains many of the features of previous titles, such as MyBuzz and Sofa vs Sofa, with the intention to play it with a party of friends. The following rounds are featured:<ul>\n<li>Point Builder: answer in your own time, just try and get the answer right.</li><br>\n<li>Fastest Finger: answer before everyone else to score most points.</li><br>\n<li>Stop the Clock: clock counts down from 500, the quicker you answer the more points you get.</li><br>\n<li>Pie Fight!: the player that answers first gets control of the pie. They can then throw the pie at whoever they want. If you are hit by the pie twice then you are out.</li><br>\n<li>On the Spot: one player is chosen to answer a question and the other players have to vote whether they think that player will get it wrong or right. The more unlikely they think it is the more of the player\u2019s points they are betting. If they get it right they win that amount of points, if they get it wrong they lose that amount.</li><br>\n<li>Pass the Bomb: a bomb is passed around from player to player, answer your question fast before it blows up on you and you lose points.</li><br>\n<li>Over the Edge: if you answer correctly first then you make the other players podiums rise. When they get to the top they are thrown into a pool of green gunge. If you get it wrong then your podium will rise. The players that stay out of the gunge for the longest win the most points.</li><br>\n<li>Boiling Point: if a player answers correctly then the thermometer behind them increases in temperature. The first player to fill their thermometer wins the most points.</li><br>\n<li>Point Stealer: the first player to answer correctly gets to chose who they want to steal points from.</li><br>\n<li>High Stakes: the players choose how many of their own points they want to bet on whether they get the question right. If you answer correctly, you win that amount; if you answer incorrectly then you lose that amount.</li><br>\n<li>The Final Countdown: this is the final round of the game. Each player's points are converted into time, the more time they have, the higher their podium. A question is asked and the podium/time ticks down. Answer correctly to raise your podium; however, a wrong answer will make it drop slightly. When a player's podium hits the bottom then they are out. The last player left in is the winner.</li></ul>",

      "description": "<i>Band Hero</i>  is a karaoke/rhythm based game, similar to the Guitar Hero games, but directed at the pop loving teenage crowd, as well as a more group based party game (unlike with guitar hero, full band instruments are included from the beginning of the series).\n\nThe instruments are the same as in the more recent GH games. You have the microphone for vocals, guitars for either lead or bass guitar and the drum kits for drumming along. Accordingly, each instrument has its own 'career' path in game.\n\nIf you are doing the vocals for your band, you have to sing along in time to the music, matching the pitch as closely as possible. Lead and bass guitar is played by holding down the fret buttons and strumming as the appropriate fret icons cross the strike line on screen. Drums are done similar to the guitars, hitting the correct drum pad's/cymbals at the correct time. The better you do, the more points you score, however if you make too many mistakes, you will fail the song.\n\nYou can either play alone on any of the instrument careers, or you can play with up to three friends on one console or online to compete with other players and bands from across the world.\n\nSongs featured include Duran Duran's <i>Rio</i>, Don McLean's <i>American Pie</i>, Evanescence's <i>Bring Me To Life</i> and Queen's <i>Crazy Little Thing Called Love</i>.",

The story takes place in a different high school (Hibikino High), and the protagonist's suggested main love interest is Hikari Hinomoto, whom he meets again after the two were separated since they were eight years old.\n\nLike its predecessor, <i>Tokimeki Memorial 2</i> is a simulation of dating. The player character possesses statistics, which includes general attributes such as health and charisma,  as well as school subject-specific parameters (literature, arts, science, etc.). Beside those personal statistics, there are also indicators concerning the relationship the protagonist is having with one of the girls. The focus of the gameplay is to arrange the hero's statistics in such a way that the result will attract the girl. Statistics can be raised by dedicating time and effort to corresponding activities (such as attending literature class and reading in order to raise the literature parameter). The player character can also participate in various school club activities, which might affect his attraction level to different girls.",

The pinball tables have various American themed designs, which include Surf King, Western Sheriff, Horror and Baseball.

      "description": "<i>MLB Front Office Manager</i> is a managerial simulation where the player is responsible for the athletic and financial success of his baseball team. As with most non-German games of this genre the financial aspect is limited to player trading and hiring players through free agents. The player spends the most time with his team: line-up, studying extensive statistics (divided over many menus in a big font) and tactics. The matches are shown in a 3D presentation and the player can give commands to his athletes.\n\nBefore starting his career the player can choose his former profession which influences his stats, e.g. a former scout has a good eye for talents. With successes the player gains experience points which improve his stats. Besides the usual 30-year career there are three fantasy playing modes: In \"Rotisserie\" the championship is not solely based on the athletic success of the team but in the personal ranking of the player in certain categories, in \"Head-to-Head\" the player changes his team multiple times during a season and in the third finances play absolutely no role. There is also an online-league.",

      "description": "<i>Rock Band 3</i> is the third game in the main Rock Band series, and features numerous new additions to the original game.  As with previous games in the series, players form a band (of up to seven players) and perform a song together using guitar, bass, drums, vocals (solo or harmonies) and new to this game, keyboard.  By working together, players can maximise their scores.  Each player can fill a power bar by performing special sets of notes.  When they have enough of these, they can activate \"Overdrive\" which adds a x2 multiplier for each player that has Overdrive activated simultaneously (so, for example, having four players with Overdrive activate will score you x8 rather than x2 for only one person).\n\nVocal harmonies, first introduced in The Beatles: Rock Band, are carried over into the main <i>Rock Band</i> series for the first time.  Up to three players can perform on the microphone, with one player performing the lead, and the remaining players performing backing vocals.  By keeping in harmony with each other, players can earn double or triple score, depending on how many players can keep up.  The game also introduces a new style of play for each of the instruments, \"Pro Mode\".  Pro Mode is more accurate to actual instruments for those players who are looking for an even greater challenge - guitars have multiple buttons on the fret board and players must actually strum strings, the drums must have the three cymbal attachment, while with the keyboard, even more keys are used so that the performance is much closer to actual play.\n\nThe Career Mode of the game has also been revised for this game.  Rather than grinding to earn money to unlock new items, the game is instead based around Achievement-like \"goals\".  Each goal you unlock earns you more fans for your band, and often unlocks new items of clothing or instruments.  All songs are initially unlocked so that those who just want to play for fun can, while those looking for a deeper experience can tackle the \"Road Challenge\" mode, which has you travelling to different venues and performing song sets.  Each star you earn for a song gets transformed into \"Spades\" at the end of the performance, and the more Spades you earn, the more goals you unlock which again translates into even more fans and items.  Bonus Spades can be earned by performing the requested tasks at the start of each song, such as continuously deploying Overdrive, performing note streaks while you're in the spotlight, or deploying Overdrive when full and then performing note streaks.",

With a large 50-stage story mode, players take control of Nikki and must manage time and products to keep grocery stores stocked for customers.  Besides just working to keep stores stocked, players have to deal with a competing grocery store.  By working with speed and dedication, players earn enough cash to upgrade their grocery stores to better compete with the rival store.  \n\nBesides the large story mode, the game also features an alternate \"Endless Shift\" mode with bonuses, five total shops, and seven different types of customers.  <i>Supermarket Mania</i> features over a dozen different products to manage, and over twenty upgrades for the stores.  \n\nGameplay is seen and controlled on the bottom (touch) screen of the Nintendo DSi, and the game is viewed from an isometric angle similar to classic Sims games or old PC strategy titles.  The top screen is largely used for statistics and other information.\n\n",

      "description": "<i>Gran Turismo 5</i> is the sixth iteration of Sony's flagship racing franchise developed by Polyphony Digital. The game is the sequel to the PS2 title Gran Turismo 4 and the full version of Gran Turismo 5: Prologue.\n\n<i>GT5</i> comes equipped with many new features and enhancements. The game includes more than 1,000 licensed cars for players to use and more than 20 tracks. 200 of these cars are known as premium models, which have fully rendered interior designs and fully fledged mechanical and body damage. For the first time, the <i>Gran Turismo</i> series includes the famous car brands of Ferrari, Bugatti, and Lamborghini. Special events allow players to participate in racing events like NASCAR, WRC, Super GT, and even kart-racing. Players can learn how to race on the Daytona International Speedway by NASCAR driver Jeff Gordon or even be taught how to successfully navigate the complex N\u00fcrburgring racetrack. A-Spec and B-Spec game modes return as the main single-player modes. In A-Spec, players can race through a series of different events in which they need certain cars in order to participate in. The series begin in the easy Beginner levels where races can take 5 minutes all the way up to the Endurance levels where races can range from 3 to 24 hours. In the B-Spec mode, players become the race crew chief and tell their driver to do things such as slow the pace while driving or overtake an opponent.\n\nThe game includes an all new vehicle physics and graphics engine which allows for cars to show real-time damage and wear. Damage modeling is increased as the player gains levels in the A-Spec game mode. Graphical enhancements include smoke from tires, sparks, skid-marks, and dirt collecting on the cars (which can be washed at the car wash). Dynamic weather makes its first appearance felt with the ability to race not only in the pouring rain but also in a blanket of white-covered snow. This is paired up with a day and night cycle that can be seen in the longer races. Your cars in the game can also be upgraded at the Tuning Shop. Things like weight reduction, turbo kits, and a fully customizable transmission can all be installed to improve a car.\n\nPlayers can join up with friends and play in the new online mode. Using cars that have been unlocked, the player can race in a public lobby of up to 16 players or create their own private lobby of up to 32. You can also share photos that you have taken in the Photo Mode with friends and let them drive your personally tuned cars in their own game. Tracks created in the Course Maker can also be shared.\n\nAdded in patch 1.05, Seasonal Races are a series of special races that are added to on a bi-weekly basis. Some are one-make races with strict tuning limits, while others are time and drift trials that pit the player against the rest of the world. A special Online Dealership has a selection of uncommon standard cars which is updated along with the Seasonal Races, and is usually a good place to find a car for them. As of patch 1.10 Seasonal Races also reward helmets and racing suits that can be equipped by the player or B-Spec drivers to change their look.\n\n<i>Gran Turismo 5</i> is compatible with Gran Turismo. Cars obtained in the PSP game can be uploaded and used in the arcade mode of <i>GT5</i>.",

      "description": "The protagonist of the game is a Japanese high school student, who was frequently transferred from school to school in various cities of Japan. During the summer holidays, he receives an anonymous letter, containing only one sentence: \"I want to meet you\". He decides to travel to all the cities where he attended high school, and resume the contact with the girls who could have sent him this letter. But which one did send it, and which one is going to be his true love?..\n\n<i>Sentimental Graffiti</i> is what is usually referred to as <i>dating simulation</i>. Instead of following a story, like in adventure games, the player makes choices that influence his relationships with the game's female characters, thus shaping his own story. \n\nThere are twelve cities to travel to, and twelve girls to have a relationship with. Compared to some other dating simulations (such as  Tokimeki Memorial  games), the gameplay system in <i>Sentimental Graffiti</i> is rather simple, focusing on freedom of movement and choice rather than statistics. \n\nThe player can choose between various means of transportation (different kinds of train, plane, boat, etc.), and different locations within each city. The backgrounds are digitized photos of real locations in Japan, while the characters are hand-drawn anime style pictures.",

      "description": "EA's 2010-2011 release in their NCAA Football series focuses on recreating the unique nuances of each of the 120 schools in the NCAA.  Playbooks, stadiums, mascots, traditional team strengths, tendencies, and even locker room rituals are included with as much accuracy as possible.  Games also use a complete ESPN broadcast package, including graphics, fly-ins, and replays. Broadcasters Kirk Herbstreit, Brad Nessler, and reporter Erin Andrews offer commentary and sideline updates throughout each game. The lighting engine has also been improved for all on-field conditions.\n\nGameplay improvements target A.I. and physics.  The Locomotion and Pro-Tak systems from the Madden series moves to NCAA in this release, basing the success of the running game and tackles more on physics and momentum, and less on arbitrary player stats.  Players can also use the analog sticks for precision running, with direction on the left, and spins, jukes, and stiff-arms on the right.  A.I. has been updated to run its assignments more effectively, and utilize new routes and concepts like double-blocking.\n\nAlso in <i>NCAA 11</i> is expanded use of social media and online integration.  Players can run all aspects of their Dynasty online, and keep up with their team's performance.  The Team Builder returns from NCAA Football 10 with expanded options; allowing players to go online and build a team from uniform color to on-field logo, and then share their teams online for public or private download.  Players can also use the StoryBuilder online feature to package clips, shots, and results from games into news stories that can be published on Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter.\n\nMultiplayer uses EA's Online Pass system, and requires a code from a new copy of the game, or one purchased through XBL/PSN, to use any of the online features.\n\n",

      "description": "<i>Apache Air Assault</i> is a helicopter flight simulation. The player takes control of an AH-64 combat helicopter and fulfills a variety of missions in three different scenarios. The settings include Eastern Europe, Africa and South America. Each scenario has a different storyline, revolving around the pilot and the gunner of each battleship.\n\nThe player's campaign missions usually consist of seek and destroy objectives, as well as the occasional air support deployments to protect allied vehicles and ground troops. The weapon load-out varies from helicopter to helicopter and includes guided hellfire missiles, hydra rockets, anti-air missiles and the built-in machine gun turret. The turret can be controlled either by an AI gunner, manually during flight or by switching to a black and white gun camera that includes an infrared view for better spotting of ground troops. Countermeasures against incoming missiles are available and deployed automatically. A great amount of decals can be unlocked by completing certain mission objectives or attempting higher difficulties. Four of these decals can be applied to each helicopter skin in the hangar.\n\nIn the multiplayer modes, players are able to fly Mil Mi-24 Hind and small helicopter drones as well. Various mission objectives exist that include races with aerial checkpoints and coop objectives, where one player controls a drone and marks target, while the other player flies the Apache and destroys the marked objects.",

But racing is not the only thing the player needs to keep in mind: press interviews influence his reputation and becoming the first driver of the team means he has a higher saying in the team's strategic decisions. He may even choose to negotiate a contract with another team.\n\nBesides the full weekend with training, qualifying and the race there is also a shorter weekend available. In the workshop the player can tune his car or choose between pre-defined configurations.",

      "description": "<i>DiRt 3</i> is a rally racing game. Just like expected, most time is spent in races which, at least in most scenarios, are set in offroad environments. The main difference to other racing events is, that the player drives not alone, but has a front-seat passenger with him, who announces when to turn. The game features overall 98 courses, but some of those are just variations of the same. Also on board is the iconic ability to turn back time after screwing up.\n\nIn contrast to DiRt 2, in this installment there are other playing modes than the career available, e.g. a single race. But the career is still the heart of the game; here the player tunes his car, participates in races and earns experience points, which are used to unlock new cars. There are six different race modes to solve during the career; e.g. regular races and \"trailblazer\" (no passenger available). Two of those are newly introduced: drift tournaments and Gymkhana, which are basically confined areas with a lot of stunt opportunities - the goal is to perform as many as possible in a limited time. Additionally every mode has special tricky bonus goals which reward more experience when fulfilled.",

      "description": "<i>Yoostar 2: In the Movies</i> is the sequel to the 2009 PC application Yoostar: Be Scene. It is a movie karaoke game where players can act out 80 famous scenes from movies such as <i>300</i>, <i>The Matrix</i>, <i>The Godfather</i>, <i>Kindergarten Cop</i>, <i>Shaun of the Dead</i>, <i>The Terminator</i>, <i>Frankenstein</i>, <i>The Wizard of Oz</i> and many more. The game uses a rotoscoping technique to filter out the original actors and replace them with the player's image. The game requires a camera function through Kinect (Xbox 360) or PlayStation Eye (PS3) to capture the player, with optional support for Move on the PS3.\n\nThe player is put inside the scene and needs to imitate the original motions as well as speak out the lines. Players can either act out the scenes straight or improvise their own lines. The game grades the player based on the imitation of motion and gestures (a silhouette outlines where you should stand in the screen), as well as the rhythm of speaking the lines, similar to the SingStar games. In the Challenge mode there are additional goals while acting out the scenes. Clips can be saved and shared on the Yoostar website, as well as on Facebook and Twitter. Additional movie content is available as DLC.",

The game can be played with a standard controller, or with the Cabela's Top Shot Elite gun peripheral.  When played with a controller, the game operates in much the same way as a standard modern First-Person Shooter.  \n\nThe story is centered around a hunting tournament, in which the player is one of the participants.  Each level features three hunts with a variety of animals and challenges, as well as bonus challenges.  A hunt may include shooting a red deer, but the bonus may be to shoot it in the heart.  Each stage features ample chatter among the participants in the tournament, which is where the bulk of the story is told.  Hunts take place in areas all over the world, including Montana and Nigeria, and there are three levels pertaining to each location.\n\nBesides the Story Mode, there are a variety of shooting galleries listed as Arcade, Reflex, and Target.  Arcade is simply to score the highest points, Reflex is to hunt animals in a specific order, and Target galleries are simple shooting range style affairs with wooden \"pop-up\" animals and clay pigeons to shoot.",

      "description": "<i>The Price is Right: Decades</i> is a video game based on the popular TV show \"The Price is Right\".  It is the third \"Price is Right\" video game developed by Ludia Inc. for Wii and the first for Xbox 360, but the very first to allow players to play as their Mii characters/Xbox Avatars instead of Ludia avatars.  It is also the first game of the series that is completely rendered in 3D.\n\nThe game starts in a backstage lounge, where the player is asked to help the lovely Jessica, one of the \"beauties\" from the show, to go through a series of \"The Price is Right\" VHS tapes.  Jessica will put the tapes in the VCR and the player will be transported into the show, where he/she will bid on several items and compete against other players to win fabulous prizes and money.\n\nIn single player mode, the player will first go to Contestants' Row and bid on the selected item against 3 NPCs.  If the player's bid is the closest to that item's retail price, without going over, he/she will then go on to play a pricing game.  The player will then go to the Showcase Showdown to spin the wheel.  If the player beats the NPC's best score while spinning the wheel (by landing on the highest number, without going over 1$), he or she will then go to the Showcase, just like on the TV show.\n\nIn multiplayer mode, up to four players can compete against each other on Contestants' Row, pricing games, Showcase Showdown and the Showcase. The player with the most money wins.\n\n<i>The Price is Right: Decades</i> features pricing games from four different decades; the 70s, the 80s, the 90s and the 2000s decade.  Each decade's set from the TV show has been faithfully recreated in 3D.  There is one pricing game for every year the show has been on air, up until the year 2010. Among the included pricing games are Professor Price, Plinko, Hole in One, Golden Road, Spelling Bee, Rat Race, Pathfinder, and many others. The Xbox 360 version is also compatible with Kinect and features an online mode.",

      "description": "<i>NASCAR: Unleashed</i> is a racing game based on the US stock car racing sports event. Rather than a true simulation, it espouses realistic control, driving, and physics for much more hectic and over-the-top arcade racing, complete with many typical arcade racing features such as boosting and drifting, and the like. It has several features from both simulator-style racing games (e.g. NASCAR 09) and from arcade racing games (such as Burnout). Authentic NASCAR tracks are present in the game, but most \"break out\" from the track and into the surrounding city area, hence the \"Unleashed\" aspect. Pit lanes remain and are important for vehicle repairs and obtaining Slingshot boosts. A 15-driver \"All-Stars\" list of NASCAR drivers and their cars is present in the game, though all control identically. Drafting (lowering air resistance, and increasing speed by driving behind other cars) is also present.\n\nBesides drifting and boosting, the game features wild arcade-infused physics which often see cars barrel-rolling through the air, and collisions are rampant.  Cars can be wrecked and players will routinely create Rivals, who become much more aggressive opponent racers.  Should the player be wrecked, he has the ability to perform a Payback wreck on the Rival.\n\nThe boost meter is filled through extremely aggressive driving, slamming other cars, wrecking other cars, drifting, and drafting. Filling the boost meter gives the player the ability to use a Slingshot boost to race quickly around opponents, and the time limit on a boost tends to depend on the skill of a player to maintain the car around obstacles, walls, and other cars.\n\nChallenges routinely present themselves during each race. Completing challenges adds to the boost meter, and are occasionally part of secondary race challenges.  An in-race challenge may be as simple as reaching a certain position in the race or destroying obstacles on the tracks, or may require a bit more attention, such as creating Rivals or performing successful drifts.\n\nThe included game modes are:<ul>\n<li><i>Championship</i> - The standard career mode with three tiers of difficulty where the player progresses through several races with the goal of finishing within a specific place such as placing in the top 12 or top 5.  Each track features two secondary challenges such as creating a set number of Rivals or performing a set number of Drifts.  Can be played by one or two players.</li><br>\n<li><i>Quick Race</i> - Simple races that can be performed on any track, or in small, player-created career-style modes.  Only tracks unlocked in Championship mode can be used, and this mode can be played by one or two players.</li><br>\n<li><i>Time Trials</i> - The standard, basic Time Trial mode of a typical racing game.  The player only races against the clock, but there are several checkpoints available where boosts (Slingshots) can be obtained.</li></ul>",
