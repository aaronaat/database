      "description": "After the 20th century, humankind reaches its hand out across the stars. Seeking to escape the overcrowded chaos of Earth, the United Nations builds a single seedship, the UNS Unity, and sends her on a mission towards the Alpha Centauri star system. After a long journey in cryogenic suspension, the Unity reaches Alpha Centauri where the Captain is killed under mysterious circumstances. Suspecting the motives of one another, the officers and the crew split into 7 factions, each lead with a distinct ideology and motives that they seek to build the planet in their image...\n\n<i>Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri</i> is best compared to Civilization II, but features many distinct differences in gameplay and thinking. In Civilization, the objective was to evolve a society from primitive tribes, whereas Alpha Centauri starts with the landing of colony pods on a barren planet with society becoming fractured. Each faction (aka nation) receives it's own share of the Unity's resources and tech base. For the basics, bases produce nutrients, materials and energy. Nutrients are required to feed to population, Materials are used in production and energy represents the commerce effect which can be traded to players diplomatically or spent on improvements. The 7 factions each have their own agenda, which is determined in large part by the Social Engineering. This enables a faction to customize its values, earning a bonus for what it considers important and a penalty for what it doesn't. Social Engineering system are discovered through research, the same as other improvements, such as structures and units.\n\nResearch is divided into 4 types of technologies, which form an intertwining tree of dependencies. They are: Conquer (direct military applications), Explore (indirect technologies for units and bases), Build (direct infrastructure application) and Discovery (Science for the sake of science, indirect applications). Because of the separation, factions can focus on what they hope the intended result of their science will be, and can be changed at any time. To explore the planet, units are needed. Any unit can be customized out of known technologies; consisting of a chassis type, reactor, weapon, armor and special abilities. Each of these components has a different expense, with untested technologies having additional overhead (prototype). \n\nFinally, Alpha Centauri is not a desolate star system. There is life on the planet, in the form of alien fungus that litters the ground and strange creatures such as mindworms. Initially hostile to all factions, this form of life holds its own secrets and effects on the world at large.\n",

      "description": "Starting out with just a single unit and knowledge of a small local area, your challenge is to guide your civilization into becoming the dominant force, either by conquering every other civilization or by sending a spaceship to Alpha Centauri.\n\nAs you'd imagine, a lot of challenges come into such a task. You must locate cities so as to make use of food, construction and trade resources, which can be later improved by constructing irrigation, roads, mines, railroads, and farmland. Each city can construct one item at a time - civilian and military units, buildings or Wonders of the World (there are 28 of these across the different eras of the game, and each can be possessed by only one city). The buildings and wonders have different effects - most buildings and some wonders improve defenses, scientific research, trade or food output, but most wonders offer unique advantages that can be used to great strategic effect.\n\nThere are over 100 scientific advancements in the game, and most require prerequisites before they can be researched. How quickly this happens depends on your scientific output, which must be traded off against financial and military concerns.\n\nCombat can occur in cities or in the open terrain - things like forests and mountains give the defense an advantage. Unlike in the original Civilization, fights aren't always won outright - most times the winning unit will be damaged, reducing its movement speed and attacking prowess until it's repaired, but the losing unit always disappears from game. If multiple units are in a square that come sunder attack, the strongest unit fights - unless it is a city or Fortress, all units will be lost if the fight is lost. Once a city has no defensive units left, it can be captured. Certain units have the ability to cover all squares as fast as if they were roads, only a few can see submarines, and air units require re-fueling in a friendly city.\n\nThere are up to 6 other Civilizations in the game, and keeping good diplomatic relations with these is crucial. At times you may want to trade knowledge or pool military resources with a neighbor - at others they may want to destroy you. If you make deals and go back on them your reputation is affected.",

However, in the 21st Century time travel has been mastered, as have jet-propulsion backpacks, plus some cataclysmic weaponry and advanced code-breaking equipment. These items are sent back in time to you in order to change the result of the war by using this technology to find their five rocket factories and destroy the moon base.\n\nThe game fits the Cinemaware template closely, with a string of action sequences linked by cinematic animation sequences to set the scene. There's also a strategic element, as you move your spies around to gain information and avoid detection, and decide how much Lunarium to use at each stage of the game. Action sequences include hand-to-hand combat with a Nazi guard, and flying through the air shooting either hordes of enemy planes or the Zeppelin itself.\n\nAn \"Extended Collector's Edition\" of the game was released in 2018. It is a limited edition of 500 and contains the game in multiple languages and for multiple platforms, and contains as bonuses posters, stickers, postcards, and the soundtrack on vinyl.",

Battle plague-ridden corpses who detonate themselves in ground-shaking explosions, throngs of axe-wielding zombies, floating spectors who hurl poisoned spears at you, and quick-moving magical creatures armed with sharp blades. Live long enough and you will face the most powerful of the Fallen Lords.\r\n\r\nTake control of the high ground and your ranged attackers will be able to shoot farther distances, but the enemy can take advantage of the same situation. Sometimes it may be to your advantage to let the forces of evil thin their ranks for you...\r\n\r\nGo online and play vs other humans, using either side you wish, in many modes of play, including a game of capture the flag, but with a ball instead.",

The Saxons and the Normans blame each other and fight for control of England.\n\nAfter a short introduction by Robin of Locksley himself, the game starts with a single castle and 10 soldiers at your command. From there, you have to build your army, take control of additional territories and fight and defeat the three Norman lords - and sometimes your Saxon friends as well.\n\nIn addition to the basic 'build your army and conquer your opponents' the game offers several events and options that can be used to fine tune your play style: You may  engage in a jousting contest where you have to knock your opponent off his horse, gaining either fame or land, or you can go raid a castle for loot or the hand of a princess, joining your houses and territories.

Created by the Ancients, it remains unclaimed due to a powerful Guardian that orbits the planet and keeps out intruders. These same Ancients long ago fought a war against the Antarans and banished them into another dimension. Now... long after the Ancients empire has vanished, new races take to the stars, wishing to establish their own star empires, defeat the Antarans and become... The Master of Orion.\n\n<i>Master of Orion II: Battle At Antares</i> is a turn-based 4x space empire game and is the sequel to Master of Orion, reinterpreting that game from scratch. Unlike the original the game can be played single player or with other human players. The player takes the role of a ruler of one of thirteen races, while also having the extra option of creating a custom one. They must manage planet resources to build ships and facilities, improving production. Exploration of the galaxy is done via scouts and colony ships, which can establish new planets as part of the empire. Research must also be done to discover and utilize new technologies. Alien civilizations which are encountered can be negotiated with, or ships can engage in combat in a turn-based grid system. As new systems are explored, random events are triggered and strange artifacts found in orbit around unexplored planets. Wormholes can also be found which allow transport across dozens of parsecs into new star systems.\n\nThe game can be won in different ways: Through conquest of all other races, Being voted supreme leader of the galaxy or destruction of the Antarans race.",

You can do this by destroying your competing wizards (up to 4 computer players) or by casting the Spell of Mastery.\n\nGame play is carried out in a 2D top down perspective. You move your armies around the board, fighting monsters to get treasure, and more importantly 'nodes'. Once you control a node you can summon a spirit to meld with the node and gain mana from it. You also must build up your cities so you can support and train your army. City management is very much like Civilization. You also must allocate your mana for use, or research. You must research to learn new spells. You can do battle with the enemy in a quasi-isometric perspective or you can have the game simulate the battles. \n\nThe game ends when your home tower is destroyed; you banish all the other wizards (by destroying their home tower) or someone casts the Spell of Mastery.",

      "description": "<i>Afterlife</i> is is a humorous strategy game similar to SimCity where the afterlife is subject to market-based economy. The player has to make it work by managing heaven and hell simultaneously.\n\nIn both hell and heaven the player constructs zones which deal with one of the seven capital sins respectively the corresponding virtues. Through the gates new souls arrive regularly which were sinful or virtues in one specific aspect. These go to the appropriate zones to receive their gifts or punishment - but only if the player constructed a street system. If there is no place left they wander through hell/heaven which is of course bad for business. After some time they get sent back to the home planet. These souls are the source of the player's income. \n\nOf course these facilities also need personnel. These can be either hired or trained by building special training facilities. There are also additional things the player has to keep in mind, e.g. the satisfaction of each soul and the energy supply. Every buildings has to be micro-managed by adjusting their settings but there is also the possibility to use a tool which does it automatically - for a price. \n\nRandom disasters like \"Birds of Paradise\" (excrement rain down on the facilities) break the economic circle and challenge the player to repair the damage. Besides the free playing mode there are also five scenarios where the player has to solve certain tasks.",

The characters are controlled indirectly using the mouse, as you activate each soldier or group of them by highlighting them, click the left button to move them to a particular spot, and the right button for them to fire guns at an enemy. You can also pick up grenades or rockets, which can be used to destroy groups of enemies, buildings or some vehicles (by pressing both buttons at once). \n\nEach mission has a specific objective, and some feature vehicles such as tanks that used make things easier. Your troops can cross water but can't shoot within it, so finding and controlling bridges is often crucial. You can use the arrangement of trees to find hiding places to shoot from, and should watch out for CPU soldiers also doing so.",

You start out as a young lieutenant and are given a series of missions to complete. You then advance to the next rank and are given more ships to control and more available commands, but you have more area of the universe to police and more colonies. This continues until you reach the rank of Grand Admiral, where you are able to view the whole map.\n\nWhen you are in command of a region, you must worry about its economy. Ensure that taxes are collected and that the people are well-fed and reproducing. 75 new scientific discoveries can be made over the course of the game.\n\nYour enemies are a bunch of alien races. They each have their own style of architecture, ships, and land-based units. However, some are more inspired than others. Diplomacy options ensure that all-out war is not the only way to victory. In combat you have ships to protect and mercenary pirates to deal with.\n\nThere is a plot-driven interactive movie element to the game, with an opening movie, and cutscenes appearing whenever you advance in rank and also at certain other points in the game. Voices used in these are computer generated. \n\nThe player has to refit every single ship manually. The land battles resemble Command & Conquer , though with only vehicle units.",

It is your job to take control away from the competitors.  The job is not one of diplomacy, but one of brute force and physical control.  Advance your way to the top of the corporation by successfully completing your missions and managing the money you make from your territories.\n\nThe gameplay is visually reminiscent of X-Com, with an angled top-down perspective, but it is real time rather than turn based. You have missions ranging from infiltrate and capture, to seek and destroy. In each of these you direct a team of four agents as they move through the world shooting at anything that gets in their way.\n\nYou can upgrade and modify your agents, as well as equip them with tools you have researched or liberated from opposing syndicates.  As you complete missions, you gain more funds to use for purchasing agents or researching upgrades and equipment.  ",

It is 1941, and Germany is launching Operation Barbarossa: the invasion of Russia. Finally, a game that captures the magnitude of this epic, 4-year-long battle that ultimately sealed the end of the 3rd Reich! \r\n\r\nAs with the previous CC games, this one is incredibly researched. The sounds of the dozens of different weapons, the hundreds of unit types, the terrain... it is just amazing how much work went into drawing the sprites and the maps. Units can panic, be pinned, suppressed, surrender, regroup... you name it. There are flame tanks, snipers, bunkers, city fighting, winter/summer battles, different weather conditions, mine fields... pretty much anything that might normally happen on a battlefield can happen in this game. And the best parts: it covers the entire Eastern Front battle from 41-45, and it has good multiplayer support.\r\n\r\nI mean... if you play the Germans, your guys speak German, and if you play the Russians, they speak Russian. You just don't get more realistic than that. :)",

      "description": "<i>Dune 2000</i> is a remake of the classic Dune II: The Building of a Dynasty, updated for Windows. In this real-time strategy game, you can play one of the three houses: the noble Atreides, the insidious Ordos, or the evil Harkonnen. Each has different sets of units and tactics while maintaining an overall balance. The Atreides have air superiority and rely on their honor and alliance with planet natives, the Fremen. The Ordos rely on guerrilla tactics and superior technology, as well as mercenaries. The Harkonnen just go brutal, with no care for lives of their own troops or destruction, as long as they are victorious.\n\nUnlike the original, the cutscenes happen after every mission, with a live-cast this time, like already seen in Westwood Studios' Command & Conquer franchise. A 16-bit colour mode is the default setting, setting the game's graphics on par with the <i>Command & Conquer</i> games that came before it, while an 8-bit colour mode is available as an option in the game's settings.\n\nEverything from the original is back: sandworms, the spice, the Fremen, the known structures and the map of the planet, and even the intro cinematic is an enhanced live-action/CGI version of the original one.\n\nThe PlayStation port features a different engine with 3D terrain, structures and vehicles, while infantry units use adapted 2D sprites. The gameplay and storyline remain the same.",

Through a series of missions you must carefully plan your attacks, spend Resource Points wisely, and keep your people alive. \n\n<i>Mech Commander</i> is a real-time strategy game that introduces eighteen different types of mechs, several types of vehicles, repair bays, artillery barrages, mine fields, forests that you can burn down, highly explosive containers, mechs that limp when their legs are damaged, missile and autocannon turrets, and other features.\n\nDuring each mission, you can capture buildings to get weapons. You can also salvage enemy mechs if they aren't too badly damaged. You are awarded Resource Points which you can use to repair mechs and buy new mechs, weapons, and Mechwarriors. Your Mechwarriors will advance in different skills (gunnery, piloting, jumping, and sensors) as they use them in battle, They can also be injured or killed. \n\nThe opening movie features live-action acting.",

Touch the \"flag\" in the sector and it's yours. Capture the sector before the new unit comes out of the manufactory and the new unit is yours. With six different robots (different armaments, armor, and speed), multiple vehicles (from jeeps to tanks) the robots can utilize, your ultimate objective is to destroy the opponent's base, and prevent him from doing the same to you.\n\nThe game differs from many other RTSs by emphasizing territorial control (and the manufactories) instead of getting kills and gathering a big army. You have to finely balance defense and offense. If you wait too long, the enemy will grab all the manufactories first. If you go too fast, you'll get hammered for stretching yourself too thin. You can hijack enemy vehicles by shooting the driver off. If you send a group of soldiers toward an objective and they find a vehicle, one of them will split off to grab the vehicle; you don't really need to micromanage each soldier. \n",

      "description": "Things have not gone well since the last Alien War. The world resources have been exhausted, and most of the population have been concentrated into the last hope: Mega-Primus, a self-sufficient city. Things are starting look good until a strange portal opened in the sky, and UFOs emerged from it. It seems that the X-COM is needed again.\n\n<i>X-COM: Apocalypse</i> is a sequel to X-COM: Terror from the Deep, and is the third entry in the <i>X-COM</i> series. It is a real-time / turn-based strategy game that features a mix of research, resource management, macro tactical combat, and micro tactical combat. At the city screen, the player controls vehicles to engage the threats (everything from rival factions to alien UFOs). If a UFO has landed or infiltration has been reported, the vehicles will land/dock at the infestation site and engage in tactical combat with the equipment at hand. Once the player managed to capture aliens and alien equipment, the scientists can research and perhaps even copy them for the player's use. \n\nThe player will also need to balance the budget as everything costs money, from agents to equipment. The various human factions must be kept happy, otherwise they might turn against the X-COM. The player must hire recruits, buy weapons, ammo, and equipment to outfit his squads in the vehicles (including weapons on the vehicles and their ammo). The management mode for tracking down UFOs is called the Cityscape; combat takes place in a separate environment, the Battlescape, where the player engages the individual aliens that managed to escape. \n\nDifferences from the previous games in the series include reworked graphics, larger maps, a more complex world, and the possibility of choosing between real-time or turn-based tactical combat. Also, instead of just engaging aliens, the player will also have to deal with multiple human factions, from a cult that worships alien invaders to gangs, from industrial giants to security forces. \n",

      "description": "The history you knew is a lie. There was no Space Race. \n\nThe real story is simple... In 1950's, American and Soviet scientists have discovered alien bio-metal that arrived via meteorites. The bio-metal can be quickly and efficiently be turned into amazing weapons and vehicles. Soon all the bio-metal has been \"harvested\", but neither side have \"enough\". So the space program is launched to gather MORE bio-metal from the other planets... And fight over the bio-metal deposits.\n\nAnd now, you are in command of these advanced units. Can you stop the Soviet onslaught?\n\n<i>Battlezone</i> is a first-person RTS where you both command your own vehicle as well as direct other units to fight with you or do other things. You send out harvesters to scavenge bio-metal scraps, which can be turned into units via your Recycler, Mobile Unit Factory, and/or Construction Rig. You then build offensive and/or defensive units that will help you accomplish your mission, all in first-person 3D. \n\nThe interface is very intuitive. Put crosshair on unit and hit \"command\" (defaults to \"space\"). You then get menu of that unit, with a default command already selected. If you want the default command, point crosshair to target and press \"command\" again. For example, if you want the tank to attack enemy tank, point at your tank, hit command, point at enemy tank, hit command again. You can issue goto commands the same way, as well as all the other types of commands with this simple and efficient command system. \n\nYou can bail out of vehicles that is almost destroyed. You can then use your rifle (with sniper mode) to take out the enemy pilot and hijack his vehicle for your own use. You can even order your own pilot to head back to base on foot so you can grab his vehicle. \n\nYou can't expand forever as you're limited by the number of pilots you have, the amount of bio-metal you have, and the number of thermal geysers you have access to. Thus, you have to balance speed, armor, and firepower when you decide what vehicles you should manufacture. \n",

      "description": "The political situation in the democratic monarchy of Arulco has gone from bad to worse. The country has been taken over through a coup d'\u00e9tat by Queen Deidranna Reitman, the wife of Enrico Chivaldori - rightful heir and son of late King Andreas Chivaldori. Enrico was reportedly killed in an assassination attempt during his trial for the murder of his father. Enrico however is alive and has contacted the Association of International Mercenaries (A.I.M.) to help him retake the island. Making contact with Miguel Cordoba, the head of the resistance team, A.I.M. will hire mercenaries and coordinate battle plans to control towns, organize militias in a quest to overthrow Queen Deidranna.\n\n<i>Jagged Alliance 2</i> is an isometric, third-person perspective turned-based strategy game. The role-playing elements of the game refer to (mostly) character development. The game is also able to switch between two different styles: sci-fi or realistic modes. From a new game, players will use their laptop to review information and hire mercenaries. Following that, the political map shows a satellite top-down position of the island of Arulco. From the map, equipment and funds are managed, as well as a review of enemy movement, and planning can be made to capture towns, mines and other locations. From the map, mercenaries can be deployed into a specific sector. Hostile sectors and enemy counter-attacks initiate combat mode.\n\nThe combat screen is where most of the actual gameplay occurs. Traveling in towns, exploring houses (with the purpose of stealing stuff of course!) and most importantly combat, occurs here. An encounter with an enemy team (either offensive or defensive) will prompt a battle in the area of contact. If on the offensive, players may opt to place mercenaries in favorable positions. Each team plays in turns, unless their action in interrupted by an opposing member. Enemies come in all shapes and sizes: enemy soldiers, tanks, bloodcats, and (in sci-fi mode) insect-like monsters. The team that remains alive will control the sector.\n\nIn order to recapture the island, players must engage in town militia management. A defense system must be organized for newly conquered towns to defend against enemy troops. Only loyal towns however may have its population trained into militia (indicated by a green percentage on the town via political map). A maximum of 2 mercenaries may train militia in any given town. The militia has 3 different training levels: green, regular, and veteran. The first 2 may be acquired through training, while the veteran status may only be acquired through combat.",

      "description": "<i>Sid Meier's Colonization</i> is a strategy game which puts you in the role of Viceroy of the New World. You are sent by your King and country to establish colonies in the newly-discovered Americas that lie to the west. You face many of the same challenges that faced colonial organizers of the time-competition\nfrom other Old World powers, strange native cultures, the problems of establishing profitable trade programs, and the problems of organizing an army from a rag-tag band of colonists.\n\nThe game begins with the European discovery of the Americas (1500) and continues until approximately the time of the American\nRevolution (1800). In the beginning of the game you are given a trading/exploration ship and a small group of colonists. You have no knowledge of what lies ahead of your ship, so you must explore until you find a suitable spot to lay down your first colony. As your\ncolonies grow larger and larger, you inevitably encounter native populations and are confronted with competing imperial powers from the Old World.\n\nEach of your colonies is populated by a number of colonists, who you can assign to various tasks. Some chop wood, mine for ore and collect plants outside the colony, some others stay inside to turn those raw materials into more valuable cargo - such as rum (made from sugar), coats (made of furs) or hammers (made of lumber). Hammers which aren't a cargo you can sell, but represent the speed with which you construct new buildings in your colony. Some colonists are specialists, and thus are more effective at a certain job. \n\nThe cargo you collect and produce is an important thing. You can take it to Europe to sell, and earn money to buy some other necessary things, hire colonists (though new, willing colonists appear in Europe by themselves) or buy ships and artillery. You can also trade it with the Indians or colonies of other nations. \n\nYou'll construct various buildings in your colonies. They have a lot of different functions: some of them can improve the speed with which you produce valuable cargo, others allow you to defend yourself from attacks more easily or construct ships and artillery. Some buildings require you to spend a number of valuable Tools when constructed, though you can make new Tools out of ore. \n\nAs you explore the land, you'll come across the Indian villages and some \"places of interest\" which can be investigated. A colonist that enters an Indian village can be welcomed with open hands, and the natives will reveal a map of nearby lands, or teach him a profession. Investigating places of interest has various consequences: sometimes you'll find nothing, sometimes you'll be killed for trespassing on ancient burial ground, but sometimes you'll find treasure! (Taking this treasure to Europe can be difficult though - if you don't have a sufficiently big ship, the King will agree to transport it for you... if you give him 50% of the gold). \n\nTo defend yourself from enemies, you'll want to have some military units. Just give a colonist a musket and he'll turn into a Soldier, give him a horse, and he's a Scout or a Dragoon. However, such a warrior is typically inexperienced, though he might gain military experience in battle. Artillery is also good at defense, but don't try to leave your colonies with it - in the open field, it is useless. \n\nAs you progress in the game, you'll feel that working for the King is getting more and more annoying, especially since he keeps raising your taxes, thus decreasing your income from sold goods. Your colonies produce \"Liberty Bells\", which increase rebel sentiment in the colonies. If the majority of colonists supports your yearning for freedom, you can declare independence. But when you do that, you'll have to deal with the King's expeditionary force arriving to teach you a lesson. If you manage to defeat all his incoming armies and emerge victorious from the American Revolutionary War, you've won! ",

Building units requires credits and a power source, and once completed you can direct them into combat against foes.  You only know the layout of terrain you have visited, and only the exact whereabouts of enemy units which are range for one of your units, due to the Fog of War. \n\nEach of the three races has a distinct range of units and general strengths: Zerg units are quick to build, Terran units cost the least, and Protoss units are the most powerful individually.  In a change from many strategy games, the base style for each race also varies significantly, resulting in a very different playing experience with each.  Missions vary from destruction to infiltration.  Realistic line-of-sight calculations make the correct result more likely.  A full map editor is provided, with many user-created maps available online.",

The whole climate changes. The three \"states\" left on earth (and moon) try to conquer the areas which contain the resources necessary to build a huge spaceship to escape from earth.\n\nIn total there are 70 missions of non-linear real-time strategy gameplay to complete. It features a range of land, air and seas units, with some which can 'dig' tunnels through mountains so that your units can drive through it. There is also a level editor.\n\nThe game's 3D engine has realistic weather effects like fog, rain, thunderstorms etc.  The physics engine is detailed, too: if there's a crater somewhere and it starts to rain, the crater slowly fills with water .... When the sun goes down and it gets dark, all units and buildings have lights on them.",

If the player would rather get away from the historical aspect, the game offers a random terrain generator and a custom scenario builder. \n\nThe game has four resources: food, obtained by either hunting, foraging, fishing, or farming; wood, which must be logged by hand; stone, which must be mined; and gold, which can either be mined or obtained through trade with other players.\n\nAs a real-time war game, <i>Age of Empires</i> naturally revolves around gathering resources and producing units.",

However, Einstein stopped one evil only to create another - because Stalin's Soviet Union is now poised to conquer Europe... and Allies must stop them!\n\n<i>Command & Conquer: Red Alert</i> can be considered a prequel to Command & Conquer. Like its predecessor, it is a real-time strategy with an isometric semi-top-down perspective using 2D sprite graphics engine. The player takes control of either the Allies or the Soviets, as he battles for destiny of the planet. Gameplay features are similar to those of the previous game, including building a base with some defenses, massing units, harvesting resources, etc. The game has a variety of environments in its missions, adding some indoor missions that use only infantry units.",

But the pirates are, too, well-armed, and the Terra Hegemony may be involved. When the covert action turns overt and a full-out assault is mounted by the Hegemony upon Alpha Centauri. All that stands in the way is SFC.\n\n<i>Terra Nova: Strike Force Centauri</i> is a first-person sci-fi combat sim featuring realistic sci-fi weapons with true 3D terrain. You control a power-suit with arm-mounted weapons: just aim (with mouse) and shoot, while move completely independently (using keyboard). \n\nYou can choose from multiple types of suits (scout, regular, heavy), multiple types of weapons (everything from simple lasers to railguns to missile launchers), multiple assistance modules (from mine layer to auto-doc), and up to three squadmates that'll follow your orders. You are pitted against enemies from pirates to tanks and mechs, even psycho clones and armed drones. Missions vary from attack and recon to rescue and defend, across three different planets in a variety of weather and terrain. \n\nSimilarly to Wing Commander 3, the game features full-motion video sequences.",

      "description": "In the year 1998, the amount of reports of UFO sightings has been drastically increased. Stories about abductions and alien attacks became more and more widespread. Finally, after various nations of the world have failed to intercept the UFOs, their representatives met in a conference of global importance in Geneva, Switzerland. It was eventually decided to organize a secret paramilitary group, dubbed Extraterrestrial Combat Unit (X-COM). Starting with one base, two fighters, one transport, and a few soldiers, X-COM must locate the aliens, learn about their origins and technology, find out where their base is, and destroy it.\n\n<i>X-COM: UFO Defense</i> is a strategy game featuring separate but interlinked elements. On the strategic side, called GeoScape, you get a rotating view of the globe, where you see all visible UFOs (those that are within your detection range) as well as major cities and your base(s). You order movements from here, such as sending out fighters to intercept UFOs, transports with soldiers to assault/recover UFOs, and perhaps assaults on alien bases (if you find any). You also control your research, as you must invent better weapons (the Terran weapons are just no match against the alien weapons) quickly, not to mention all the other cool tech you can recover from the aliens. You also need to control your budget, as you can't afford to overextend your reach. Researchers need to be paid, engineers (who build the new toys) need to be paid, base(s) need to be be built/expanded, planes need to be bought/maintained, supplies need to be replenished, and so on.\n\nYou can earn money by selling unneeded stuff, and you receive funding from the nations of the world; however, a nation can decrease its funding if it decides you aren't operating efficiently enough within its region. It's even possible that a nation gets so fed up with you that it signs a pact with the aliens and ceases funding altogether. \n\nOnce you join a ground battle, the game switches to Battlescape, which is an isometric view of the battlefield with realistic line-of-sight calculations and turn-based combat. Your mission is usually extermination of all aliens on the battlefield, though if you can capture a few it would surely help your research efforts. If you win, you also recover any alien artifacts left on the field, which can then be researched.\n\nIn combat, each of your soldiers has a specific number of Time Units. Doing anything (moving, shooting, turning around, rearranging objects in the inventory etc.) costs a number of TUs. Once a soldier is out of TUs, he cannot act any more this turn (he gets all his TUs back on the next turn, though). \n",

There exist ships, trains, buses & trucks, helicopters and trains. The game has an isometric graphics engine and a jazz-style soundtrack.\n\nThe <i>Deluxe</i> version contains new features that were not present in the original  Transport Tycoon: the time scale of the game became larger, including futuristic vehicles such as monorails; and the editor is much more advanced, allowing you to create entire maps with terrain and cities positioned the way you like.

      "description": "The year is 2067, and the Earth's resources are nearly depleted. In search of raw materials essential for the survival of the humans, powerful corporations send explorers into a region of space known as the Frontier. However, upon arriving there, the humans find out that they are not the only ones needing resources. The alien races who had invaded Earth nearly seventy years ago have their own claims for the Frontier, and it looks like there can be no peaceful solution for the situation.\n\n<i>X-COM: Interceptor</i> has elements of strategy, but its primary gameplay style differs from most previous installments in the <i>X-COM</i> series, focusing on space combat simulation and resource managing. The player commands an elite force of starfighters sent to protect the human corporations in the Frontier. As the X-COM commander, the player must manage space stations, resources, and finances of the organization. Researching alien technology is also necessary to ensure the safety of the humans.\n\nWhen an enemy craft is spotted, the game's mode switches to space combat simulation. The player pilots starfighters, co-ordinating their wingmen, similarly to Wing Commander: Prophecy. Mission objectives usually involve destroying or capturing enemy ships, sabotaging alien trade routes, escorting friendly ships to specific locations, and raiding alien bases.",

      "description": "The 3rd part of the Command & Conquer series series is a continuation of the storyline in the first game - pitting Kane's Brotherhood of NOD and its religious fanatics against the Global Defense Initiative. In gameplay terms, the GDI is more powerful and its units have a science-fiction feel, whereas NOD is a renegade force primed for sneak attacks.\n\nThis version replaces the graphics engine with a mixture of voxel and bitmap graphics. Several new units have been added, like hover tanks, subterranean units and the Mammoth MKII Super-Unit. Unit production can be queued. Most single-player missions have time limits and specific challenges.\n\nSurprise attacks (using air transports for the GDI underground passages for the NOD) are one tactical option. Some units are only effective against certain units or buildings, emphasizing the strategic side of the game.",

To win, you must help your chosen people take over the world and wipe out the vermin who worship that other god.\n\nEach god starts out with a single human, dumped into the middle of the wilderness.  Sometimes there is inhabitable land in sight, sometimes not.  To get a chance to win, you must change the landscape, creating flat land for your followers to build on.  The more followers you have, the more powerful you will be, so take care of them. Build as fast as you can, because the other god is doing the same.\n\nWhen you have enough followers, you can make the leader of your people into a hero.  He will then go around the land you have built, literally taking strength from the people into himself, and working his way toward the enemy.  When he gets there, he will engage in holy warfare upon your enemy's people.  He will burn; he will kill.  And he won't stop until they're all dead... or he is.\n\nBut you don't have to let your people have all the fun; the gods have other tools as well.  You can drown your enemies one at a time with your land lowering powers, submerge their towns in swamps, or raise a volcano in the middle of their best farmland.  Even better, you can flood the land and drain all the people who didn't build on high ground. \n\nAnd when you win, you'll have 500 more worlds to conquer.  A god's play is just never done.",

The player give an artillery piece a shot angle and shot power, and try to hit the opponent, taking into account wind effects. The player and the opponent exchange these shots in a turn-based fashion. The game puts the player in command of a team of up to eight worms, which can move around the landscape (one at a time), using many types of weapons to try to dispatch the enemy, from bazookas to mini-guns to exploding sheep. In some situations, the worms can also jump, swing by rope, and descend with a parachute.\n\nThe game includes an expansive editor that allows players to customize nearly every aspect of the game. Custom teams can be created, and players are able to edit their special weapons, grave markers, flags, victory fanfares, and voice sets, which can be imported into the game from outer sources. A random terrain generator and a terrain-import system are provided as well. The latter makes it possible to import into the game files in image formats, which the game converts into playable terrains.\n",

      "description": "<i>Age of Wonders</i> is a turn-based strategy game set in a fantasy scenario. The campaign can be played on two sides and tells a tale how the humans come to a new land and destabilized the peace between the races, throwing the land into war. The game also features several stand-alone scenarios.\nThere is an extensive diplomatic matrix which structures the relationships between the 12 races and their respective leaders. There are global-spells which can be cast on the strategic map, outside of tactical combat. \n\nCreatures can move around without being led by a hero, so the map eventually crawls with all sorts of strange beings. Neutral forces are not always static, most of them move around and sometimes attack the 12 races. The automatic tactical-combat mode shows a somewhat detailed overview of the combat simulation: it is a worthwhile substitute for impatient gamers, especially in multiplayer encounters. \n\nAs in Heroes of Might and Magic III: The Restoration of Erathia and Master of Magic, heroes are very important. They reach new levels of skill and power with experience and can be equipped with artifacts. But they do have limitations that usually do not allow a solitary hero to overrun a city-garrison all by himself.\n\nPre-game customization allows the following choices: 5 levels of AI skill (with the 1.2 patch), 5 AI personalities (from very violent to defensive), \"classic\" turn-based moves or simultaneous turns, incarnation of the player as the main hero (if he dies, it's game over for that side), selection of the main hero's name, face, and bonus sword-and-sorcery attributes, etc. \n\nThe map editor allows the gamer to create new maps, which can have up to 3 geological levels (one or two can be placed underground, with a cramped and dark tunnel-design).",

      "description": "A real-time strategy/action game from Hothouse Creations which put you into a post-apocalyptic world plagued by a deadly virus and an even more deadly alien threat, The Brood. You will take command of an elite squad of eight bio-mechanically enhanced super agents with other more \"earthly\" comrades to battle The Brood and their followers, The Faithful, to save the world from a dreadful future...\n\nThe main goal of the game is to defend the most important areas of the world. A map gives an overview and shows every part of the world which is endangered - clicking on such a point starts the mission. This part of the game is in real-time which means you sometimes have to wait until something happens. These are randomly generated which includes the goals, e.g. killing all enemies, defusing bombs or evacuating humans. For every mission you choose four of your team members which have special abilities, e.g. healing or invisibility. You also choose weapons and other gear for every team member.\n\nThe gameplay of the missions itself is very similar to X-COM: UFO Defensive, just in real-time. You indirectly move your team over the map, give them tactical orders, e.g. to knee, to use barrage or to pursue enemies. The game can also be paused at any time to give orders. After a mission is completed you receive experience points which can be used to improve your team member's stats. All new weapons found during the mission are automatically researched by the lab.",

Gameplay also received a major overhaul; the player no longer simply has to lower and raise land to gain bigger houses which can defend themselves stronger. Now the player has to chop trees to build your huts. Depending on how many men are in the house, the faster its population and the house itself grows. It's possible to train men as fighters, priests, etc. New spells can be added to the shaman's spell inventory through the act of prayer at shrines scattered all over the world. Most spells take the form of natural disasters such as tornadoes and volcanic eruptions.\n\nEach level is represented by a tiny planet that the player can scroll around freely. Aside from the single player campaign it's also possible to challenge other players online.",

      "description": "<i>Heroes of Might and Magic</i> is a turn-based strategy game in which the player takes on the role of one of four different heroes: the warlock, sorceress, barbarian, or knight. As the hero the player must build up his or her castle by adding different buildings to earn different units to strengthen the hero's army with. Units include dragons, cyclopes, phoenixes, paladins, and many more fantasy creatures. Bulidings and units cost money and resources. Buildings can also be upgraded to unlock new unit types.\n\nAnother aspect of the game is exploring the world and discovering treasures, spells, mines to gather resources, nomad camps, magic lamps, ultimate artifacts, and more. The game uses a top down map in which the player can move his heroes a number of spaces each turn. Whenever the player encounters an enemy hero or castle a battle is shown in a close-up view.\n\nDuring battles all the player's units are shown as stacks. The player can move these stacks around on a hexagonal grid. Different units have different movement and attack capabilities requiring different strategies to use and overcome.\n\nThe goal is to defeat all opponents by conquering their castles and defeating their heroes in battle. The player must also defend his own castles from enemy attacks. The player's heroes can collect spells to use in battle and can boost the units under their command, but they otherwise don't have a presence on the battlefields. The heroes collect experience points in typical RPG manner which boosts their stats. In addition items can be collected for additional bonuses.\n\n",

      "description": "<i>Theme Hospital</i> is a level-based hospital management simulation where players have to start on an empty building, and then assemble rooms with all kinds of material, from desks and file cabinets for the general diagnosis to the expensive ultra-scanners and x-rays to diagnose such bizarre diseases such as Bloaty Head, Slack Songue or Alien DNA, and treat them with with even more bizarre machines like an Head Inflator or a DNA fixer. There several additional rooms, such as a staff room for your employees to rest, a toilet so that patients don't have to relieve themselves in the corridors, a research department to get the most advanced diagnostic and treatment technologies and a training room where consultants can teach a thing or two to rookies, making them capable doctors. The size and layout of each room can be set by the player, according to the available space. In addition to rooms, the player must provide radiators, seating for patients and drink machines.\n\nHowever, rooms don't run by themselves. Most diagnostic and clinics can work with regular doctors, but others like the operating theater and the research room require specialized staff while the ward, pharmacy and the fracture clinic require an attending nurse. At the same time, the hospital can't run without handymen cruising around the hospital to water up dry plants, clean up litter and vomit (after all, people go there because they <i>are</i> sick) and fix machines, while receptionists direct patients to the proper rooms.\n\nAs levels advance, the player faces increasingly harder situations: VIP visits, emergencies, epidemics and earthquakes, which can either take a toll on reputation or on the bank account. On the other hand, as more and more equipment is required, additional plots of land are available for purchase in later maps.",

      "description": "Dominating the exciting world of Theme Park ownership is your goal in this strategy game from Bullfrog. The first task is to set up your rides within the available land, structuring convenient paths and queues and ideally leaving some space for bigger rides once they become available, and include some lakes and trees to increase the park's allure. Rides range from Teacups and Haunted Houses to the biggest most elaborate roller-coaster you can design, and water rides that loop around other rides.\n\nShops must also be included, so that the visitors can buy food, drinks and souvenirs - the cunning player will combine salt, sugar and caffeine settings to maximize consumer interest. Staff must be hired to keep everything running smoothly, and they will only work for what they consider a fair rate of pay.\n\nYou are competing against other Theme Parks, so don't let them get an advantage over you - monitor your success in attracting customers and financial viability closely using the supplied statistics pages. More important, ensure that research is adequately funded to produce new rides.\n\nIt can be played in three modes - Sandbox level lets you concentrate on the park design elements, while Sim and Full add more strategic features.",

      "description": "<i>Deadlock: Planetary Conquest</i> is a 2D turn-based 4X strategy. Players take the roles of aliens deadlocked on a planet surface. The game has seven different races with special abilities, for example the Maugs are great scientists, ChCh-T have the highest birth rate etc. They spend turns building, expanding, and ultimately warring. The planet's surface is divided into smaller areas. Each area is home to one of the cities that need to be constructed. To colonize a new area, the player must build a colonizer. Players can expand their cities by erecting residential buildings, farms, factories, mines and research centres. Inventions made in the latter provide new units, new materials and better buildings (for example a hydroponic farm is far better than a normal farm). The residents' satisfaction is important - dissatisfied citizens (taxes are too high) protest and don't work.\n\nThe battle begins after the player places their units in a foreign land. Battles are separately animated - after being initiated players have no control over them. The game also has a spying mechanic that spies can use to steal technologies. The player wins by fulfilling one of the victory conditions, for example remaining the last living race on the planet, or reaching a set number of city centres first.",

Their mission was to stop Dr. Tolian Soran from destroying a succession of planets, so as to return him to a paradise-like dimension called the Nexus.\n\nAll of this is brought to life in this game, with a succession of 12 away missions on various planets linked by strategic space combat, and Stellar Cartography planning to track Soran's next move. Away missions are in first-person 3D and feature action and puzzle solving. Each is played out by a different member of the crew, all of whom have their voices digitised. Some sub-plot elements and related video sequences from the stars (Patrick Stewart, William Shatner and Malcolm McDowell) are not in the film and have been added to the game.",

      "description": "<i>Across the Rhine: 1944 - 1945 Armored Combat in Western Europe</i> is a mix between strategy and simulation game set during WWII. The game focuses on single tank battles during the Allied invasion of Normandy - this means the player can't influence the overall outcome of the war. The battles are mostly historically accurate but some of them use hypothetical situations.\n\nThe basic situation however is always the same: the player is in charge of tank battalions and tries to defeat his enemy. The player is presented with several windows which show different information, e.g. a tactical map, a strategical map or a battlefield from a tank's view. The size and position of these windows can be freely arranged. From these windows he also gives orders to his tanks, e.g. assigning waypoints or changing the behaviour. All this is in real-time. The player has also the opportunity to directly take control over a tank - there he has the choice between several viewpoints, including the driver's or gunner's view, and controls movement and turret. Optionally the AI can take care of the movement. This part of the game is more simulation than action game.\n\nDuring the three campaigns the player takes control over both parties. He assembles a soldier which, depending on the battle performances, gets promoted during the course of the game which results in the command over more units. There are also many options to set the realism of the game in different areas, e.g. manual fuel distribution, limited ammo, morale, air support or even invulnerability. ",

      "description": "Take control of The Fleet (humans), the Khalians, or five other races as you battle for control of the local cluster with your fleet and conquer enemy planets with your group troops. Build research centers to obtain better ships. Use your racial special unit to gain advantage on the ground or in space. Play random map or one of the built-in scenarios that can vary from one ship vs. one ship to full galactic war (variable galaxy sizes). Are you worthy of the title Star General?\r\n\r\nStar General can be best described as \"Panzer General in Space\". Turn-by-turn, the ships in Star General move exactly like the ground units move in Panzer General. \"Spatial features\" like nebula, cosmic string, and such work exactly like \"terrain\" on earth. Even the combat mechanics are nearly identical, where ships are rated in missile and beam values, like the ground units are rated in hard vs. soft assault values. It has several novel features though. Inclusion of a full AI capable of playing to death instead of relying on turn-limits is a first. Having the ground units land on planets after the space war concluded and fight a separate ground battle. Research is minimal (only 4 generic levels) and ships cannot be customized. This game is Panzer General with a space theme. ",

      "description": "The Floaters are a peaceful race of creatures who exist in their own world, drawing energy and magical power from a mysterious liquid known as the Tone. One day, an evil being called the Leviathan appeared in their world. His minions began draining the Tone pools. The Leviathan destroyed the civilization of the Floaters and split their world into several smaller ones. The surviving Floaters continued to exist, separated from each other, in these new worlds, eventually evolving into four different races. Now, the time for rebellion has come. The Floaters must join forces and destroy Leviathan and his servants.\n\n<i>The Tone Rebellion</i> is a real-time strategy game (RTS) with light RPG and puzzle-solving elements. The player must first choose the Floater tribe he/she desires to control - Tarks, Zygons, Cepheans, or Dyla. Each tribe starts on a different island, and has different affinities to the realm types encountered in the game: Physical, Supernatural, Ethereal, and Natural. The player begins with a very small unit of Floaters around a tribal center. By harvesting Tone, the player can build new structures, unique to each race, increasing the number of units. The goal is to build a bridge to another island, eventually uniting all of them in the struggle against the Leviathan.\n\nThe Leviathan at first ignores the player's attempts to strengthen the Floaters, but after a while begins building his own structures, sending stronger units to oppress the rebellion. The RPG element is present in learning and developing magic spells. Units gather experience following successful combat, reaching higher skill levels and learning new spells.\n\nEach island harbors mysterious artifacts, which must be collected and deciphered in order to understand how this particular island came into existence. These artifacts are put together much like puzzle pieces; completing a set of artifacts will enable the Floaters to successfully construct a bridge to the next island.",

A significant change is that land units can take damage in a skirmish instead of simply winning or losing (being destroyed).  There are also added rules for unit morale.  If a unit's morale gets to low, they retreat, regardless of your orders.  Other additions are allowing for reinforcements to appear on certain turns and weather factors.\r\n\r\nThe scenario editor has been enhanced so that players cannot only create their own maps and scenarios, but their own custom units, including statistics and the graphics.  So players can fight prehistoric, historical, fantasy, science fiction, or whatever battles they like.",

      "description": "<i>World Empire IV</i> is a strategy game that uses maps of real countries. Players start with either 56 or 30 armies. There are three game modes: local (includes TCP/IP  Network); Cyberwar (Internet); or War on Terror. Multiple combinations of human and computer players are possible. Network game hosting requires the World Empire game server be installed on the network.\n\nAll games (except the Real World Simulation) start with  all countries neutral or all conquered. In all modes, players can chose which countries to start in, or be randomly assigned. Each player adopts an ideology that determines if a country to be entered is friendly or unfriendly.  Individual battle and attack outcomes are computer determined, based on a combination of ideology and random factors. Conquered 'unfriendlies' require more occupation armies to prevent a revolution from taking place.\n\nWar on Terror mode is only for local play. One human player opposes Osama Smith and the Axis of Evil (Saddam Jones, Kim Doe-il, and Shah Sayed) with a variety of player combinations. Computer players are illustrated with photos.\n\nIn Cyberwar mode, a chat window allows players to communicate before and during  games. The Game host determines the number of players, country status, and whether to allow revolutions or air/sea invasions, or surrenders. Once a game has started, exiting human players can be replaced with computer players.\n\nThe object of local and Internet play to to take over all  world countries by defeating opponents country by country. The object of the War of Terror mode is to root out all terrorist cells and secure the world.",

Both sides fight on with super-advanced technology, from plasma guns to giant robots to sonar jammers. The only acceptable outcome is total victory.\n\nYou, as the Commander of either Arm or Core, must build up your base to destroy the other side, in a game developing the ideas of Command & Conquer. Unlike earlier titles in the genre, it uses a 3D world in which elevation changes have an effect.\n\nMission objectives range from taking out specific targets to rescuing hostages to capturing the enemy base and using it in the next mission. Usually you must construct a base, although in some missions you lead an attacking force.\n\nUnlike other strategy games, however, you start out with the Commander, the game's most powerful unit, and must defend him at all costs. Resource collection is very quick and easy, since a single unit can extract metal indefinitely from a mine without ever having to return to your base, while options for producing energy include solar power, wind power, hydroelectric power, geothermal power, and fusion power.",

      "description": "The setting is World War II, and England has made and trained a small group of special elite forces called 'commandos'. These commandos are specially trained to take on the most crucial and risky missions.  These men are sent in to covertly take out installations, sabotage plans, assassinate leaders, and cause as much disruption to the enemies of the free world.\n\n<i>Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines</i> is essentially a puzzle game at heart.  It is your job to lead a team of six men throughout 20 missions across the entire WWII theater.  You will deal with missions in the North African Desert, Italy, France, and even in Norway.  Strategy is a key element because you are vastly outnumbered in most missions.  Stealth is emphasized, because if the alarm is sounded, the mission gets much harder.  The amount of guards will double and sometimes they will bring in reinforcements for every enemy you kill.  Guns are rarely used, and stealth kills are preferred over noisy messes\n\nEvery mission you are given specific (and usually multiple) missions to disrupt enemy activity.  These may range from destroying trains, battleships, and structures, to rescuing captured GI's.  At your disposal are six highly trained operatives.  You have command of Tiny, the heavy-duty trained killer, Duke, the silent sniper, Inferno, the demolitions and mechanical expert, Spooky, the spy, Fins, the navy diver, and Tread, the surly driver.  Every mission you are given only the soldiers you need.  Some missions may require all six of them to be present, some missions you can pull off with only two.\n\nEach man is essential to each mission, and if one dies, the mission must be loaded to an earlier point.  Each performs a specific duty that is required to make the plan go off without a hitch.  For example, the driver is necessary in order to drive the escape truck in most missions.  The diver might be needed as a specific travel method to reach an island.  The demolitions expert might be needed to cut a hole through a fence.  Only through teamwork and careful planning can the missions be beaten.\n\nAt your disposal are also some tools that will help provide info and tips on your mission.  The eye tool will allow you to see the field of vision for the enemy you click on.  Every mission also comes with a full animated map with the positions of enemies on it.  As well, you can split the screen up to eight times, and use the camera tool to follow the path of specific soldiers in every screen.  \n\nCommandos is an open game, and there is no linear progression in the game.  There are no scripted events, and all soldiers act according to their AI.  There is no true way to beating each mission, though some paths might be more difficult than others.    Only by utilizing all of your soldier's abilities and your available resources will you be able to complete each mission and have everyone return home alive.\n\n",

      "description": "<i>Commandos: Beyond the Call of Duty</i> is a standalone mission pack for Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines. All six commandos from the original game are back, and have some new weapons and abilities at their disposal. The most prominent addition are the new non-lethal weapons (chloroform for the Spy, fists for the Green Beret, the club for the Driver etc.), which give players the ability to silently, but temporarily disable enemy guards. The Green Beret and the Spy can cuff unconscious enemies to immobilize them, and the Spy can even steal their uniforms. All commandos can control captured guards and use them as a distraction while keeping them at gunpoint, but the guards must not leave the controlling commando's field of view, else they will flee and raise the alarm.\n\nEight new and difficult missions are featured, taking place between 1940 and 1945 in various locations in Nazi-occupied Europe. The mission maps are even more detailed than in the original game, and leave little space for error. There are some mission-specific controllable characters as well (Yugoslav partisan Dragi\u0161a Skopje and Ukrainian spy Natasha). \n\n<i>Beyond the Call of Duty</i> features a separate executable that acts as a tutorial. Apart from updated and higher-quality videos focusing on gameplay basics and each commando for himself, there are two playable training missions where players can test their commandos' abilities.",

      "description": "<i>Lords of the Realm II</i> is a mixture of turn-based county and economic management and real-time combat.\n\nAs the game begins, the king has died and 5 nobles (including yourself) are vying for control of the realm, including the noble Baron, the headstrong Knight, the ice princess The Countess, and the backstabbing Bishop.  You have to hold on to your counties by building larger castles and keeping the peasantry happy and well-fed.\n\nWhen you engage your enemy in battle is when the real fun starts.  You are given a Warcraft-type view of the battlefield with the units in your army and have to either get them to retreat (a rarity) or kill every last one of the little buggers.  In a siege, you can end the battle by capturing the enemy's flag or dispatching all of your opponents soldiers to the great big Realm in the sky.\n",

Having total and complete control over land, sea and air units, you must defeat the Allied dogs as fast as you can (to get a major victory), or slower than in history (to get the minor victory).\n\nThe game's quality lies in the quantity of units. There are basically hundreds of Axis and Allied units from World War II, accompanied with \"circled\" animations and battle sounds, as well as marching or moving sounds. The Main menu is always located on the right side of the screen, with plenty of options and selections you can change to suit your preferences.\n\nA turn-based hexagon strategy game that will actually go faster if you have faster computer, but will always be playable (speed doesn't go up infinite). The first and original Panzer General, this installment would be followed by sequels and many other games in the series using the \"General\" name.",

      "description": "The land of Metavira needs your help! Contract additional mercenaries as you explore, capture, and hold new territory so the natives can harvest the valuable trees from which a revolutionary medicine can be extracted. The more trees you hold, the more money you make. The more money you have, the more you can do, such as hire native guards, hire more mercs, in order to take the offense and clear the sector of enemies. You will also need to retrieve certain objects from behind enemy lines, rescue captured personnel, capture equipment, and more. Hire a good mechanic in order to get your equipment and guns repaired, and to \"enhance\" them with various add-ons. Travel through lush jungles, treacherous rivers (with venomous snakes!), and more as you seek to free Metavira. Eventually, you'll meet up with the bad guys' leader in his compound for the final showdown...\n\n<i>Jagged Alliance</i> is a turn-based tactical combat game with a mixture of strategy, reminiscent of X-Com games. On the \"strategic view\", you get to see the various sectors of Metavira. You start with just one sector, with a few trees for your income. You need to hold more sectors in order to increase the number of trees you hold, which will increase your income. You can hire/fire mercs. \n\nEach merc can move or shoot or perform any of the other actions as long as they sitll have action points. Each of the mercenaries have personality. Some work well with others, others won't. You'll need shooters (both long and short guns), explosive experts (to set/disarm bombs/traps), mechanics/gunsmiths (fix/modify your equipment), doctors/nurses (to heal wounded mercs). Each merc has a different price, so you'll need to balance what you can afford vs. what you need. Manage the equipment as well. \n\nIf you move into an enemy-held sector, the game moves to combat mode, where you get an over-head slightly-isometric turn-based tactical combat that's based on \"action points\", which limits the amount of action each merc can perform. You can do this, or that, but not both. The action continues until the sector is no longer contested (either one side got wiped out, or retreated to another sector, or both). \n\nAfter the sector is clear, you can call in native guards to \"hold\" the sector (you need to pay for them as well) as well as hire more natives to process the \"new\" trees. You will also need to get the mercs to the homebase if any one was wounded, and let the doctor/nurse treat them. Idle mercs at the base can train to improve their ratings. Some scripted events and some random events will keep you busy such as poisoned water, a virus that attacks the trees, kidnapped daughter of chief, and others. \n\nSo to summarize, you need to manage the mercs (and their salary), their equipment (who gets what), arrange for backup (mercs at base) and medical treatment (doctor/nurse) while taking into account their personalities and strengths. You also need to manage the strategic aspects as you need to \"conquer\" each sector and then send enough guards to hold the sector after you retrieve the mercs. You manage the money as you need to balance the expenditures (mercs, equipment, guards, natives, etc.) against the income (the trees). You also get to manage the tactical aspects of the battle as you decide each move and shot. A full complement of mercenary supplies (from revolvers to M-16s, plus bombs, grenades, mines, flak jackets, helmets, and more) are available.",

The player takes on the role of mercenary commander Morgan Bernhardt, with the Skavens (humanoid, intelligent rats) as the main villains. <i>Warhammer: Shadow of the Horned Rat</i> is non-linear, the player can choose alternative missions to progress. Troops are transferred from mission to mission - as is their loss. The player commands whole groups, not single units (similar to the games in the Total War series.

      "description": "In this turn-based strategy game, based on the role-playing game Rune Quest, you take control of a clan of Orlanthi (somewhat resembling iron age Scandinavians) in the magical world of Glorantha. Yours and many other clans have recently migrated to Dragon Pass, a rich and fertile yet vastly unexplored valley. You try to survive and thrive in this environment however you can, your basic means being crops, livestock, hunting, trade, war and exploration. You can raid or fight the other Orlanthi clans, trade and ally with them and explore the wilderness around you. As resources you have the land you live on, goods your craftsmen create, rare commodities that can be found via exploration as well as horses, cattle, sheep and pigs. Your clan consists of trained warriors, artisans and farmers.\n\nThe game is split into five seasons each generally allowing the player two actions, but also restricting them: Exploration during the dark season is not advisable and your clan will usually refuse to wage war during harvest time. Additionally you will be presented with many random events which will force you to make decisions. Every decision has its consequences and even the most trivial choice will have repercussions over time. \n\nThe clan is ruled by a Council of seven that advises the player on most decisions. The council is chosen from a group of potential candidates (basically your nobility); Picking your councilmen and -women according to their abilities and the gods they worship is crucial. Just as crucial is determining who to listen to in a given situation. A great warrior may not be a good advisor on trade and diplomacy, just as a healer may not be adept at matters of war. If a council member causes too much trouble you may have to remove or even outlaw him or her. There are other reasons for reorganizing the council, the most obvious one being the death of a member.\n\nGoals of the game, other than mere survival and building a strong, rich clan, are relearning and reenacting all the myths of your gods (called performing a heroquest), forming a tribe from several clans and eventually uniting all tribes into a Kingdom under your leadership.\n\nThe game consists entirely of still images and selection screens, with a considerable amount of storytelling, requiring the player to read quite a bit. Player interaction is mostly limited to choosing by point and click.",

You must unite your people and claim the land! \n\nAt first, it may look like another Age of Empires clone with its different buildings and units, but the game plays somewhat differently. Units are not directly controllable. They have their own wills and do whatever they want to do. As sovereign, you can invest incentives (i.e. gold) to heroes which may encourage them to complete tasks you assign. You can indirectly control them by setting gathering points to various spots on the map. Units then try to reach these points and will automatically choose the right action to do at this spot once they're there, e.g. fighting monsters, harvest food or mine resources.",
