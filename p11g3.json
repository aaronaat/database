The farm, situated on an island, needs plenty of work, so you need all your skills to get things working correctly.\r\n\r\nYour many tasks range from tending to the farm animals, keeping an eye on the budget while purchasing goods (food, water, mechanical items, etc) at the local stores, and so forth. And although the main aim is to build and maintain the farm, there are plenty of opportunities to take care of yourself (go to the movies, buy pets, find a girlfriend/boyfriend).",

You can trade with many of the town's people, and fellow farmers. If you link up a friend's Game Boy, you can trade items between players as well.\n\nThe local stores supply plenty of items to help you in your quest, at a cost, of course. And if you have the time, you can go about the town in search of a little fun away from work.\n\nFrom an overhead perspective, you can explore your farming area, the local town and the Harvest Sprite tunnels, full of strange and wonderful creatures that can help or destroy your quest. There are four seasons (Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring) and each brings with it new challenges such as keeping arm animals warm during the colder seasons, and supplying water to the crops during the warmer periods.\n\nThe GBC version includes all new characters and background sprites in full color, but is also backwards compatible with the original Game Boy version.

This mode combines RPG elements such as buying items, talking to the town's folk and searching the local river for the Guardian fish. The fishing element comes into play when you bait or lure fish at the river, in hopes to find a fish.\n\nRaise mode allows you to purchase a fish tank and the extras, and raise a small fish. Much like the many Pok\u00e9mon type games, you can feed it, keep the tank clean and raise the fish.",

There are many objects on the road to watch out for, from cars to rocks to signs, if you hit one you'll go flying and loose valuable time. If you crash too often your bike can get wrecked. You can also attack other racers. The default attack is a punch, but some racers have weapons, which you can steal and use \r\nagainst them. The police patrol the various courses, so if you're not careful you can get busted. Road Rash II is not just a racing game but also a fighting game.\r\n",

For the first time on the PlayStation, it is possible to drive through the snow, and take a seat in the cockpit of a Shinkansen bullet train.\n\nThe gameplay is more arcade than simulation. The focus is on stopping at the stations at the perfect moment and position, keeping up with the schedule, obeying signals and speed limits, and ensuring the safety and comfort of the passengers. Mistakes result in points being deducted from a counter. If it reaches 0, the game is over.\n\nThe following routes are available:<ul><li>Hokuhoku Line from Naoetsu to Uragawara</li>\n<li>T\u014dhoku Shinkansen from Morioka to Shin-Hanamaki</li>\n<li>Akita Shinkansen from Akita to \u014cmagari</li>\n<li>Keihin-Tohoku Line from Shinagawa to Ueno</li>\n<li>Osaka Loop Line from Osaka to Tenn\u014dji (not in the Arcade original)</li>\n<li>Kagoshima Main Line from Hakata to Kokura (only in PlayStation and Windows versions)</li></ul>",

The Game Boy Color iteration features an official license of the 1998 season and thus all 11 authentic teams, drivers and tracks from that year. Unlike the Nintendo 64 version the game is completely in 2D and is viewed from a 3rd person perspective.\n\nThe game tries to deliver the most realistic racing experience on a handheld of its time. You can manually adjust many aspects of the car before each race, such as transmission, gear, and tyre types and the alignment of your spoilers.\n\nThe game features five playing modes (Grand Prix, Exhibition, Challenge, Time Trial and Two Player), two difficulty settings and allows for three separate save games. You can turn damage and different weather types on and off.",

      "description": "<i>F1 World Grand Prix II</i> is a formula one racing game for the Game Boy Color. Unlike the Nintendo 64 title of the same name, it features the FIA license for the '99 season with all drivers, teams and tracks that come along with said license. Unlike both the Nintendo 64 and Dreamcast version the Game Boy Color version is completely in 2D, just like its predecessor. Playing modes include: exhibition, Grand Prix, time attack, challenge and match race. The latter is a two player mode which works with a link cable. Like the Nintendo 64 version the challenge mode allows you to replay some critical events in the season. Cars can be completely adjusted (tyres, gears, wings, fuel load) and comes with variable weather conditions. You can change said settings before a race and during pit stops.",

Just like the major computer version it stresses careful planning and tactics. After a briefing that needs to be followed attentively, the player assumes the role of the commander and assembles a squad of eight operatives, each with different statistics and abilities, based on character traits such as aggression and self-control, physical elements such as stamina, and specific skills including stealth, firearms, electronics, demolitions and many other types of weapons. They can be divided into up to four independent teams. Next, the operatives are outfitted with a selection of six different rifles, six different handguns, 24 types of armor or camouflage and additional tools including heartbeat sensors and door charges. Default equipment is suggested right away, but that is not sufficient for later missions. In the planning mode, the last part of the pre-mission activities, the commander needs to set out waypoints on the map and determine the course of action.\n\nThe actual missions are shown in 2D where the different characters can sneak around, blow up doors, rescue hostages and engage the enemy, all requiring a tactical approach. The general plot points and mission objectives are true to the computer version.",

      "description": "<i>Harvest Moon 2 GBC</i> is a farming simulation game and the sequel to Harvest Moon GB. The mayor gives the player a free farm. However, the player must become a successful farmer, as the mayor will come to check on the player at the end of the year. If the farm is successful, he allows the play to keep farming a few more years. If not, he gives the player a second chance, because if they don't get their act together, he'll reclaim the land and develop it into an amusement park.\n\nThe player chooses to play as either a boy or a girl, and then chooses if they want a dog or a cat as a pet (the pet choice slightly effects gameplay). The dog keeps other dogs from invading your farm at night, and the cat will occasionally bring items to the player's house. Livestock includes cows (for milk), chickens (for eggs) and sheep (for wool). A horse may also be eventually obtained for riding and work. The player's income primarily comes from crops. They are raised from seeds and must be watered every day until the harvest. The player can then sell them. Sometimes plants will produce more than one harvest. Crops can be grown all year long, but a greenhouse must be built in order to grow flowers and herbs during all seasons. Tools can be used to help with work, and include axes, hoes, hammers, watering cans, sickles, fishing rods, pickaxes and umbrellas. Unlike the previous game, there is no dating/romance feature.",

The available racing modes are single races and a 16-race season, with progress saved to battery-backed RAM. There is also a head-to-head two-player mode via link cable. Game options include selectable difficulty, numbers of car on the track (from 10 to 20), race length (in % of a real NASCAR race, default is 3% for 11 laps), car damage (off, on, or limited) and pit mode (for short or long races).\n\nBefore a race, the selected car can be tuned from the defaults of which every driver has his own. Fuel volume, wheel lock, rear spoiler, shock absorbers, tire pressure and weight jacking are adjustable. During the race, the own car is seen from a third-person perspective, with race stats, damage and fuel indicators, speed and current gear displayed at the top and bottom. Only in the season mode there is  a choice of automatic or manual shifting.",
