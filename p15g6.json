      "description": "Starting out with just a basic Lamborghini and $6000, your aim is to rise to the top of the 4 divisions of racing through success on 60 race tracks across The United States. In each division there are 20 rival racers, up to 3 of which compete in each race at a time.\n\nThe races also feature lots of local drivers (who can take crucial positions away from you and the other championship drivers), Sunday drivers going at normal speed, and police. Before each race you will be told of the quality of the locals and the likelihood of police presence.\n\nWhen police are in the area, speeding beyond 110 km/h could see you branded as an offender, at which point the police will try to ram you off the road, Chase H.Q.-style. You can attempt to reach the end of the race despite this damage (which eventually hampers your speed) or simply pull over and accept a fine and the loss of race points. If the police subsequently stop you, the fine is heavier.\n\nEach race costs money to enter and your earnings can be boosted by betting on the results with the other championship drivers. If one of you wins, each driver gives you either the amount they bet or the amount you bet, whichever is lower. If a local wins you get your stake back.\n\nLots of power-ups can be bought along the way, including tires, radar jammers, engine improvements and nitro boosts. To move up a division you must take the Divisional Challenge, a one-off trek through a tough section within the time limit. You buy a set of 3 passes for this, each allowing one attempt.",

      "description": "If you're bored of racing Formula 1 cars, rally cars or MotoGP bikes in their natural habitats, the Micro Machines series could be for you. It involves racing miniatures representing particular vehicle types across a particular terrain found around the house. The Sports Cars race on the desktop, 4x4s in the sandpit, Formula 1 cars on a snooker table, and so on.\n\nThese levels were packed with variation. The Snooker tables has the track painted on, although this is open to deviation (as are most levels), and had you racing through the pockets and across the rim of the table. Tanks raced as well, with the chance of shooting out your opponent if they got directly in front of you. The desktop levels include binders to jump across, pencil-sharpeners to avoid, and lots of visual jokes in the open homework.\n\nViewed from overhead with small graphics, the races include up to 4 cars. In one player challenge mode you race through the 21 tracks in a set order, selecting your 3 opponents as you go along (adding a fair amount of strategy - ideally you should aim to eliminate the better CPU cars early on), eliminating one after every third race (assuming that you can finish in the top 2 of a race within your 3 lives). If you win 3 races in a row without using a continue you get a time-trial race which can earn you an extra life.\n\nThe real innovation of the game was in the multiplayer modes. You started with 4 points each, and when one car gets far enough ahead to force the other car off-screen, the slider moves in their favour. Once it reached the end (which involved beating them 4 times more than they beat you) you win the level, although if 3 laps were completed, the person leading at that point is declared the winner - with a sudden death play off if scores are level. 9 of the tracks are available in this mode, although you can also play this Head to Head system as a 1-player game across all the tracks.",

Fame, glory and bikini clad women await your victories and the taste of dirt awaits if you fail. Let a computer car beat you and you lose one of your 3 credits.\n\nSuccessful races bring more money, which can be used to soup up their machine. Boosts to top speed, grip and acceleration can be purchased, and your nitro boost must be kept topped up. If you are desperate for upgrades, you can buy into your spare credits.\n\nOnly your off-road driving abilities will be enough to pull you to first place in these races.

The player chooses one of the four available hovercars and then can race with other hovercars in one of the gameplay modes - \"Practice\" or \"Grand Prix\". \n\nIn \"Practice\" mode, the player chooses one track where he competes with one other hovercar to win the race (or there can be no rival at all, if you so wish). In \"Grand Prix\", the player must complete a series of races with several competitors. Each race consists of five laps. \n\nThe hovercar has a limited Power meter, which represents the machine's health and decreases when the hovercar collides with the track boundaries and other players. If power runs out, the hovercar explodes and the player loses the race. There are repair areas near the start line, which restore power to the player's hovercar if he drives into them. The tracks contain many more or less dangerous traps, such as icefields or landmines. \n\nCompleting a lap awards the player a \"Super Jet\" which can be activated at any time to give a short speed boost. The hovercar can keep up to three Super Jets and use them when necessary. \n\nCompleting a lap also gives points, which give the player a life when enough are accumulated. The player can lose a life in the Grand Prix mode if his hovercar explodes, if his hovercar somehow falls out of the track or if he ends up too far behind the other racers. ",

      "description": "Everybody has remembered waking up early on the weekend to watch Saturday morning cartoons. But would would happen if the cartoons were interactive? Well, you might end up with something like Death Valley Rally. The object is pretty simple: Race the Road Runner through each level as quickly as you can while collecting different colored flags, which are worth different amounts of points. When you reach the ending, if you're fast enough, you'll also get a time bonus, but if you're good enough, you'll get a flag bonus. Some of the flags are INCREDIBLY difficult to find, and the fact that you won't usually be able to find them, will challenge (or at least frustrate) most gamers. You can run, turbo run (by stocking up on bird seed), peck, and jump in this wild adventure, as you try to catch the escape the ever-witty Wile E. Coyote and his assorted ACME contraptions.",

You will earn money for each race depending on how you placed (for instance, first place nets you $7000) which you can use to purchase upgrades for your car. You need to find a good balance between the parts. To test the effectiveness of your parts you can run a test race to see how the car works before you buy. Data can be saved on the cartridge so you will not lose your parts or your race statistics. The goal is simply to complete all sixteen tracks; you will get a bonus at the end depending on how well you do so there is an incentive to play again and do better.",

One of the more successful releases of the Super Nintendo's twilight era, Uniracers mixes platform-based high-speed racing, with crazy stunts and tricks.\n\nThe basic idea in most levels of the game is simple. Get your unicycle from A to B as quickly as possible, and finish ahead of your opponent. It's like Sonic, but with none of those pesky enemies, pointless power-ups and frustrating obstructions. In fact it doesn't sound like much of a game at all...\n\nHere's the key, though. Tricks performed and landed during the race increase your speed. The better the trick, the greater your increase in speed will be.\n\nAlso, some levels are set in areas designed solely for stunts. Such levels require you to earn as many style points as possible, by doing tricks. These levels are against the clock, and a set points score, rather than an opponent.\n\nUnicycles are stupid and difficult, and yet fun, once you get the hang of them. Much the same could be said about Uniracers...",

      "description": "<i>Spectre</i> is a 3D shooter where the player drives a little red car/tank and blasts away enemies.  The gameplay is similar to Battlezone, and obviously inspired by it.\n\nThere is a selection of three tanks, each with three values (speed; armor; and firepower) balanced out to match its name: Tough Guy is heavy on armor, but slow and not very powerful; Speedy is fast, but low armor; and Balanced combines both strengths, but decreased. A fourth tank allows the player to design a custom variant.\n\nEvery level consists of a large plane filled with enemy tanks, several psychedelic walls with odd images that often flicker or warp resembling an acid trip, and tacky 3D models like windmills.  The object of each level is to either destroy all the enemy tanks in the level, or to collect all the flags. Every level has a certain theme to it, anything from plain green to a colorful blinking eye or images of sand dunes are to be found on the walls, windmills and flags throughout the level.\n\nWith every passing level, enemy tanks grow smarter and their rates of fire increases.  Also in later levels, new, smarter, more powerful enemy tanks join the skirmish. The player has a limited amount of ammo, but driving over ammo deposits replenishes a small amount of ammunition, as well as driving over shield deposits grants additional shields. The three different views (first, third, and top-down) allow the player to incorporate additional strategies into the battles.\n\nThe game boasts having supposedly an infinite amount of levels, though anything after level 80 is almost instant death.  A high score table is also included.\n\nAn additional note-worthy feature of this game is the multi-player mode. Up to eight players are supported over IPX, or NetBios (or two via modem or serial port). The network option offers three Cyberspace Scenarios: <ol><li><b>Arena</b> - free-for-all battles, get one point for each opponent destroyed.</li><li><b>Flag Rally</b> - a match point given for collecting six flags, destroy someone to get any flags being carried.</li><li><b>Base Raid</b> - Akin to \"capture the flag\".  Two teams, two bases; get match point for destroying opponent base.</li></ol>The CD-ROM manual includes a \"Cyberpunk story\", to give background information on the game which consisted of a cyberjock named Hart who lived for the battles in the Arena.",

      "description": "<i>Super Chase H.Q.</i> is an enhanced sequel to Chase H.Q. As usual, you must drive your way towards a criminal's vehicle, which is known to be involved in some crime, while avoiding passing cars to gain points. Your car also comes equipped with three turbos, which can be useful if you are way behind the vehicle.\n\nBut this time, cars aren't just the only things that you have to worry about. You will also encounter bikes that shoot or throw firebombs at you, as well as cars that go the wrong way. (If you crash into one of these, you'll be sent flying through the air.) Not to mention other obstacles such as barricades.\n\nFurthermore, as well as the criminal's damage indicator, you also have your own. When you finally catch up with each criminal,  they are likely to shoot at you if you get too close to their vehicle, but you may encounter criminals who have different ways of attacking you. The fourth criminal, for example, launches a missile at you if you are further behind him. Once you are shot at and hit, your indicator decreases for every time you are hit, but this rule does not apply when you're hit by passing cars. When your indicator is empty or when you're out of time, the game ends.\n\nWhen you complete each round, a statistics screen will appear, and you are awarded points based on the time remaining, how much damage you've done, and the number of nitros that are used. One of the options allow you to display the game's speedometer in either MPH or Km/h. The game also has a storyline, which can be viewed in between rounds.",

It is divided into a Novice-, Expert-, and Master class, with each class featuring four unique tracks.\r\nIn Stunt Trax the player has to complete courses filled with obstacles within a certain time limit while trying to collect as many stars as possible.\r\nBattle Trax is a two player mode taking place on special tracks without any CPU-controlled opponents.\r\nFinally, Test Run let's the player practice all tracks that have been unlocked.",

Five different variations of the circuit are featured, each one progressively more difficult. 250cc, 400cc and 750cc bikes are featured, each one available to be best for top speed, acceleration or handling. The bikes have two steering methods - leaning into the corner or tilting in with the bike upright -the options allow you to set which of these is controlled on the pad and which use the L and R buttons. Races can be set to last for between 15 minutes and the full 8 hours. Your ultimate aim is to win every type of race, across all bikes and circuit layouts. ",

      "description": "This third-person racing game resembles Gremlin's earlier Lotus series, in terms of its general look and feel, right down to the text font used in the game. Your task is to race through 16 countries, each of which features four races, with many real-world circuits recreated in incongruous locations (such as the Monza layout in Ayers Rock, and the old Hockenheim in Vancouver). \r\n\r\nThese four-race blocks each represent their own mini-championship, in which you race against 19 cars, needing to finish in the top 10 to continue, and with the top 6 scoring points 10-6-4-3-2-1, and the respective amount of money in thousands. This can be spent on various upgrades, ranging from engine to tires (wet and dry) and from shocks (front, side and rear) to gearboxes. The ideal approach is to buy the more expensive versions ASAP, as you get no saving when upgrading. If you win the four-race championship, you get the next password. \r\n\r\nYou get a set amount of nitro boost to use during each race, although bonus nitros, money and instant speed-up token appear on many tracks. Hazards such as puddles, barriers and ramps are also frequent.",

      "description": "There's a kind of knick-knack you may find in dusty games rooms, a maze through which you navigate a marble by subtly tilting the board, dancing with gravity and momentum, deftly rolling your sphere out of dead ends and around the obstacles posed by holes in the board. Marble Madness explores this theme in a fudged 3-D perspective, Cloud Kingdoms in a flat 2-D one -- both by directly influencing the actions of the ball.  The game takes a different approach toward a similar end; instead of moving the ball around the board, you move the board around the ball.\n\nThat's right; from the get-go, gravity pulls ever down, down, down on your ball toward the bottom of your screen regardless of board orientation; the task of the player is to rotate the board now clockwise, now counter-clockwise, to further a timely and unobstructed path beneath the ball in its progress toward each level's goal before the timer ticks down to zero.  The game might as well have been named \"inertia.\"  Many obstacles can be avoided, but some must be engaged head-on: a certain momentum, if not terminal velocity, must be achieved to break through crumbling brick barriers; other obstacles toggle on and off like traffic lights, demanding not only speed but timing.  Some influence the ball's direction, and in addition to merely delaying the ball's progress, touching some impediments incurs an additional time penalty -- conversely, some blocks bestow time bonuses, if you can afford the ever-diminishing time needed to take the scenic detour and collect them.",

Just like the previous games, <i>Top Gear 3000</i> comes with a password system that allows the player to continue a game in progress. The upgrade system of <i>Top Gear 2</i> gains new breath and now comes with newly designed parts: ranging from tires to engines up to atomic turbos. As players travel from one planet to another via spacecraft, they race on various planets in different systems, getting progressively harder. The prize money earned in each race increases as does the price of new car parts. Moreover, the game comes with a versus mode which allows up to 4 players to race simultaneously via splitscreen. ",

The game has a split-screen display for 1 or 2 players. In 1-Player mode, you'll dispute the races against the computer, that has a slightly bigger speed than yours, helping to give a lot more of competitiveness. A password system was included, being possible to stop a current game and resume it later.\n\nThrough the game, players will find several obstacles scattered by the courses, like rows of iron plates or even lots of stones. In order to qualify for the next circuit, it's required to complete it at least in the 5th position, or else the game is over.",

      "description": "Newman Haas Indy Car is, as the name shows, a racing game endorsed by the CART racing team of the same name and their top driver at the time, Englishman Nigel Mansell. \r\n\r\nThe player has the option to drive a single race (where the option to practice is hidden) or go for the crown against 12 other drivers in 15 tracks (with some variety, not only ovals) across North America, with the season opener in Queensland, Australia. It is possible play solo, with a friend in split screen or with split screen against the computer, and if music or engine sounds are played in the race.\r\nA key choice in the game is selecting between Arcade and Simulation mode - in the later, the car can take a lot less damage before giving up, fine-tuning must be done by the driver and rules are enforced, under the risk of a disqualification.\r\n\r\nGraphically, the game is less sterile than most driving games of the platform (and in 16-bit consoles, generally), thanks to the inclusion of several polygonal buildings scattered around the circuits.",

It includes 14 standard-length race tracks, plus the Suzuka 8 Hours endurance race, available in both training and Championship modes. The game is unlicensed (except by Kawasaki), so all riders and teams are fictional.\n\nThe game now has more polygonal roadside objects than <i>F1</i>, and there is still a Turbo mode, allowing for faster racing at the expense of some of the detail. You have the ability to turn on or off weather (during rainy days the graphics are darker and the bike has less traction). The number of laps on each course can be 5, 10 or 15, and there are 4 skill levels. Some changes have been made to how the vehicle handles, to emphasize the switch from cars to bikes.",

Your objective is to drive your car through the wasteland, trying to survive motorcycle gang members' attacks and to avoid running out of gas.\n\nThe gameplay is a split of two genres: racing and side-scrolling. In the racing parts you have to destroy enemies like motorcycle gang members, gyro-copter captains, red trucks, etc. Your car has a machine-gun installed in its front, and if some guy drives along side of you, a little window pops up, allowing you to shoot them with your shotgun.\n\nAlong the road there are several towns, and every time you pass through one of them, an alarm will warn you. As your gas run low, you have to stop on these towns and refuel your reserves of gas and ammo. When doing so, the game turns to a side-scrolling perspective, as you get out of your car, dealing with your enemies in hand-to-hand combats. In the cities you'll also find new equipment to your car, such as missile launchers, nitro, etc.",

      "description": "The successful movie sequel Batman Returns spawned many different game adaptations. The SNES version presents the story of Batman's encounter with the Penguin and Catwoman as a side-scrolling beat'em'up, with one Batmobile driving sequence thrown in.\n\nThere are two varieties of the beat'em'up levels. One plays like Final Fight and similar games: Batman can move in two dimensions, beating up his enemies with various punches, kicks, combos and special moves.\nSpecial gadgets to be used include the famous Batarang to take out enemies from a distance and \"Test Tubes\" filled with chemical explosives which will damage all enemies on the screen.\n\nIn the second type of side-scrolling level, Batman can only move in one dimension, left or right. The Batarang is the standard weapon here, with punches only being used when the enemy gets close. Also in these levels, Batman can use a grappling hook to cross dangerous areas unharmed.\n\nEnemies in the beat'em'up levels usually belong to the Penguin's Red Triangle Circus Gang - clowns in all varieties: thin clowns, fat clowns, clowns on bikes, clowns armed with bazookas, and more. At the end of each level there is a boss fight, including several encounters with Catwoman and the Penguin.\n\nIn the Batmobile driving level, the action is viewed from behind. Batman has to evade clowns on bikes and shoot them down when he gets the chance. At the end of the road, another boss fight awaits.\n\nDigitized images from the film illustrate the storyline.",

The game is a 3D shooter similar to Star Fox by the same development studio, but with some subtle differences. Players can morph their vehicle at any time from the standard walker to a sonic jet, a land burner and a defensive hard shell, each with their own weapons, strengths and weaknesses.\n\nThe player is cast as a soldier fighting the Aki-Do Forces, an evil empire bent on taking over the entire universe. To stop them, the player has access to an experimental mech, the Vortex, to travel the seven worlds of the Aki-Do system and destroy the bases.",

      "description": "Dirt Trax Fx is a Motocross racing game in which players can choose between 8 drivers, differing in top speed, acceleration, turning and braking, to compete on 22 different tracks. The tracks feature lots of mounds, ramps, pits and other similar obstacles. Parts of a track might also be covered in water mud or ice. To successfully navigate the motorbike through these obstacles, the shoulder buttons can be used to lean the bike, while pressing up or down changes the angle of the bike. Before the game begins, players can choose between four different bikes ranging from 50cc to 500cc (the last bike needs to be unlocked first). The choice of the bike greatly affects the game's speed as well as the overall difficulty.\n\nApart from the main race, there is also a \"Rad Tag\" mode. In this mode, a timer ticks down that can only be stopped by hitting the opponent. The driver whose timer reaches zero first loses.\n",

      "description": "RPM Racing was preceded by Rareware's R.C. Pro-Am in 1988 and Electronic Art's Racing Destruction Set in 1985, with the latter being the larger influence. It is a precursor to Rock 'n Roll Racing, which was done by the same developer.\n\nCombat, obstacles, and traction on the non-flat tracks play a significant role. There are 3 vehicle types to choose from that perform differently on pavement, dirt, ice, flat or bumpy tracks. Cars can be armed with oil, nitro, and mines. Additionally, there are 3 levels of tires, engines, shocks, and armor.\n\nThere are full race season, single race, and custom track modes. In 1 player games, the 2nd player is replaced with one of 8 AI opponents who are each associated with their own vehicle. There are 128 total tracks in this game.\n\nIn season mode, each track has an entrance fee and cash prize for placing 1st; often lesser cash prizes for lesser placements are also awarded. For an additional fee, racers can opt to move to a higher racing class (levels) where fees and prizes are bigger. Each class has its own set of tracks that the player may choose from. No track is mandatory or unavailable within a class. The player also has the option of going back to a lower class for free, which may become necessary if funds are eaten up be fees without winning prizes. However, going up always incurs a fee, even if the player has been there before.\n\nDuring custom track designing, players can set the track's laps, gravity, and starting line type. Each track section can be pavement, dirt, or ice. Track sections are laid out like puzzle pieces on a 2D non-isometric grid (Pipe-Mania style). Sections include horizontal and vertical straights, four standard 90\u00b0 turns, eight T-sections for diverging and converging multiple paths in any direction, and a criss-cross. Either a horizontal or vertical special straight section is used as the starting grid. ",

      "description": "<i>F1ROC II: Race of Champions</i> is the follow-up sequel to F1ROC: Race of Champions where the player can race to become a legend in Formula One racing, but first must have to go through three different tiers of racing in order to do so.\n\nThe player starts out in \"Group C\" in the lowest tier with less powerful cars and novice drivers.  After winning the eight races of \"Group C\", the player is then transferred to F-3000 with more advance drivers and powerful cars.  The player must win another eight tracks in this division to advance to the final division, the F-1 Grand Prix itself, with the most advanced cars and the most talented drivers and to win this series the player must compete in 16 tracks.  If the player does well enough, they can return to the Grand Prix division the following year with the ability to choose a new car and sponsor.\n\nThe main gameplay is a basic racing game, but does not involve oval tracks such as NASCAR, but twisting and turning tracks where the player must use caution when turning on winding roads.  Players can also qualify before races for a better starting spot and must make pit stops during races to replace fuel, tires and repair damage. The player can also win prize money for doing well in races to buy better parts and upgrades for their car to race better in future races.  They must be careful, however, when combining parts to try and make a perfect handling car.  If the player uses the wrong combination, they can have a car that handles well in turns, but is slow on long straightaways.  Likewise, they can also become to fast and dangerous in turns, causing disastrous accidents.\n\nIt features a battery back-up to save games and stats and also features authentic Formula One cars such as the FW14B Williams, the McLaren MP4, the Benettion B192,  the F92 Ferrari among many others and also has the entire 1992 F-1 racing season.",

Unlike its predecessor which uses an isometric top-down view of a single-screen track, this arcade racing game is made specifically for the SNES and uses its Mode 7 hardware for a 3D racing experience with a 3rd person perspective.\n\nThe game has three different tournaments, the Mexico 250, Ensenada 500 and Baja 1000. Instead of having to drive many consecutive rounds on a small circuit the circuits are big and more akin to rally racing with a finish at a different location than the start. The game is still held with many opponents as well as non participating traffic and wildlife that can hinder the player or be ruthlessly run over. Along the bumpy off-road tracks the player can collect bags of money, just like in its predecessor. Money can be spend on improvements of various of the car's parts, such as: brakes, tires, shocks, lights, engine and nitros.",

Now it's time to pay them back, with interest.\n\n<i>Gekitotsu Dangan Jid\u014dsha Kessen: Battle Mobile</i> plays similarly to Spy Hunter in both perspective and objective, but your car in <i>Battle Mobile</i> isn't quite as high tech an instrument as that other game's vehicle. You can launch unlimited missiles, but they can only hit helicopters. For ground based targets you must dash into them to ram them off the road. Your car's health is constantly dwindling, even when you're not being attacked by enemies, so picking up the occasionally appearing energy refill items is essential. Shields can be picked up and stored that will make your car invulnerable to all damage for a short while.",

The player participates in the Paris-Dakar rally with the basic goal to finish all nine stages of the race within a time limit. The driving itself is action oriented with two gears.\n\nHowever, the major difference to the computer/arcade  version is the addition of a few strategic components. Before starting the tour, the player has the choice between different sponsors. The given money is then reinvested into a navigator which tells the player the desired driving direction (sometimes jungle or darkness obfuscates the path) and spare parts. Those are important because every part of the car has only a limited durability and it may be needed to repair them during a race stage. if the parts are not available right away, the player has to take a major hit on the time limit. Repairs can also be conducted between the single race stages. Another aspect that needs to be calculated in is the weight of the spare parts: the more parts in the car, the lesser the maximum speed.",

The protagonist of the previous game has become the street racing champion of his city, but was later humiliated by the crowd because he lost an unimportant race. Offended, the hero moves to another city and decides to build up his career from scratch.\n\nLike the previous entries in the series, the game contains a story mode and a versus mode, adding to those a \"mini-story mode\", in which the player drives some of the best cars in the game in unique scenarios (one of which, for example, involves traveling to the past and racing there in a Back to the Future style). The story mode involves buying new cars, customizing them with parts, and winning races to earn money and gain access to better vehicles. Various mini-games are available by selecting locations on the city map, such as for example playing pachinko slot machines to earn money, etc.",

The player participates either in a league (three divisions with eight drivers each) or a tournament with a knock-out system (also eight participants). The races itself are always one-against-one and the winner is who has the best end time. If the player drives in the water or against another obstacle, time is lost and the car gets set back on the course - but only for a limited amount of times; after that the race is lost. The controls feature two different acceleration speeds and three different braking strengths. Up to eight players can participate in the events, but the racing itself is limited to two at the same time.",

Drifting is a preferred way to take hard corners.\n\nAs most racing games for SNES, this one heavily utilizes SNES's \"perspective polygon\" drawing mode to draw the track (which is basically a huge flat textured polygon) and overlaid sprites for objects such as cars.",

      "description": "The 16-bit console version of the movie license <i>Last Action Hero</i> combines side-scrolling beat'em up levels with driving sequences.\n\nPlayers control action hero Jack Slater through four beat'em up levels. The first two are inspired by the beginning sequence of the movie (the finale of \"Jack Slater III\"), the third by the hotel funeral inside the movie world, and the last by the premiere of \"Jack Slater IV\" in the real world. Slater must move to the level exit before the timer or his energy runs out. Various goons stand in his way and must be defeated through kicks or punches. There are four varieties of enemies in the game, wielding either knives, baseball bats, Molotov cocktails or guns. Spent life energy can be refilled by collecting movie tickets that sometimes fall from the sky. The Genesis version adds an additional twist in the first level: a crosshair will follow Slater around and randomly shoot bullets at him. All except the first stage end with a boss fight. Bosses include The Ripper, a helicopter and main villain Benedict.\n\nThe driving sequences are also seen from the side. Slater's car must avoid hitting cars and trucks parked on the road while trying to destroy enemy cars by jumping over a ramp and then landing on top of them.\n\nCutscenes tell the story of the film between levels, following the original plot only loosely.",

      "description": "Based on the 1993 Formula One Season, <i>Final Stretch</i> features a GP, 1P VS 2P, and Time Attack modes. In GP mode the player can choose either beginner or expert which have many differences.\n\nAt beginner any team can be chosen and the player will start all races without having to qualify. There's no machine setting, and one other difference is that during the actual race the vehicles do not collide with each other. In the expert one, there's the qualifying session consisting of nine laps. It is also possible to save data, among other differences.\n\nOnly a single player is allowed to compete in the GP mode, and the screen is always split. The bottom screen shows the car in the typical chase view while the top can show up to five different views.\n\nJust like Redline: F1 Racer, the game was supervised by the Japanese driver Aguri Suzuki.",

The game was exclusively released as a broadcast on the Satellaview add-on for the Super Famicom. The game was split into four episodes. Depending on which episode is being played, the roster of playable characters changes. In the first episode, Mario, Luigi, and Toad are available. In the second episode, Wario is added, and in the third, Princess Peach. In the fourth episode, Yoshi is made available, but Luigi is subtracted from the roster.\n\nLike the original Excitebike, players must safely maneuver through a dangerous course on motorbikes. Obstacles appear that can slow the player down or send them flying. In the event they do become airborne, players must adjust the angle of their bike as they fall to prevent crashing. Players can also race by themselves against computer-controlled Green and Red Koopa Troopas, or against each other in a 2-player 1-on-1 race.",
