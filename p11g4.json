      "description": "Guide a team of up to six soldiers through 72 levels of combat in this top-down action/strategy hybrid, best thought of as Lemmings crossed with Commando crossed with Dune 2. The characters are controlled indirectly using the mouse, as you activate each soldier or group of them by highlighting them, click the left button to move them to a particular spot, and the right button for them to fire guns at an enemy. You can also pick up grenades or rockets, which can be used to destroy groups of enemies, buildings or some vehicles (by pressing both buttons at once). \n\nEach mission has a specific objective, and some feature vehicles such as tanks that used make things easier. Your troops can cross water but can't shoot within it, so finding and controlling bridges is often crucial. You can use the arrangement of trees to find hiding places to shoot from, and should watch out for CPU soldiers also doing so.",

      "description": "A sequel to Worms 2, <i>Worms Armageddon</i> expands upon its predecessor by enhancing a few facets of gameplay and including play over the Internet through Team 17's WormNet. \n\nLike the previous <i>Worms</i> installments, the game is an artillery variant. The player give an artillery piece a shot angle and shot power, and try to hit the opponent, taking into account wind effects. The player and the opponent exchange these shots in a turn-based fashion. The game puts the player in command of a team of up to eight worms, which can move around the landscape (one at a time), using many types of weapons to try to dispatch the enemy, from bazookas to mini-guns to exploding sheep. In some situations, the worms can also jump, swing by rope, and descend with a parachute.\n\nThe game includes an expansive editor that allows players to customize nearly every aspect of the game. Custom teams can be created, and players are able to edit their special weapons, grave markers, flags, victory fanfares, and voice sets, which can be imported into the game from outer sources. A random terrain generator and a terrain-import system are provided as well. The latter makes it possible to import into the game files in image formats, which the game converts into playable terrains.\n",

Dark Duel Stories</i>, the player's goal is to defeat various characters from the <i>Yu-Gi-Oh!</i> manga, anime, and card game, eventually making it to the four Rulers of Ancient Egypt, who have the precious Millennium pieces. Each character must be defeated at least five times in order to get to the next stage. Typically, the goal of a card duel is to reduce the opponent's 8000 life points to zero; however, sometimes a duel can be won by forcing the opponent to run out of cards in their deck, or by having all five pieces of Exodia in one hand.\n\nAs usually in <i>Yu-Gi-Oh!</i> games, cards represent monsters: as a general rule, a monster with a higher attack and defense rating emerges victorious. However, in this game elemental affinities play a role as well. For example, a monster of the Aqua element will be beaten by a monster of the Thunder element even if his attack and defense ratings are somewhat higher. \n\nThe player can also create his/her own cards by combining card halves that can be obtained after winning a duel. A trade mode and a real-life battle mode (using the link cable) is also available.",

Players can control either side, each of them offers 30 missions. \r\n\r\nWarlocked brings real-time strategy gaming to the Boy Color set in a fantasy warfare scenario. The key to victory is a balanced mix of resource gathering, building, exploration and combat. Adding a magical twist to the straightforward action is the presence of wizards, each of whom has one powerful spell. While some wizards can convert enemy troops to your side, others can change them into chickens or skeletons. More than 20 kinds of wizards are hidden throughout the game.\r\n\r\nUsing a Game Link Cable, you can test your war skills against another player. Two-player battle maps are earned by progressing through the single-player game. Warlocked also enables you to build your own personal armies with resources that you have saved in your campaigns in single player mode, and then trade them with a friend using the infrared ports on the console.

      "description": "The first handheld <i>Sakura Taisen</i> game, released between the second and the third main ones, takes place in the original setting: the imperial capital in Japan of 1920s. It is the Taishou era, time of rapid technological development and acquaintance with Western lifestyle in Japan. Disguised as a group of actresses in the imperial theater, the Hanagumi Brigade consists of lovely ladies who are at the same time skilled fighters, able to pilot mechs, and to confront the forces of evil that threaten Japan. A new commander of Hanagumi arrives at the theater to work under the guidance of Ichiro Ogami, the main hero of the series. He leads the beautiful girls Sakura, Sumire, Honglan, and others into battle against demons.\n\nAs in most other games in the series, <i>Sakura Taisen GB</i> is a mixture of Japanese-style adventure with dating mechanics and tactical turn-based battles. The light RPG angle is also present, as the girls fight differently depending on how the protagonist treats them. Unlike other Sakura Taisen games, the battles here are entirely menu-driven. Also, the main plot is non-linear, and it is possible to reach fourteen different endings, which also include bad ones. The hero may even get thrown out of the theater for indecent behavior.",

      "description": "<i>Hexcite: The Shapes of Victory</i> is a puzzle game played on a honeycomb-like playing field. In the center is a hexagon; six more hexagons make up the entire playing field. Because of the turn-based gameplay, two people can play using only one system. Two-player link mode is also supported.\n\nPlayers begin by placing a geometric shape (triangle, hexagon, parallelogram, etc.) in the center hexagon.  The CPU or human opponent then places another shape adjacent (and touching completely on one side) to a previously played piece.  Players score bonus points for completing any full hexagon. Much of the strategy in this game is in tricking your opponent into letting you take a bonus. Bonuses are also scored for placing a piece so that two sides will contribute a score. The game is over when all pieces have been played, or if the remaining pieces cannot be played.  In that case points are subtracted for any remaining pieces, based on the complexity of the shape (twice as many points are subtracted for a hexagon compared to a triangle).\n\nIn Japan, this game has seen several Windows versions, and even has been released as a board game.",

      "description": "Monkey Puncher is a game where the goal is to train a monkey to fight in boxing matches in order to save your kidnapped sibling. You can choose to play as either a boy or a girl character; the one you do not pick is your sibling. \n\nShortly after starting the game you are given your first monkey, Freddy. You can train him in skipping, using a punchbag, doing sit-ups, running and even going shopping. There is also a sixth activity, called sparring. These activities work to improve his speed, power, strength, stamina, knowledge and (for the latter activity) all of these, although only by a small amount.\n\nIn all of the aforementioned apart from shopping, you train your monkey by getting him to copy your actions; your actions are controlled by the rhythmic pressing of the A button. After a while, your monkey should be able to imitate your actions with ease, eventually being able to start the activity without prompting. In regards to shopping, you can send him out to buy what you want from a selection of items, or just let him go out and buy what he likes. This is a good way of obtaining certain items that are otherwise unobtainable. The rarity of items and the accuracy of which items it brings home from your shopping list increases as its knowledge does. Sparring involves pitting your own monkey against a computer controlled one in order to raise every stat by a small amount. Finally, you can 'date' your monkeys, either with each other, with a friend's monkey or in the dating shop available within the game. This is a good way of obtaining monkeys with higher stats, depending on which monkeys you breed and with whom. \n\nDuring boxing matches, you do not have direct control over your monkey, but in between bouts you can do things such as refill its health, stamina, or both. You can also advise it on what strategy to use against its opponent. These matches are won by either a count or by KO'ing the opponent, however if time runs out before there is a clear winner, the winner is the monkey who is left with the most health at the end of the match.

Each round one player guesses a grid of the opponent's board and is told if it was a hit. The winning condition is to sink all enemy ships first. The speciality of this variant are a few extra weapons with a limited usage which can bomb multiple fields at once. There is also a radar which reveals four fields of the enemy board.",

Any number of positions can be taken over by computer opponents. The game comes with eight different opponents, which are selected from a portrait gallery (8- and 16-bit versions feature different names and portraits).\n\nIt is possible to set up a time limit for a game, and also to customize the game. Amount of starting money, owned properties, houses and hotels can be set for any player before starting. The game also comes with a number of preset scenarios with varied starting parameters. The 8-bit versions have eight scenarios, the 16-bit versions add another four. The Game Boy versions also feature the scenarios, but don't have the customization option.\n\nDuring gameplay, the board is seen from the top. Moving tokens are displayed in a special animation in the center of the board, as is a hand throwing the dice. Auctions and trades take place on special screens, with the 16-bit versions being more elaborately animated and illustrated.",

In concept, rules and gameplay it is based closely on the original PC game, but has controls and graphics adapted to the handheld and comes with its own set of scenarios.\n\nAs in the original game, players control one of four warlords and must defeat the other three to win a scenario. Heroes are the central units of the game and are used to explore the top-down map, gather treasure and resources, claim mines, find artifacts and fight battles against roaming creatures or enemy heroes. The player's castles are used to recruit new heroes and to produce units to both defend the castles and make up the heroes' armies. Castles can be upgraded by adding new buildings, allowing for different and more powerful units to be built. Battles take place on special tactical screens and allow attacker and defender to give movement and attacking orders to each group of units. Heroes can employ magic spells during battles, but otherwise don't take part in the fights directly. By gaining experience, heroes level up RPG-style, increasing the power of their armies in the process.\n\nThe game does not include a campaign like the PC version, but instead comes with a selection of 31 freely selectable scenarios designed especially for the handheld. These are rated according to difficulty (6 easy, 17 medium, 8 hard) and map size. The opponent's intelligence and the amount of initial resources are customizable. Games can be saved to battery-backed RAM, for which three save slots are available.",

      "description": "<i>Othello Millennium</i> is a adaptation of Othello/Reversi for Game Boy Color. The main draw is the Story Mode, where players select between a boy or girl as their character and play through a total of five levels of increasing difficulty against animated CPU opponents represented by animals. Before each match, players are asked a series of trivia questions pertaining to Othello, and some strategy questions where they are asked to choose the best move for a given board state; getting these questions right is not necessary to advance the game. They can also skip this mode entirely and just play a single game, selecting between 4 CPU opponents or choosing to play against Guest, which lets them play a two-player game (by handing off the game to a second player between moves).",
