      "description": "In <i>Grand Theft Auto</i>, the player takes the role of a small-time criminal trying to make it big with the mob. Stealing cars, doing jobs for the gangsters and behaving generally anti-social are the way to success.\n\nThe action moves through six levels spread over three different cities, each based on a real US city: Liberty City (based on New York City), San Andreas (based on San Francisco) and Vice City (based on Miami). To finish a level, a certain score must be reached. Stealing cars and crashing into traffic, driving over pedestrians and killing cops all raise the score, but the \nbig points are made through jobs. Answering phones or entering special cars brings mission assignments, from simple \"ditch-a-hot-car\" jobs to supporting bank robberies or carrying out assassinations. Completing a mission will raise the score substantially and also increase the score multiplier, so that completing the next felony will gain even more points.\n\nCriminal behavior comes with a price of course: if policemen witness a crime, the player's wanted level rises. At the lowest level, a single police car might give chase, whereas at the highest level whole car squads hunt the player, the police set up roadblocks and shoot to kill. The only way to evade the cops is to find a respray shop and get a new paint job with new license plates. This costs money which is deducted from the score, however. But even dying or being arrested are not the end. The player has several lives, and ending up in jail simply results in being stripped of all weapons and armor and the score multiplier being lowered.\n\nThe entire action is viewed from a top-down perspective, which zooms out while driving a car, for a better overview at high speeds. The cities are many screens large and can be freely explored. Crates are scattered over the cities, which might include weapons (from pistols to rocket launchers), armor or other bonus items: extra lives, police bribes (used to reduce the wanted level to zero) and get-out-of-jail-free cards (used to retain score multiplier and weapons when busted). Dozens of different vehicles are available for the taking, each with unique characteristics: a bus will handle very differently than a sports car.",

      "description": "Lie, cheat, and steal your way through three districts of a huge city in the follow-up to Grand Theft Auto. Earn the respect of 7 different gangs as you demolish the town in your attempt to make lots of cash.\n\nThe game takes place at an undisclosed time in the near future. Unlike the first game which featured three different cities, <i>Grand Theft Auto 2</i> only features a single town, but it's divided in three districts which are unlocked one at a time: downtown, residential and industrial. Like in the original the player goes around answering phones to initiate various missions. The game uses an overhead camera in a 3D landscape and allows the player to freely explore the city and steal any vehicle the player sets his or her eyes on. To unlock new districts the player must reach a certain score which is done by committing crimes and finishing missions.\n\nBecause the game now features multiple criminal gangs, the player must choose allegiances. Performing missions for one gang, will decrease the player's reputation for another. When the player commits crimes he also becomes wanted by the local police, but as more crimes are committed without shaking the police, they will give way for first SWAT Teams, then Special Agents and finally the army.\n\nNew features include the ability to save at the church, when donating enough money, and various side missions, such as becoming a taxi driver to ear money. There are also many new cars with weapons attached such as a firetruck with a flamethrower and a car with machine guns.\n\nOn the PC version the player can change the time of day from noon to dusk to allow for more moody lighting. On the PlayStation the game can only be played at noon, and on the Dreamcast only at dusk.",

You can also attack other racers. The default attack is a punch, but some racers have weapons, which you can steal and use \r\nagainst them. The police patrol the various courses, so if you're not careful you can get busted. Road Rash II is not just a racing game but also a fighting game.\r\n",

You start the game with a Lotus Elise, but as you gain more money you'll be able to buy other cars like Mustangs and Jaguars. \n\nThe game offers three modes. The first one, <i>Single Race</i>, involves beating the clock and other computer opponents on any of the tracks using any of the cars. In the tournament mode, you can earn extra money to buy new and better cars, or to upgrade your current car. You can also unlock additional tracks. In the <i>Cop Chase</i> mode, you take control of a police car and have to pursue the computer controlled racers. The game also has a two player mode allowing you to compete using the Link Cable.",

      "description": "Everyone in Mickey's home town was getting prepared for a big carnival!  Professor Ludwig Von Drake had just finished all the carnival floats and was showing them to Mickey, Minnie, and all their friends.  However, spying from his creepy mansion on the outskirts of town was Big Bad Pete, furious at the group enjoying themselves.  Soon, he'd gathered his cronies and raced into town, swiping all the floats and decorations.  All that was left was a letter challenging them to a race to get their things back.\n\n<i>Mickey's Racing Adventure</i> centers around isometric racing challenges in various worlds.  It's possible to play as Mickey and his friends, as they explore various parts of Mickey's town, earning money for car upgrades and finding train tokens to travel to different worlds and challenge Pete and his henchmen to various races.  For a fee, Magica de Spell will also conjure up spells for you to use in races and get an edge on your opponents.\n\nThe first time you travel to a new world via the train, Casey Jr., you must play a special train mini-game.  Pete has muddled the tracks leading to the worlds, and you must guide Casey Jr. by shifting the track tiles around so that he doesn't hit any dead-ends.  There are also TNT detonators that you must set off by running into them before you can guide Casey Jr. to the exit.\n\nThe game also allows you to play as Pluto - while he can't race himself, he can sniff around town and dig for secrets.  He'll also find hidden tunnels which let you play a Digger-like mini-game where you must either collect all the bones underground, or defeat the other dogs in the area by dropping rocks on them.  After completing the objective, Pluto must then head to the exit.\n\nMickey's Racing Adventure also supports the Game Boy Color's Infra-Red feature by allowing you to send e-mail to your friends via the Infrared Communications port.  Once you unlock the Print Shop, you can also use the Game Boy Printer to print out assorted Disney stickers.",

      "description": "The Weasels have kidnapped Mickey Mouse's dog!  All that was left was a ransom note with a picture of Pluto being hauled away in a van, and some scrawled writing taunting Mickey to try and catch them.  Not knowing what else to do, Mickey called up his friends, who all volunteered to help - even Big Bad Pete plans to race!  You'll have to speed across the country to catch up with the weasels and rescue Pluto!\n\nMickey's Speedway USA is an isometric racing game that uses the same engine as Mickey's Racing Adventure.  Players can choose from Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Daisy, Goofy or Pete (and some secret characters too) as they race around various famous cities and landmarks from the United States, including Los Angeles, the Grand Canyon, San Francisco, Montana, and Yellowstone, just to name a few.\n\nThe Adventure Mode of the game plays out Grand Prix style.  You must complete four races in each world, and at the end of each race, you're given points based on your placing.  The player with the most points at the end of the four races wins the trophy for that circuit.  There are assorted power-ups that help you as you race, including the Baseball Chucker (a projectile), the Magno Flyer (a homing missile), the Carbo Spritzer (a turbo), and the Paint Splotcher (an oil slick).\n\nThere is also a Time Trial mode which lets you race any track that you've previously unlocked - while you can use it to practice tracks, the goal is to race fast enough to beat the track's lap time and earn a gold star in every race.  Another mode is Professor Von Drake's 'Driving School'.  In this mode, you must complete specific tasks given to you, such as parking, reverse parking and slalom driving.  The faster you perform these tasks, the better ranking you will receive (again, with a gold star as your ultimate goal).  However, you will receive a time penalty if you hit a cone or wall, or miss your parking spot, so accuracy counts as well.\n\nMickey's Speedway USA supports many of the Game Boy Color's functions - you can play a two-player link cable race, transfer data from Mickey's Racing Adventure via the IR Link to unlock a secret, and connect to the Nintendo 64 version of Mickey's Speedway USA using the Transfer Pak.  As you progress through the game, you'll unlock many postcards and pictures for your album, which can be printed out via the Game Boy Printer.",

The Game Boy Color iteration features an official license of the 1998 season and thus all 11 authentic teams, drivers and tracks from that year. Unlike the Nintendo 64 version the game is completely in 2D and is viewed from a 3rd person perspective.\n\nThe game tries to deliver the most realistic racing experience on a handheld of its time. You can manually adjust many aspects of the car before each race, such as transmission, gear, and tyre types and the alignment of your spoilers.\n\nThe game features five playing modes (Grand Prix, Exhibition, Challenge, Time Trial and Two Player), two difficulty settings and allows for three separate save games. You can turn damage and different weather types on and off.",

They all have their own special weapon to give them an edge in the races. The races are organised by a mad doctor who hopes to find the ultimate soldier among these micro maniacs.\n\nThe Game Boy Color version is completely in 2D. In good Micro Machines tradition, the races are all held in and around the house, including the garage, living room, bathroom, study and deck.",

Unlike both the Nintendo 64 and Dreamcast version the Game Boy Color version is completely in 2D, just like its predecessor. Playing modes include: exhibition, Grand Prix, time attack, challenge and match race. The latter is a two player mode which works with a link cable. Like the Nintendo 64 version the challenge mode allows you to replay some critical events in the season. Cars can be completely adjusted (tyres, gears, wings, fuel load) and comes with variable weather conditions. You can change said settings before a race and during pit stops.",

Some of the most famous Nickelodeon characters are competing on the race track and the player can choose to play as any of them. \n\nTwo game modes exist: quick race and championship. In the quick race mode players can choose to play any track of the four available program environments. In the championship the player has to complete each track in a specific order. \n\nThe game allows the player to race as the following seven Nickelodeon characters:\n<ul>\n<li>Tommy</li>\n<li>Eliza</li>\n<li>CatDog</li>\n<li>Arnold</li>\n<li>SpongeBob SquarePants</li>\n<li>Dagget</li>\n<li>Norbert</li>\n</ul>\nTracks are divided into four different program environments: Angry Beavers, The Wild Thornberrys, SpongeBob SquarePants and Rugrats. There's numerous power ups that the player can pick up. For example: Checkered Flag will increase the car's top speed, wrapped package gives the player a free lap, stop sign will stop the opponents for a short time and the milk bottle causes the opponents to lose traction.

The goal is to win all 9 gold medals by obtaining more points than the competition. Arcade mode is the same, except all championships and stages, as well as Jeremy McGrath, are unlocked from the start.\nThe difference between championships is the engine size - with larger (thus faster) bikes, the player has less time to react, and going head to head into the edge of the track can be a matter of a simple bump in 80cc to a spectacular flip into the stands in 250cc, also because it becomes a lot harder to do sharp turns in a limited space.\n\nWhile it can be played as a straightforward racing game, by performing tricks the player can obtain some powerups - a bomb will knock down the next opponent, the arrow temporarily boosts bike stats and the shield allows the player to barge into one opponent, knocking him off his bike. There is one big catch - the skull and bones knock the player out of his bike, which can prove to be decisive in a close race.",

      "description": "The game based on the pod racing scenes from <i>Star Wars: Episode I</i> received a unique adaptation on the Game Boy Color.\n\nThe game features 5 different planets with 4 tracks each for a total of 20 tracks. Only the first track from each planet is available from the start and the only available pod racer available to select is Anakin Skywalker's. Winning races unlocks further tracks on each planet and allows the player to choose the racers of the beaten opponents. When all four courses from a planet are won, a duel against Sebulba opens up. Winning it unlocks Sebulba's racer, but losing another race takes it away again. All racers differ in top speed, acceleration, turning rate and body strength (i.e. amount of damage the racer can take).\n\nRaces are seen from a top-down view and are always one-on-one. Unlike in the film or the console game, there are no laps and the first racer to cross the finish line wins. When normal top speed is reached, a flashing light indicates that a turbo boost is available that allows the racer to reach its real top speed. The turbo shouldn't be used for more than a few seconds, though, because overusing it damages the racer. Crashing into the opponent or track obstacles also causes damage. Too much damage causes the racer to blow up, but the only real effect is some time loss, since it is put back on the track after a few seconds. It is possible to repair damage mid-race at the cost of speed and acceleration.\n\nThe game offers a two-player mode via link cable and the cartridge has a rumble feature.",

The selection of game modes is based on that from the main game as well: there are single races, tournaments and the cop chase mode. Tournament mode consists of seven different cups, which have to be won in order. The easier cups begin with only two laps, increasing to eight laps in the later ones. Winning cups unlocks tracks for the single race mode. Winning races earns money and upgrade points. Money is used to buy new cars and the upgrade points can be spent on better acceleration, traction or top speed as well as to buy power bursts, which give short speed boosts in a race. Progress is saved via battery.\n\nThe cop chase mode offers four special police variations of the regular cars and is played on tracks unlocked in the tournaments. The goal is to hand out tickets to other cars on the track within a time limit of one minute by ramming into them with the siren activated. Each ticket gains $500 that add to the winnings from the tournaments.",

Further cars and tracks are available as hidden bonuses. Races are seen from a top-down perspective.\n\nThe modes are similar to those in the developer's earlier Test Drive 6. The main gameplay mode is Tournament Mode. Seven different cups are available that have to be taken on in order, unlocking tracks in the process. Winnings from races can be spent to purchase new cars. After every race, power up points are awarded that can be used to improve the car in acceleration, top speed, traction and gearing. It is also possible to equip the car with a GPS, which provides a map of the track during a race, and with further enhancements, the locations of all drivers. Also available are power bursts and power winches. Bursts give a short speed burst, while winches can be used to quickly reset the car to a checkpoint if it becomes stuck at an obstacle like mud or water.\n\nSingle Race mode allow players to race on unlocked tracks with their purchased cars. In Patrol Chase mode, players can select from special cop variants of three different cars, with the goal being chasing down the other cars on the track and giving them tickets by ramming into them.\n\nThe game cartridge (US version only) has a rumble feature that lets players experience all the bumps and rough terrain first-hand.",

Unlike the version for console and PC, the handheld presents the races in a top-down view with less features and options.\n\nThe game consists of several divisions of 2 tracks each. Only the first division is available from the start, others are unlocked by placing first in all races of earlier ones. At the beginning, only the taxi (as driven by Bruce Willis' character in the film) can be used. Further cars must be purchased with money won in the races (by placing first, second or third). Eight different cars are available to buy, differing in ratings for power, traction and shield strength. The more powerful cars can only be bought upon reaching higher divisions. Progress through the game is stored via passwords.\n\nRaces are against three opponents, take place on circular courses and consist of four laps. The futuristic hovercars have the ability to change altitude, either driving on the ground or high in the air. Flying high is necessary for maximum speed, but there are obstacles on the track that can only be passed by driving under them. There are also power-ups that can only be picked up when on the ground. These include missiles, shields, speed boosts, slowdown bubbles and short-time invulnerability. An arrow is always in view and points out corners and, when in high altitude, obstacles.",

      "description": "<i>Toy Story Racer</i> is a kart racing game based on the Toy Story films. Completely different from the PlayStation game of the same name, the GBC version features circuit racing on ten tracks and employs 3D graphics through use of pre-rendered full motion video.\n\nThe game includes two modes: a tournament and a quick race. Only three tracks are available from the start in quick race mode, the others have to be unlocked in the tournament. Players can select from four Toy Story characters: Buzz Lightyear, Woody, Bo Peep and Mr. Potato Head. The tracks are located in Andy's house, the Pizza Planet and the streets around the neighborhood.\n\nRaces are against three competitors and are seen from a third-person view behind the player's kart. The tracks have been pre-rendered in (simple) 3D; hitting the gas begins playing the track video to give the illusion of the kart moving forward on the track. Turns are thus automatic, but steering is still necessary to not crash into the sides of the track and slow down. Various items can be found on the road, some with positive, some with negative effects. Positive ones include a horseshoe for invincibility and a tire for perfect grip. Negative ones are an anchor for a full stop, a snail for reduced speed and a steering wheel that switches left and right on the controls. There are also golden coins to pick up. These become necessary if a character is removed from the game by finishing in fourth place or not completing a lap within the time limit. With enough coins, removed characters can be bought back. If all four are removed, it's game over.\n\nProgress through the tournament is stored via passwords. The game has a high score table (deleted upon turning off), selectable difficulty and the choice of races consisting of 3 or 5 laps.",

So Chip and Dale decide to enlist their friends to help collect the pieces of the machine before nightfall hits. They decide that racing would be the quickest way to get the pieces, and since time is of the essence the pieces should go to the quickest of the friends. Of course, everyone wants to be the hero, so the races won't exactly be that friendly.\n\n<i>Walt Disney World Quest: Magical Racing Tour</i> is side-scrolling kart racer. The selectable racers include Chip, Dale,Amanda Sparkle, Tiara Damage, Bruno Biggs, Moe Whiplash, Otto Plugnut Oliver Chickley III, Polly Roger, Baron Karlott, as well as Jiminy Cricket and two other characters who are unlockable after certain conditions are met.\n\nThe regular race tracks include racing at Big Thunder Mountain, Blizzard Beach, Dinosaur (Disney's Animal Kingdom), Rock 'N' Roller Coaster, Haunted Mansion, Jungle Cruise, Tomorrowland Speedway, Space Mountain, Pirates of the Caribbean, and Splash Mountain The races consist of going around the track in three laps against three other opponents. On the track itself are coins that when collected increase the players speed and arrows on the ground called zippers which give the player a temporary burst of speed. There are also Mickey balloons that when ran over are popped and give the player an item which can either help the player or hinder their opponent. Items include acorns, guided bottle rockets, teacup mines, frog spell, turbo, and invincibility, There are also eight fairies on each race course to collect that involves the games unlockable content. Coming in first place earns the player a piece of the fireworks machine. \n\nThese race courses can be raced three times each, Once for the machine piece, once for a 1st Place Pennant, and once again for a Trophy Challenge. While the first two are done as races with competitors, the Trophy Challenge just has the player by themselves trying to collect trophies in a limited amount of time.\n\nThere are also three Disney Challenge courses where the player has to collect 30 coins before the time expires in order to earn a piece of the fireworks machine. The courses are Test Track (Epcot Center), Typhoon Lagoon, and Disney Studios.\n\nBesides the Adventure mode storyline there is also a Time Trial mode.",

Besides employing 2D graphics appropriate to the platform, it features different tracks and a limited selection of modes and cars.\n\nThe game includes five different cars (all of which handle differently) and nine tracks. Only the first track can be chosen from the start. Subsequent tracks are unlocked by placing third place or higher in a circuit race on the previous track. Once a track is unlocked, it can also be used for a time trial race.\n\nThe races are shown in a pseudo-3D bird's eye view, with tunnels and signs sometimes obscuring the racers. A major gameplay element is picking up power-up icons: the turbo icon delivers a short speed burst, necessary for beating the competition. There is also a grip icon that temporarily improves handling. Oil slicks on the tracks should be avoided.",

It reuses several of the original's modes and gameplay mechanics and adds one original mode, but has a smaller selection of cars, and a graphics engine adapted to the handheld platform.\n\nThe game includes 12 cars (down from 22 in the console version) and 12 tracks. Only five cars are available from the start, the rest are unlocked by accumulating mileage. The tracks follow the same themes as those in the console version: from exotic locales (Korea, Ireland, Tibet) and cities (Hong Kong, Las Vegas) to far-out fantasy worlds (Atlantis, a prehistoric jungle, Mars). They have however been redesigned to fit the 2D engine, which uses an OutRun-style perspective view of the track, so there are none of the extravagant jumps and drops of the original. The engine offers three different viewing heights to choose from.\n\nThe three game modes are Exotica, Freestyle and Circuit. Exotica is the main game mode, consisting of consecutive races on all of the game's tracks. Winning a race is necessary to advance to the next track. In Freestyle mode, all tracks can be accessed for a trial run from the start. Circuit mode is exclusive to the GBC version: it moves through various multi-track rounds, in which final placements determine a point score. Reaching a certain score threshold is necessary to advance to the next round.\n\nThe game uses the same trick system as the console version: double-tapping the gas launches the car into a wheelie for a short speed burst. When hitting another car, moves like flips, spins and rolls can be launched through button combos, accelerating the car further.",

Released in conjunction with versions on consoles, the Game Boy Color version has its own modes and tracks and platform-appropriate graphics.\n\nThe game includes eight different characters and their vehicles as seen in the TV series, all with different top speed, handling and acceleration. Only half of the characters are selectable from the start, the rest have to be unlocked by completing several of the game's modes. The races take place over nine tracks located all over the United States, from Alaska to Hawaii and from New York to Oregon.\n\nFour different game modes are available: Arcade mode consists of three different cups of three tracks each. Finishing among the top three is necessary to advance from one track to the next. Endurance mode takes place on shorter variations of the regular tracks. In this mode, the racer in last position gets eliminated after every checkpoint until only the winner remains. Winning a track is necessary to advance to the next. Championship mode goes trough all tracks in order, with points awarded depending on finishing position. Time Trial mode allows the practicing of every track and competing for the best times.\n\nThe races are seen from a view behind the racer, with an OutRun-style perspective view of the track. Power-ups lie on the track and can be picked up to unleash a variety of effects. These include self-guided missiles (explosive and freezing) as well as temporary speed-ups and invincibility. The AI opponents use different power-ups that they drop into the player's way, including bombs, mines and oil slicks.",

While it features the same storyline and environments, the handheld version has platform-appropriate 2D graphics, different track design, and less gameplay options.\n\nAs in the PC game, the goal in the game's main championship mode is to defeat Mr. X, the top racer of Stunt Island. To be able to compete against Mr. X, four other racers must be defeated first. The championship moves through four environments with five tracks each: city, desert, jungle and ice, followed by the final challenge against Mr. X. Races must be won in order to continue. The quick race mode sets up a race on a random track, while the single race mode can be used to play races on tracks unlocked in the championship.\n\nAt the start of the game, four different cars are available, which more available for unlocking by winning races in championship mode. Unlike in the PC game, the cars cannot be customized for different track conditions with wheels or, for visual splendor only, with colors.\n\nRaces are seen from a top-down view. Cars corner automatically, with the player only controlling acceleration and lane changes, with the gist of the game thus being slowing down enough before corners so the car isn't thrown off-track while still being fast enough to win. Sometimes, one of the two lanes is blocked, making switching necessary. While there are ramps and jumps in the game, the more extravagant elements of the PC version like jumping through smoke pillars or driving through loops are not present. Power-up pick-ups have also been reduced: the remaining ones are oil slicks, temporary speed-ups, invincibility and perfect grip.\n\nLike the PC version, the handheld version also features a track editor, with more than a dozen constructed tracks being able to be stored via battery backup. Playing through the championship mode unlocks new pieces to be used during construction.",

      "description": "<i>Woody Woodpecker Racing</i> is a kart racing game featuring characters from the popular series of cartoons starring Woody Woodpecker.  Unlike the associated game for 3D Platforms, the racing is depicted in a top-down 2D view.  Gameplay remains heavily modeled on <i>Mario Kart</i>, as the the player races around a track with the usual array of speed boosts, jump ramps, water hazards, and cliffs.  Riding over star blocks rewards the player with a random assortment of power-ups and weapons: jump springs, nitro boosts, rockets, oil slicks, invincibility charges, etc.  The game begins with six of the ten racers (including Woody and Winnie Woodpecker) unlocked; the rest may be obtained by winning tournaments.  A two-player head-to-head racing mode is also supported via the link cable.\n\nThere are two tournament modes: Extreme and Grand Prix, each consisting of the same series of twelve three-track tournaments (spread across sixteen distinct racetracks).  In Extreme, the player must finish in a minimum qualifying position to advance, resulting in a smaller field of challengers as the tournament goes on; Grand Prix adds some additional challenge by keeping the whole field of competitors throughout and ranking racers with points for their finishing positions.  Earning gold trophies in tournaments unlocks points used to equip better car parts for future races across all modes.\n\nAll tracks are also available in two practice modes, Sprint and Time Trial.  Sprint is a single tournament-style race against a full field of AI racers.  Time Trial is a traditional run of an empty track with power-ups disabled; a \"ghost car\" of the player's best trial time may be enabled for reference.",
