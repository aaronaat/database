Your job is simple: save humanity from their own creation -- the ROBOTRONS! The gameplay is pretty unique for the time. You can move and fire in any of eight directions. You get thrown in a room with various evil baddies strewn about, you've got to kill all the robots while at the same time finding some way to grab humans and avoid death.  \n",

      "description": "Brutal Deluxe doesn't live up to their name - in fact they're the worst team Speedball has ever seen. As their manager, it is your job to transform their fortunes. As well as the league system, which consists of 2 8-team divisions and challenges you to advance to the top, there are also 2 cup tournaments, one of which is played out over 2 'legs' with the aggregate score deciding who progresses.\n\nYou can play the matches as well, which is the real meat of the game. They consist of 2 90-second periods, and the gameplay is futuristic, fast and frantic, with heavy tackling encouraged to retrieve the ball. Power-ups and tokens appear on the pitch, including ones to make your players extra-tough or freeze the opponents.\n\nThe sides of the pitch each include a score multiplier, which you can run the ball through to increase the value of your scoring - the opposition can sometimes immediately grab the ball and nullify this. There are also 5 stars which are worth 2 points each if you hit them (more if you have the multiplier activated), but these can also be cancelled out by the opposition hitting the same star, and their points values only become set after the half. Next to the stars there are 'portals' which throw the ball out the opposite side of the pitch, in the direction it was going.\n\nYou get money for the results, and by collecting the silver tokens which appear on the pitch at random intervals. Between each match you can spend these either on improving your existing players as far as they can go, or on buying better ones and fitting them into the team. Your original players can only be improved to a certain extent, so remembering where your signed players are and making use of them is important.\n\nA variety of tokens also appear during the match, some of which boost your team's power for a short period of time, and one freezes the opposition.",

      "description": "<i>Wolfenstein 3D</i> is an episodic first-person shooter and a follow-up to the top-down infiltration game Castle Wolfenstein. The game puts the player in the boots of  B.J. Blazkowicz, an allied spy. There are six episodes: the first distributed complete as shareware; the second and the third available after registration; and the three final missions (which happen before the events of the first episode) available in the Nocturnal Missions pack. \n\nIn the first episode (Escape from Wolfenstein), B.J. is captured, but overpowers a guard with the help of a concealed knife and manages to get out of his cell. Throughout the next nine levels the player guides B.J. searching for an escape from Wolfenstein, guarded by Hans Grosse. After returning to Allied territory, B.J. is given the instructions to Operation: Eisenfaust, where he has to stop Dr. Schabbs and his army of mutant prototypes before they are released into the battlefields. The final mission (Die, F\u00fchrer, Die!) has a simple goal: infiltrate the bunker under the Reichstag, and terminate Hitler (in a robotic suit) himself.\n\nThe Nocturnal Missions are focused on the Nazi plans for chemical warfare, and start with Dark Secret, where B.J. hunts for lead researcher Dr. Otto Giftmacher. It's followed by Trail of the Madman, where the goal is capturing the war plans guarded by Gretel Grosse, and the final episode Confrontation, where B.J. meets General Fettgesicht, the planner for the chemical assault.\n\nEach episode has nine levels (eight regular and a final boss level), plus a secret level activated by an hidden switch somewhere in the eight first levels. Regular levels often feature a maze-like appearance or large areas with many enemies (the number of them on each area depends on the difficulty level), where the player must reach the exit elevator. To do so, he must kill the enemies (while it's possible to move behind the guards' backs and even there's a slight bonus in attacking them from behind, most enemies have to be dealt with by fire power), and depending on the level, activate \"push walls\" and/or get silver and golden keys to open certain doors.\n\nMany objects can be found in a level, from medikits, chicken meals, and even dog food (to restore health), ammo and treasures, which solely exist for points. There are four weapons (knife, pistol, machine gun and Gatling), all of them using the same bullets except the knife. The knife and the pistol are given at the start of the level, while the machine gun is either found (usually in secret areas) or picked up from SS troopers, and the Gatling is always dropped somewhere in the level. There are five kinds of enemies (excluding bosses) - Dogs (fast, but more a nuisance than life-threatening), Army Soldiers (dressed in regular brown outfit, not very powerful but usually found in large groups), Officers (dressed in white, armed with a very accurate pistol and tough to kill), SS Troopers (blue attire, armed with a machine gun and tough to kill), and Mutants (the rarest and toughest of regular enemies, pale-skinned troopers with green clothes and a machine gun stuck in their chest).\n\nThe player character has a number of lives; once he loses the last life, the game ends. To win extra lives, the player has to either find the 1-up item in the level or get 20,000 points (by killing enemies and capturing treasures or completing a level below the 'par' time while killing all enemies, finding all secrets by pushing walls, and collecting all treasure points).",

      "description": "Commonly considered the earliest progenitor of first-person shooters (FPS), <i>Battlezone</i> is a 3D tank game initially released in the arcades, and later converted officially to many systems. Earth has been invaded, and you and your tank lead the defensive effort. You drive around the battlefield from a first-person view, targeting and firing at tanks, planes and UFOs. You have a radar to help you see where the enemies are in direction and distance. Objects can be used as strategic cover. Controls simulate the tracks of a tank realistically, so the direction and speed settings are varied - combining forward right and backward left movements (as you can on keyboard versions) sees you change direction more quickly.",

      "description": "Following the events of the original game, the Pfhor aliens have been defeated and the A.I. known as Durandral has been freed from it's containment. 17 years have passed and Durandral has assembled his own army from the colonists of Tau Ceti, including the Security Officer. Traveling across the galaxy, Durandral finds the home world of the S'pht, a Pfhor slave race, who Durandal liberates and who now worship Durandral as their Messiah. Durandal is searching for the location of a legendary lost tribe of S'pht who may hold the key to his mad quest for... well, whatever he's madly questing for. Unfortunately, the Pfhor dislike Durandral's presence and begin attacking his army. \n\n<i>Marathon 2: Durandal</i> is the sequel to the first Marathon. Although the engine is similar to Doom in most respects (2.5D maps, bitmap sprites instead of polygons, etc.), <i>Marathon 2</i> distinguishes itself with such features such as: a rudimentary inventory system, ambient sound, multiple fire modes for each weapon, allies who aid the player, enemies belonging to different factions which will attack each other, a more developed plot (gradually narrated to the player at various computer terminals scattered throughout the levels (much like System Shock's e-mail transmissions)).\n\nThe game's engine has gained a number of improvements over the original Marathon.  It now displays in a much larger portion of the screen, supports maps with four times the complexity and adds support for liquids and swimming.  All liquids use oxygen when the player is submerged and some also do damage.  Many levels have mechanisms allowing  areas to be flooded or drained, changing the depth of the liquid.\n\nThe other major new feature is a bunch of new multiplayer modes.  The entire single-player portion can be played cooperatively with up to eight players and the game adjusts weapon and monster placement accordingly.  In addition to \"Every Man for Himself\" mode (essentially deathmatch), it now includes \"Kill of the Hill\" where the object is to occupy a designated spot on the map more than anyone else, and \"Kill the Guy with the Ball\" where the object is to hold a skull the longest, the player holding it being unable to fire weapons.",

      "description": "Joanna Dark is an agent for the Carrington Institute, a secret organization funded by anonymous sources and dedicated to protecting the world.  Through their highly trained operatives and special devices (gadgets), Carrington keeps an eye on terrorists, world powers, and strange happenings. The speed in which the dataDyne corporation has established itself through the development of new technologies is starting to worry the institute. So when Carrington receives a message from Dr. Caroll, a scientist wishing to escape dataDyne, they send their best agent, Joanna, to infiltrate the company headquarters.\n\n<i>Perfect Dark</i> is a 3D first-person shooter similar to Rare's earlier GoldenEye 007, though with more of an emphasis on stealth. Joanna can pick up and use a variety of firearms, including shotguns, submachine guns, sniper rifles, various explosives, and others.  In addition she carries quite a few spy gadgets such as IR scanners, night vision, probes, and a deadly laptop. Most weapons have secondary fire modes and reloading them is displayed in an on-screen animation. \n\nShields are scattered through the stages and can be picked up for additional protection. There are no health-restoring items and Joanna cannot jump. Like <i>GoldenEye 007</i>, the game has three difficulty levels, with the higher ones featuring more accurate enemies, less ammo, and more objectives for the player to complete within each mission. Cutscenes with voice acting advance the story between missions.\n\nThe game also features a training mode set in the Carrington Institute. Completing the firing range challenge there unlocks the classic weapons from <i>GoldenEye 007</i>.  In addition, the campaign can be played in a co-operative mode for two human players or one human player and up to three computer-controlled teammates (in split-screen mode), as well as in a \"Counter Operative\" mode, where one of the players takes control of an enemy and tries to stop Joanna from fulfilling her mission. \n\nMultiplayer includes a variety of modes. Among those are the traditional deathmatch as well as the objective-based Capture the Flag and King of the Hill modes. Other scenarios and objectives include surviving as long as possible while carrying a briefcase, hacking computer systems with randomly placed data uplinks, and hunting down a single player as a team. Stages, teams, and weapon placement can be customized by players.\n\nThe Xbox 360 port has redone graphics to support a 1080p full HD resolution at 60 frames per second. It also incorporates full multiplayer support over Xbox LIVE.",

      "description": "Humanity is the midst of a long war against an alien alliance called the Covenant who have been wiping out colony after colony. You hero is Master Chief, who is given no name beyond his rank in the game itself. He is stationed on the Pillar of Autumn, a ship which, per protocol make a jump in a random direction to retreat to avoid revealing the location of Earth. They find themselves at the titular Halo, a planet-sized ring of mysterious origin and function with the Covenant on their heels.  Master Chief must repel the Covenant assault and discover the secrets of Halo with the assistance of the female AI Cortana who lives in his suit and gives missions.\n\n<i>Halo: Combat Evolved</i> is a sci-fi first-person shooter with considerable driving elements. Features include friendly NPCs who fight alongside the Chief, squad-based AI where enemies groups work together to flank you under the direction of a leader unit and can be demoralized by his death. They also use cover, set ambushes, etc.\n\nOnly two weapons may be carried at a time: one active and one on back-up.  There are five human weapons and three Covenant with distinct art styles for the two groups. Human weapons look basically like real guns and fire projectiles. Covenant are sleek and purple and fire energy. For the most part, weapons are not just left around the environment and must be procured from fallen enemies though there are supply points.\n\nYour life is armor and health as in most games of the genre, however, rather than armor being an item than is picked up, it is a force field which quickly recharges itself after several seconds without taking damage, which emphasizes finding cover.\n\nOne of most significant features is vehicles. You can drive a variety of vehicles in both single player and multiplayer, some of which have additional seats for passengers or gunners which can be used by AI characters. Vehicles also come in distinct human and Covenant varieties with their design philosophies.  Human vehicles roll around the ground on wheels and covenant vehicles hover or fly.\n\n<i>Halo</i> also has a significant multiplayer component with basic deathmatch (called slayer here), capture the flag with the unusual addition that the flag takes your weapon spot while you are holding it, so shooting your way in and out of the base on your own is not an option, territories, and some options unique to the game, such as oddball, where you must hold onto a skull for the longest time, race where you score points by getting to checkpoints and juggernaut, where one super-powered player must get points by killing the others and the other players try to kill him to steal his powers. There is also a game editor which allows you to set custom rules for all the basic game types. All the playable weapons and vehicles from the campaign mode are available in the multiplayer maps with the ability for members of the same team to share the game's distinctive Warthog vehicle, which is essentially a small truck with a mounted gun on the back.",

      "description": "Once upon a time, Dr. Brown managed to defeat a mad android known as Golden Silver, who tried to suck out the energy of the planet G-9. Dr. Brown extracted four Mystical Gems, the android's power source, and sealed them on one of the planet's moons, where it was guarded by the four Gunstar siblings. However, years later, a dictator named Smash Daisaku kidnapped Gunstar Green and brainwashed him into telling him where the Mystical Gems were. The dictator is now close to reactivating Golden Silver. The Gunstar twins Red and Blue, guided by their sister Yellow, must find a way to stop Smash Daisaku - but they know that their older brother is on that way...\n\n<i>Gunstar Heroes</i> is a fast-paced side-scrolling shooter. Controlling either Red or Blue Gunstar, the player has access to four basic weapons: Force, rapid shot; Lightning, a straight shot that penetrates enemies; Chaser, a homing weapon; and Flame, a powerful close-ranged. The player can combine two weapons to produce a new one, for a total of fourteen weapons. It is also possible to use melee attacks and moves such as grabbing and tossing enemies, jumping, and sliding.",

Ikaruga is more or less a sequel to Radiant Silvergun by Treasure, on the Sega Saturn.\r\n\r\nBased on a two-colors system, the player has to switch between the black & white sides of his ship during gameplay.\r\nThe black side is immune to black enemy bullets which it consider as bonus, and dies on impact with a white enemy bullets. Your own black bullets damages white enemies twice as more as white bullets. And vice-versa for the white side. Those properties makes a balance between protecting yourself well and killing enemies fast. \r\n\r\nThis aspect, combined with specific enemy patterns and a combo system makes Ikaruga an original shoot-em-up with a dose of strategy.",

      "description": "A millennium has passed since Alis defeated the ultimate evil in the  first Phantasy Star. The planet Motavia of the Algol solar system is no longer the antlion-plagued desert: humans have constructed a sentient computer called \"Mother Brain\", which could regulate the climate of the planet, turning it into a thriving utopia. One night, a young Motavian government agent named Rolf awakens in his bed after having a nightmare. He sees a young girl fighting a demon, but he is unable to help her. Shortly afterwards, he learns that dangerous bio-monsters have broken free from the laboratories, and is sent there to retrieve a recorder that might contain valuable information about the terrible incident...\n\nLike its predecessor, the game is a party-based Japanese RPG with randomly appearing enemies and turn-based combat. Eight characters can join the quest and can be swapped at will to participate in a combat party of four. Characters can equip a wide variety of weapons, including firearms; dual wielding is also possible. Various techniques which require \"TP\" (technique points, equivalent to magic points in comparable games) are learned by different characters at specific levels. Unlike the first game, <i>Phantasy Star II</i> utilizes the same top-down view for both navigation and dungeon exploration; the now-2D dungeons are notable for their complexity.",

You control a space fighter at the bottom of the screen, scrolling left and right in order to avoid oncoming bombs and kamikaze attacks from alien invaders--and to fire your own missiles to fight back!\n\nThere are an infinite number of stages to progress through.  Every third level is a \"challenge stage\" in which you have a free chance to shoot as many aliens as possible and rack up bonus points.\n\nCertain aliens have tractor beams they can use to capture one of your ships.  If that wasn't your last \"life,\" you can try to shoot that alien down and recapture your ship, giving you two ships at once and doubling your firepower.\n\nA summary screen appears when the game is over, giving you both your final score and you final \"hit ratio\"--the number of missiles fired, enemies destroyed, and the percentage of targets hit.",

      "description": "Play the role of a spaceship pilot trapped in a gigantic asteroid cloud and pulverize incoming asteroids with the ship's photon cannon.  When all asteroids are destroyed, the player can then move on to the next round. In addition to the asteroids, the player will also face an Alien Robot Saucer which shoots randomly across the screen.\n\nThe player using the controller may rotate the ship (left or right) to any direction or move the ship forward. Shots will be fired according to the ship direction. The player has three reserved ships available to replace a destroyed spaceship. The spaceship is destroyed if an asteroid collides with the spaceship or is shot by an Alien Robot Saucer. Additionally, the player may opt to use the hyperspace warp to avoid collision. The warp however, may also destroy the spaceship in the process.\n\nAsteroids when shot will break-up into smaller pieces or be destroyed. There are three types of asteroids: large asteroids, medium asteroids, and small asteroids. Large asteroids and medium asteroids when shot, will break-up into two smaller sized asteroids. Small asteroids when shot will be destroyed. \n\nAlien Robot Saucers come in two sizes: small and large. Both use photon lasers to shoot and will explode when destroyed. Alien Robot Saucers will not appear at the Novice Level.\n\n<b>Game Difficulty and Variations</b><br>\nThere are 4 available difficulty settings: Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, and Expert. \n\nThe game also offers three different game variations:<ul>\n<li><b>Standard Play</b> - For one or two players, taking turns when a player's ship is destroyed.</li><br>\n<li><b>Competition Asteroids</b> - Two players appear on the screen at the same time. Friendly fire is in affect, which means shots fired from one player's spaceship will destroy the other player's spaceship. Each player has separate ship reserves.</li><br>\n<li><b>Team Asteroids</b> - Two players on the screen at the same time. Friendly fire is disabled, which means shots fired from one player's spaceship will not destroy the other player's spaceship and just pass through. Ship reserves for both players are combined.</li></ul><b>Scoring</b><br>\nThe score of the Player 1 is viewable on the upper left side of the screen, while Player 2 on the opposite upper right side. A player will be awarded a new reserve ship for every 10,000 points.<ul>\n<li>Small saucer - 1,000 points</li>\n<li>Other player's ship - 500 points</li>\n<li>Large saucer - 200 points</li>\n<li>Small asteroid - 100 points</li>\n<li>Medium asteroid  - 50 points</li>\n<li>Large asteroid - 20 points</li></ul>",

Using rockets, mines and the many other weapons available, you can take down walls, blast through doors (therefore deleting the need for a security key) and bring down enemies by destroying the floor that they stand on. Vehicles can also be used to help in your tasks.\n\nMultiplayer modes are also included for up to 4 players, as well as a collection of bots. As a note, the PC version does not have multiplayer.",

The spaceship is located at the bottom of the screen and it can only stop on one of five beams. You are armed with both lasers and torpedoes; torpedoes are more powerful and can destroy more enemies compared to lasers, however you only get three per level. To complete a sector, you need to destroy fifteen white flying saucers. After all saucers are destroyed, the sector sentinel passes by which can be destroyed for extra points. Each even number sector up until sector 16 will add a new type of enemy to deal with. These additional enemies will just try to slow your mission, though, only the saucers need to be destroyed to advance. Occasionally a rejeuvinator will appear; if this is collected, you can earn an extra life. But be careful, because if you accidentally shoot the rejeuvinator it will turn into an enemy!",

Using your laser blasts, try to destroy the enemy vehicles which appear three at a time. But be careful, they are fully armed with their own lasers and have no intention of letting you take them out easily! The more enemy vehicles you destroy, the more points you earn. If you do get hit by a laser blast, your spacecraft will fall to the ground and crash. When hit you still have one last chance to take out an enemy by maneuvering the spacecraft to crash land on top of it.",

      "description": "As the pilot of an interstellar starship, your mission is to destroy all enemy spacecraft on the galactic chart and prevent them from destroying your starbases. There are three different types of fighters roaming throughout the galaxy; cruisers, fighters, and basestars. With the help of your galactic map, you can find the sectors of the galaxy where these fighters are located and then warp there to destroy them. When all of the fighters in a sector are destroyed, you can warp to a new location for the next battle. Be sure to keep an eye on your starship's energy level; warping to new locations, being hit by enemy fire, or colliding with an asteroid will drain your energy. If you completely run out of energy, your starship will be destroyed, however you can warp back to a starbase to refuel at any time. Returning to a starbase will also repair other types of damage your starship can receive, such as faulty engines, loss of your shields, and faulty photon torpedoes. When all of the enemy ships have been destroyed, you win the game and receive a rank.\n",

You control the fly-like Yar, which can destroy the shield piece by piece by either shooting it or running into it. Once the shield is down, you will need to use the Zorlon cannon to destroy the Qotile. The Zorlon cannon is located on the left side of the screen, and when fired can destroy the Qotile with a direct hit. The Qotile isn't completely unarmed against your attacks, however. Wandering around the screen is a destroyer missile, which will constantly be homing in on your Yar. This missile can not be destroyed, however you can temporarily hide from it in a shield which runs vertically in the center of the screen. The Yar will be unable to fire when hiding in the shield so you can't stay there indefinitely! The Qotiles second weapon is a swirl which it will randomly fire at you and should be dodged. When you finally destroy the Qotile you can move on to the next, faster round of gameplay. Several game variations are included which control the difficulty and speed of the game.",

The aim of the game is to blast everything in sight and try to grab more cash and prizes than the other guy. Toaster ovens, VCRs, fancy cars and luxury holidays are there for the taking... for anyone who can survive long enough to enjoy them.\n\n<i>Smash T.V.</i> is an insane shoot-em-up from the brain of Eugene Jarvis, creator of Robotron: 2084. It retains that game's frantic style of play and two-joystick control method, but adds plenty of gore, violence, a hint of satire and that all-important two player mode.",

They come in various sizes and colors, and some even split into two smaller meteors when shot.\n\nMixed in with the meteors are white spinning bombs. While letting a meteor get past, the player will only lower the score; the player have to shoot the spinners. If one gets past, the player will lose a life. On the more difficult levels, UFOs and guided missiles will also appear occasionally and attempt to destroy the player's cannon.\n\nIf trapped in a hopeless situation, the cannon may enter hyperspace and be instantly transported to a different location on the screen. Just be careful, sometimes the player may be transported to a situation worse than the one the player left! The game ends when all of laser canons have been destroyed.",

Your mission: to destroy the alien station before Earth passes directly over the launch trench. You must evade the alien ships that are defending the launch trench while being sure to bomb the red \"Hot Targets\". The very first red target that is missed when the Earth is directly in the middle of the launch trench becomes a missile. The missile is launched and destroys Earth.",

      "description": "The evil being called Gravitar is out attempting to destroy the universe! With each galaxy he conquers he leaves behind extreme gravitational forces, a powerful, explosive reactor and deadly bunkers. Your job is to stop Gravitar by taking back the twelve solar systems located in four galaxies that are under his control! In each solar system there is a sun, an alien reactor base, and three to four planets. To free the solar system, you have two choices; either visit all of the planets and destroy all enemy bunkers, or activate the reactor at the core of the alien base and escape before it explodes. On each of the planets and the alien base, there will be strong gravitational forces to deal with; make sure you keep your ship in space, since a crash into the ragged landscape will be fatal! After a galaxy has been freed, you then automatically move on to the next galaxy which will be even more difficult to save. The game includes five different skill levels which vary in difficulty by supplying different amounts of ships to begin the game as well as different strengths of gravity.",

Your goal is to earn as many points as possible by shooting the various enemies and space debris. You have a time limit of 2 minutes 16 seconds in the one player versions. In the two player version the time limit is 4 minutes 32 seconds; for half of this time one player will be the star ship commander, and the other will control a space module and needs to dodge the star ships fire. The roles will be reversed for the second half of the time limit.\n\n<li><b>Warp Drive</b></li>These game variations are also played from a first person point of view. Your goal here is to travel as much distance as possible while avoiding the oncoming asteroids.\n\n<li><b>Lunar Lander</b></li>These game variations are played from a third person point of view. You need to pilot your star ship and successfully land on the constantly moving moon. One point is earned for each successful landing, and asteroids and other debris may get in your way and will deduct points if you crash. In the two player versions, one player controls the star ship and the other player controls the moon.\n</ul>\n\nEach of these games feature several variations which control the game speed and level of difficulty.",

      "description": "In the future, on the planet Hillys, the population suffers from constant attacks from the alien DomZ. The situation is gradually getting worse, as the rate of DomZ kidnapings increase. The Alpha Section forces, who are in charge of protecting citizens, seem to be completely ineffective, not even fighting the DomZ. In the midst of this situation, the secretive organization IRIS alleges that the Alpha Section is involved in a massive government conspiracy, and seeks to expose the truth through journalism.\n\nThe player controls a young reporter and photographer named Jade with her companions Pey'j and Double H. After experiencing first-hand a DomZ attack, she is contacted by IRIS, who recruit her as an action reporter. Jade is now tasked with infiltrating the Alpha Section, exposing the government conspiracy, and ultimately finding the truth for herself.\n\n<i>Beyond Good & Evil</i> is an action game with diverse gameplay. Much of the game is based on stealth and puzzles, but there are sequences of racing, shooting, combat, and platform action. Jade fights with her staff and also uses various abilities to execute long-ranged attacks and solve puzzles. Many of the puzzles require switching between the characters and using their special abilities; often it is necessary to coordinate the actions of two characters to achieve precise co-operation that leads to a puzzle's solution. Beside hostile areas with puzzles and enemies, there is also a city and other friendly areas to explore, where various items and gadgets can (and sometimes must) be bought. There are several mini-games and even an online ranking system (used by entering codes online after they are assigned in-game when the game is saved). ",

      "description": "A hundred thousand years ago, an ancient civilization prospered on our Earth, their product being GAMP (General Artificial Matrix Producer). In order to survive the Ice Age, most of the Earth's inhabitants have decided to leave it, finally settling on a planet called Xevious. A group of humans remained, becoming our own ancestors. Many years have passed, and the Xevians are now planning a massive comeback to their long-lost homeland. The pilot Mu, his android companion Eve, and Mio, a Xevian who opposes the GAMP regime, are back from a space travel just in time to warn the Earth of the upcoming invasion. The prototype fighter craft Solvalou is going to be used as the main weapon against the Xevian attack.\n\n<i>Xevious</i> is a vertically-scrolling shooter which is notable for being the first game of that type to feature an aircraft flying over the Earth (as opposed to the outer space in other games), displaying views of South American nature. It also introduced, for the first time, two types of enemies to fight: aerial and ground-based (the menacing SOL towers invoked by GAMP to aid their planes). The player-controlled ship, Solvalou, is equipped with two weapons, each assigned to a button: the Zapper for air enemies, and the Blaster, which drops bombs on ground targets with the aid of a lock-on. The aerial enemies are divided into sub-categories distinguished by their attack and behavior patterns. Certain enemy types are immune to Solvalou's weapons, and must be avoided. ",

Each level consists of several parts. First, you must successfully land the rocket module on the planet surface (this contains your astrobus). This part of the game is similar to the game Lunar Lander; you must control the speed of the lander to make sure you don't crash! In the second, horizontally scrolling segment you control the astrobus and attempt to pick up the commuters at the bus stops. Once all of the commuters are picked up, return to the rocket module and take off to transport the commuters to the grand central space station. Of course, there are many obstacles which can prevent a successful mission. Meteors, fireballs and space mines all get in the way and can destroy your astrobus. Your astrobus is equipped with a laser that can be used to destroy these obstacles. The astrobus also has a limited amount of fuel; if you start running out you better find more fuel before you crash! ",

      "description": "<i>Time Pilot</i> is an arcade style shooter. Piloting your trusty spaceship, you need to destroy the squadrons of enemy craft that are attacking! On each level you have a quota of enemies that need to be destroyed. After fulfilling your quota, a final boss of the level will appear; when destroyed, you will move on to the next level. The game begins in the year 1910, and each time a level is completed you advance in time. In 1910 you only have to face relatively unarmed biplanes, but as the levels advance so does the technology. Each new level brings with it tougher, more heavily armed aircraft including jets, helicopters, and even flying saucers! From time to time, you will encounter a parachute; if you run into this, you will earn bonus points.",

The Collostropolan leaders have decided to solve the problem by invading the neighboring country of Mungola. Since Mungolans are simple, earthy types they don\u2019t expect much of a struggle. Mungola\u2019s defense force consists only of a single squadron of fighter planes \u2013 the F-27 Platypus.\n\n<i>Platypus</i> is a side-scrolling shooter, where you use your little space craft to blast the enemy ships. Shooting some formations gives the player weapon upgrades for twenty seconds. All models in the game were designed in clay, photographed and then digitally coloured. There are 20 levels in four different worlds each with their own themes and enemies.\n\nThe PSP version includes minor changes. It adds worlds, ships, and enemies not in the original game, constructed from existing graphics, with new movement patterns. The weapon balancing and bonus scoring system have been changed. Enhancements include a save system, a new Survival mode and Wi-Fi multiplayer action for 2 players.",

Gameplay is based on the successful standards set by Battlefield 1942, but combat in Battlefront is even more massive and heated, vehicles are more predominant and the familiar starships are also included.\r\n\r\n There are three different game modes to play: Historical Campaign (featuring a series of \"historical\" battles from the Star Wars mythos), Conquest (in which players vie for dominance of individual planets) and, of course, Instant Action. The game puts two pairs of factions at war: Republic vs Separatists and Rebel Alliance vs Galactic Empire. Each faction has four standard unit types (soldier, heavy weapons trooper, scout and pilot) plus a fifth, special unit which differs radically for each side. Famous Jedi and Sith are included as NPCs only in selected battles. Finally, the game offers almost all of the vehicles seen in the movies for players to fly, drive or hover and prevail.",

      "description": "You're a little yellow alien.  The FBI has shot down your ship while flying over planet Earth.  And it, quite literally, lands right on their doorstep.  After a series of FBI Agents swipe your ship, what option do you have other than to blow up everything in your path to get it back?\n\n<i>Alien Hominid</i> is a 2D side-scrolling shooter with heavy references to the Metal Slug series of games - from the hand-drawn graphics, huge explosions, right down to the ability to eviscerate FBI Agents when you get up close to them.  The graphics are by featured artist Dan Paladin.  Your goal, is quite simply, to get to the end of the stage, and die as little as possible.  Which is made difficult due to the fact that any bullet is an instant kill.\n\nTo help you out, you can grab a range of power-ups, such as lasers, spread shots, shotguns and more, as well as hijacking vehicles and using them for protection.  Grenades can be lobbed, and you can jump on enemy shoulders and choose to bite their heads off if you like, or pick them up and throw them at other enemies.  You can also dive underground for a short period of time to avoid enemies - while underground, you can drag agents into the ground to kill them.\n\nThe GBA version of the game is identical in gameplay, however, with a few bosses removed (such as the robot bee and the FBI big-fisted tank robot).  The PlayStation 2, Xbox and Xbox 360 versions of the game include a special \"PDA Game\" with very simple-looking graphics.  Your goal in this game is to kill all the agents by hopping on their heads, and then reach the exit.  Included with this game is a level editor, allowing you to make your own levels and then send them to friends if you have the Xbox or Xbox 360 version.",

You must first reach Bozon\u2019s territories, then wipe out its forces hidden in caverns and lurking in underground seas, before destroying the main invasion ship. Lots of extra weapons can be picked up, often with similar tokens to those in 1943 and some other Capcom titles. Most weapons can be shot either to the left or the right, giving you more range to launch attacks.",

By linking four bricks or more, you create chain reactions. To spice up the gameplay, there are special power-ups such as radial bombs, freeze bombs, column nukes and difficult obstacles such as toxic, steel and stone bricks.\n\nEach of the four playable characters has a <i>supa weapon</i> that destroys all bricks on the screen.

There are two playing modes: <i>Classic</i> with weapon upgrades and 32 levels per character and <i>Survival</i> in which you need to stay alive as long as possible.",

      "description": "<i>RocketBowl</i> is a bowling game with a futuristic twist. It's the 1958 Kalamazoo World's Fair, and it's premiere for the new sport Rocket Bowling. Like in real bowling your objective is to knock down all the pins. But <i>RocketBowl</i> is different in many ways. It's played in a big arena that almost looks like a mini golf courses and it has both hills and curves and different obstacles. You can roll the ball into another frame and there score, making it possible to take out pins in two frames at a shot. Balls are not quite normal either, in <i>RocketBowl</i> the balls are equipped with jets and you have several different balls that you can buy when you have earned enough money. You earn money when you win tournaments or if you hit special dollar bins. The game contains 7 courses and 20 bowling balls. ",

      "description": "At a summer camp for up-and-coming psychics, a young boy with an unusually high level of psychic ability inexplicably shows up. The boy, named Raz, is allowed to stay at the camp until his father comes to pick him up, but his arrival coincides with very strange circumstances. Soon, evidence that someone is psychically tampering with the campers' minds reveals itself, and Raz is the only one who can stop it. Raz must project himself into the psyches of several different people in order to figure out what is going on and who is behind the recent occurrences.\n\n<i>Psychonauts</i> is a 3D platform game with a rather unorthodox style. The characters' inner worlds are the game's levels. Each world reflects the personality of the person whose psyche it represents, often resulting in unique, surreal creations, and influencing the gameplay style. For example, the psyche of a giant lungfish is presented as a large city populated by fish people, in which Raz himself becomes a giant monster who can destroy entire buildings; the psyche of a mental patient is a huge board game, where Raz has to command armies in order to defeat Napoleon, etc.\n\nThere are also many gameplay elements and tasks which are common for all the levels. These include Raz fighting the (not very numerous) regular enemies, defeating level bosses, collecting currency, \"figments of imagination\" needed to upgrade his powers, and bonus items such as complete sets of the character's memories and others. Many of the game's puzzles require the usage of psychic powers, which Raz obtains in a more or less strict order. These powers range from combat abilities such as Psy Shield to Telekinesis (moving objects without touching them) and Clairvoyance (reading other people's minds). \n\nThe camp itself serves as the game's \"hub\", in which the player can explore, interact with characters, search for secret areas and items, and so on.",

Due to some experiments with atomic weaponry, we lack genitalia and the quality of our clones has degraded. Since you pathetic humans all carry Furon DNA in your genetic code, I have been instructed to collect fresh samples. Survival is not an option, but you should be honoured to support the legacy of the Furon Empire!\r\n\r\n<i>Destroy All Humans!</i> is a humorous action game with winks to the era of the goofy fifties' sci-fi movies. Crypto can hypnotize and scan people, and lift objects using psychokinesis. He can also control humans using the Hypno Blast to impose his commands. Extracted DNA can be exchanged in your mothership for new weapons and ability upgrades. Furon weaponry includes a Zap-o-Matic, disintegrator ray, abducto beam, quantum deconstructor and even the famous anal probe. Not to be overpowered, you have to disguise yourself using the Holobob. There are different alert levels, similar to the Grand Theft Auto games and if you are not careful, you will be hunted down by the police, military or the government.\r\n\r\nYou are constantly in contact with the mothership, where you can purchase upgrades, save the game and apply for new missions. Crypto does not have to run all the time, he can also use his flying saucer to abduct humans or animals, cause havoc or face bigger threats. Next to the story-based missions, you will also be instructed to collect specific samples or kill a certain amount of humans in a race against time.",

Here you will engage and destroy them before they can surround and destroy your starbases.   In a starbase sector, use your joystick to guide your reticle to the starbase when it is near you for repair and/or refueling. In a fight, you can take damage. If you see a L, it meas your lasers are out of commission. This mean you cannot fire (this is not good in a fight!). If you see a W, it means your warp drive is damaged. You will use twice as much fuel when warping. If you see an S, it means your shields are out. If you are hit again with no shields, you will be destroyed. If you see an R, it means your radar is damaged. You will not be able to see the enemies on the starmap until you get the radar fixed. All your starbases will still show with damaged radar except any that have been destroyed. When warping, if the screen at the bottom is green, you are headed to an empty sector. If it is red, you are headed to a sector with enemies in it. If it is blue, you are headed to a sector with a starbase in it. The game ends when either all the enemies are destroyed or you are destroyed. Your final score is determined by your base score plus 100 points per enemy destroyed minus 500 points per starbase destroyed minus 100 points per each time you docked at a starbase minus 1 point per stardate.",

      "description": "January 2009. On a cold, snowy night in New York City, an ordinary citizen named Lucas Kane, under the control of an unknown force, unwillingly murders a complete stranger in a diner. Once he comes to senses, Lucas realizes he must escape while leaving as little evidence as possible behind. Barely managing to accomplish that, Lucas contacts his brother and tries to understand what has caused him to commit the crime, recalling the events of his own past in the process. Meanwhile, two police detectives investigating the murder, Carla Valenti and Tyler Miles, are determined to find the perpetrator, at the same time trying to deal with the personal problems of their lives.\n\n<i>Indigo Prophecy</i> (<i>Fahrenheit</i> in Europe) is a psychological thriller in which the player is able to control different characters on both sides of a murder - the killer and those who are trying to find him. The game's core gameplay style is adventure. The three protagonists explore various locations, talk to other characters, and interact with the environment in order to advance. However, the game is heavy on various action-oriented sequences, from tasks that must be completed within a limited amount of time to quick time events, which require the player to press the correct button during a scene.\n\nThe game emphasizes realism in the player's interaction with the environment. For example, picking up a rag and cleaning the floor requires the player to  move the mouse or the analog stick back and forth, imitating the actual movements of the object. Dialogue with character often imposes time limits on the player; failure to choose the optimal response in time will prompt the game to choose another, not always the optimal one. The player's choice will sometimes influence the subsequent events and the outcome of the entire story, eventually leading it to one of the three possible endings.\n\nCinematic treatment is evident in the game's handling of action-based gameplay and cutscenes, which are often seamlessly integrated into each other. An example of this is the split-screen technique, which is often used during the game's most dramatic moments: while the player is trying to complete the required action in time on one screen, another one displays what is happening around the controlled character.",

      "description": "Quake 4 is the true sequel to Quake II, continuing the Strogg vs. Humans storyline from the point where Quake II ended. The Strogg is an alien cyborg race which, much like the Star Trek Borg race from which they seem to be partly inspired, wander the galaxy conquering planets and wiping civilizations. Their sole purpose is to collect organic body parts with which to swell their ranks. After a prolonged war, the united armed forces of Earth decided to launch a desperate counter attack on the home planet of the invaders, Stroggos. By some twist of fate a sole marine was able to disable the Strogg main planetary defense (aka The Big Gun) and kill Makron, their leader. That was the end of Quake II. The second wave of attack is meant to land on Stroggos and take advantage of the brief disorder, ending the threat of the Strogg forever. Of course it will not be that easy...\r\n\r\nThis time the lone soldier theme (of Quake I, II and the Doom series) is replaced by a war. Not as large scale as a military FPS or even Halo, but close enough. There are squad mates, some of which are important to protect, some vehicles (a hovertank and a mech) and frequently changing objectives to achieve. The arsenal contains elements from all Quake games (nailgun, rail gun, lightning gun) and the classic BFG has been replaced by the Dark Matter Gun. Weapons can be improved later in the game, making them much more effective. The game uses a somewhat improved version of the Doom 3 engine to good effect. Multiplayer options are rather limited, offering only the standard Deathmatch modes and CTF.\r\n\r\nQuake 4 was developed by Raven under the guidance of id Software.",

      "description": "<i>Stubbs the Zombie in Rebel Without a Pulse</i> is a 3D action game that turns the tables on the age old tradition of zombie games. In this game, you play as the zombie, fight off the humans, and eat their brains. Stubbs the Zombie is set in a retro-futuristic city of the future and follows Stubbs over the course of one day as he zombifies the entire city.\n\nBefore becoming a zombie Edward 'Stubbs' Stubblefield was a traveling salesman in the 1930s who got himself killed. Flash forward to 1959 where the world's richest man, Andrew Monday, has built his dream city, Punchbowl Pennsylvania, on top of poor Stubbs' grave. Stubbs will have to claw through all of Punchbowl's citizens, including the local police department, crazy militiamen, nerdy scientists, and a deadly barbershop quartet.\n\nLuckily Stubbs has some help. Every human that he kills comes back as a zombie and joins Stubbs in his quest for brains. Stubbs also learns a series of special body powers. He can use his unholy flatulence to stun enemies, he can throw his pancreas as an exploding zombie grenade, and he can detach his own head and bowl it into enemies. Stubbs' most powerful ability is that he can detach his hand and use it as a scout, climbing up walls and the ceiling, and then use it to take control of enemy humans and their weapons.",

      "description": "<i>Perfect Dark Zero</i> is a prequel to the Nintendo 64 game Perfect Dark, set years before the original game. Joanna Dark is not yet the perfect agent, so it's up to the player to get her there. Like the original, \"Zero\" is also a first person shooter with plenty of sci-fi gadgets and weaponry - some familiar, some new.\n\nWorking as a bounty hunter, she and her father Jack accidentally step on toes of shadowy corporations and reveal a global conspiracy. Changing their destinies forever, Joanna and Jack find themselves fighting for the future of the entire planet.\n\nYou can carry up to four different weapons, but bigger guns take more inventory space, meaning you can pack several pistols but only one machine gun at a time. Carrying bigger weapons also affect your running speed. There is no jump button, but the game features smart tactical options depending the scene; from a touch of a button you can take cover behind obstacles, perform athletic rolls, ... You can even disarm your opponents by grabbing their guns out of their hands.\n\nIn addition to espionage thriller single player game, there are also many multiplayer options, including four-player split-screen and cooperative play. Xbox Live adds few new ideas and twists to familiar game modes, like fully scalable environments. There is also built-in ranking system via Live.",

      "description": "<i>Dreamfall</i> is the sequel to The Longest Journey and is a third-person adventure game with a few action episodes.\n\nThe game begins in Casablanca, 2219. Zo\u00eb Castillo is about to get involved in a conspiracy that spans across two worlds: the one she grew up in, and a mysterious magical realm. There has been static interference that is disrupting technology, and it seems to be linked to a little girl seen only by Zo\u00eb.  As Zo\u00eb begins her search for a lost friend, she discovers the truth about the two worlds and the search is now on for the one person who may help Zo\u00eb unravel the dangerous web she has become entangled in: April Ryan.\n\n <i>Dreamfall</i> puts the player in control of three characters. It also introduces the focus field feature, which allows the player to scan an entire visible environment as seen by the characters and also use it to eavesdrop into other people's conversations. There are a few fighting sequences in the game, and a few instances where the player can choose to fight a character or opt to solve the confrontation in a peaceful way. The game spans 13 chapters; like April in the previous game, Zo\u00eb keeps a diary of all the events that occur in the game.",

Fresh from the flight-academy he learns from an good friend of his father, that his mysterious death was caused by sabotage. As a last gift from his father, he gets the ownership of the one-of-a-kind ship Darkstar One and now makes his way to find out the truth behind his fathers death.\n\nDarkstar is a mix of Freelancer and Wing Commander: Privateer as you can fly your ship either with a mouse or a joystick. \n\nAs you solve the riddle you can visit 330 star-systems in which you can trade goods from other systems, take contracts like blasting a pirate gang out of the sky or try to be a pirate yourself. Every action influences the reputation with at least one faction and the game gives you total freedom in what you want to do or what career you want to pursue.\n\nIt is also possible to search for artifacts. As opposed to other games of this type, you don't buy a bigger ship. Through the whole game you only fly the Darkstar One. You upgrade the ship through artifacts you found in asteroids. If you have enough artifacts for an upgrade, you can boost the basic attributes of the ship. This enables you to install more and bigger weapons or goodies like a shield-booster.",

      "description": "When Tommy, a garage mechanic, defends his girlfriend in a bar fight in a Native American reservation in Oklahoma, the entire bar, along with everyone inside, is sucked into a shuttlecraft. They are transported into The Sphere, an enormous, organic alien ship. Tommy is set free by one of the denizens and his task is to save his girlfriend Jen and grandfather Enisi, and find out what the meaning of The Sphere is.\n\nThis 3D-shooter, based on a modified version of the Doom 3 engine, takes place entirely inside the gigantic ship. As a combination of organic and cybernetic structures, gravity is defied: with the proper grids activated, you can walk on walls and ceilings. There are also multiple dimensions inside the ship you can cross using portals. During his quest, Tommy struggles with his Native American lineage. The ghost-like hawk Talon is always on your side and you sometimes cross over to another land to get help from your grandfather. Tommy can also shift to Spirit Walk, an alternate dimension in the game to get past obstacles and solve puzzles. When you die, you are also transported to another realm where you have to shoot lost souls with your spirit bow before being sent back. Your new health and spirit status will be based on your performance there.\n\nThe weapons Tommy uses are usually organic, with secondary fire functions. The arsenal includes a wrench, a rifle, crawlers, an acid sprayer, an auto cannon, a leech gun (chargeable with fire, ice, red orbs or lightning), a rocket launcher and the spirit bow. Certain parts of the game require you to explore large areas in a flying pod. You can use it to engage enemies or use the tractor beam to move objects. Navigation, often with a distinct lack of direction, is reminiscent of Descent then. Puzzles usually require you to decipher codes, activate switches and find entrances.\n\nThe game supports OpenAL and EAX HD surround sound, and multiplayer games for up to eight players in duel or team deathmatch. Although the game is developed by Human Head Studios, it is produced and was originally designed by 3D Realms.",

      "description": "Get ready for hectic, fast paced action with Geometry Wars!  Take the role of a lone spaceship as you combat swarms of assorted brightly colored shapes which attack you with their own different patterns.  There's the basic Pinwheels, the unstable Black Holes, which attempt to suck you (and enemies) in, the long, dangerous Snakes, to name but a few.  Each enemy explodes in a dazzling shower of sparks, and it can quickly become difficult to navigate through space as you try to avoid enemies and ignore the explosions.\n\nGeometry Wars: Retro Evolved actually contains two games in one.  The first version is <i>Retro</i>, which was originally included as a secret game in Project Gotham Racing 2.  <i>Retro</i> features a 4:3 aspect ratio, and fewer graphical effects.\n\nThe other, more popular version of the game is <i>Evolved</i>, which was also included in Project Gotham Racing 3. This version of the game can be played in a 16:9 aspect ratio, and features more intense graphics and special effects. Also, you can only get a maximum of nine ships and nine lives, while there was an unlimited number in the original game. Finally, the playing area is smaller, not revealing the entire field, but scrolling has been added instead.\n\nHowever, the core game is the same for both versions: shoot everything, and don't get shot or hit yourself.  You control your ship with the left analog stick, and fire your weapon in any direction by using the right analog stick. Your ship's weapon automatically upgrades every 2,500 points, to help you destroy ships more quickly.  here are also 'smart bombs', which can be activated by using either the L or R trigger button.  Smart Bombs clear the field of all enemies - however, many more will quickly take their place!",

You manage an interstellar space station with various ports that can be equipped for space travellers, constantly balancing operating costs against revenue. You can focus on entertainment, commercial activities or science, but you also have to construct buildings, provide enough power and repair all your structures. Every port can be micromanaged for content and price, and you can upgrade to new expansions and sell the old ones. At the same time, you have to keep an eye out for alien attacks or asteroids.\n\nThere are two story modes: Adventure and War, with goals for each mission, based on shielding off attacks, constructing buildings or getting revenues. There are seven races and 50 space stations to play with. Like most tycoon games, there is also a sandbox mode where you can play without objectives or restrictions. Soon after the release, additional scenarios and picture packs were made available.",

Any that reach the outside are fatal to touch, thus limiting your range of movement greatly if 2 or more achieve this. Some aliens move sideways - in dealing with these, plan ahead allowing for the time your shots to take to travel.\n\nYou have a Super Zapper, which can be used once on each level to wipe out all aliens currently active, but this scores no points.",

      "description": "The Legos strike back in the sequel to the original LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game, where players now get to explore the original trilogy (Episodes IV, V, and VI) of the <i>Star Wars</i> movie series. Players use LEGO-ized Star Wars characters to reenact all three of the original movies. All of the sets and props are also made out of LEGO bricks, and retain their properties such as the ability to be rebuilt and fall apart.  Like its predecessor, the game puts a spin on the series by adding a light-hearted, humorous touch to the movies, and also by using no dialogue.  \n\n<i>LEGO Star Wars II</i> is a third-person action game with platforming elements. Players take control of the characters and vehicles of Star Wars. In Story Mode, players reenact the key events of the original movies with LEGO bricks. Each character has different weapons, like lightsabers for Jedi or crossbows for Wookies, as well as new character-specific attacks and maneuvers. Each character also has different abilities, e.g. Jedi being able to use the force, R2-D2 being able to unlock doors, or Boba Fett being able to use his jetpack. It is up to the player to use these abilities to solve simple puzzles and traverse the levels of the game. Vehicle levels are more prominently featured than in the previous game, with longer sequences dedicated to piloting traditional Star Wars aircrafts.\n\nIn addition to a single-player game, there is also a co-op mode that allows two players to go through the Story Mode. In the single-player mode, the second character is controlled by the AI. Like in the first game, the Free-play mode allows players to go back and replay beaten levels with any playable character they have unlocked. A new feature allows players to create their own mixed-up LEGO characters and vehicles. Power Brock items and coin stubs collected in Story Mode will also unlock new characters, vehicles, and items for players to experiment with.  ",

      "description": "Dr. Doom has united supervillains as the Masters of Evil. Now for the first time ever, over 20 Marvel superheroes including Spider-Man, Captain America, Wolverine, Ghost Rider, Blade and Silver Surfer have come together to stop Doom. Mix and match your choice of Marvel superheroes, in teams of four as you travel across the Marvel Universe to stop this threat. Certain teams such as The Fantastic Four and The New Avengers provide additional bonuses.\n\nSome heroes must be unlocked first. The game also features RPG elements, such as leveling up. When a hero gains a level, they earn points you can use to upgrade their skills. You also collect Shield Coins, which can be spent on boosts for your hero team. \n\nYou explore various legendary Marvel locales, from Asgard, to Prince Namor's Atlantis, where you take on foes with punches, kicks and super powers. Super powers drain energy, however, so use them wisely. Combos can be achieved by combining super powers. Energy is restored by collecting blue orbs from fallen foes. \n\nBoss battles are like the comics themselves: titanic battles that often not only test brawn but your brain as well. With over 20 playable heroes plus all the cameos, there are over 100 heroes and villains.\n\nThe game modes feature either single player, co-op, or online play. In general, Marvel Ultimate Alliance's gameplay can be considered an improved version of 2004's X-Men: Legends. The different versions are fairly identical. The PSP release has three more game modes, while Wii, PS3 and Xbox 360 have additional levels.",

You control the man himself as he flies around Metropolis, saves citizens and fights natural disasters, fires and supervillains alike.\n\nYou have constant access to Superman's powers including heat vision, freeze breath, invulnerability and flight at supersonic speeds, though the former two are limited by a stamina bar.  Unusually for this genre, Superman himself does not take damage and the challenges are all built around saving others from harm.\n\nCombat is accomplished through melee (you learn new combos as you progress in the game) as well as direct application of Superman's heat vision and freeze breath. Additionally, you may pick up objects, from the Daily Planet globe to tanker trucks, to throw at villains. You can also rip down a lamppost and use it as a club.\n\nMetropolis is presented as a wide open world where you can fly anywhere and perform any of the side missions at any given time.  Besides the main story missions, there are 200 kittens to rescue and many fires to put out.\n\nThe basic game is broken up a bit with two rather different sequences. There is a race around the city against Myxyzptlk and a Bizarro mode, in which you must destroy the city.",

Starfleet is growing fast and new technologies have been introduced like the tractor beam or starbases. You take the helm of the starship Enterprise NX-01 which has been heavily upgraded with all the cutting edge technology and your mission is to find a missing Vulcan ship. During the campaign you play get the chance to play all the great ships from the five series up to the USS Voyager under the command of Captain Janeway. All five captains (Archer, Kirk, Picard, Sisko, Janeway) are voiced by their actors from the TV-series.\n\nYou control your ship either directly with the keyboard or by giving orders to your helm on a map of the current sector or by marking planets or enemies in directly on the screen. Depending on how good you solved a mission, you earn command points with which you can buy up to 4 ships. They function like a squad. You can either give them individual commands like defend this position or take the lead and tell them to do, what you do. If you aren't satisfied with the actions of your individual ships, you can take over the helm yourself at any time.\n\nDuring the campaign you only take control over ships of the United Federation of Planets and fight against Klingons, Romulans and the Borg. But in skirmish as well as in multiplayer, you can take either side yourself and fight against up to 4 other players or together against a common threat in coop in which each player takes control over one ship of the squad.\n\nAlso there's much fighting with enemy ships, your mission goals include escorting medical ships to poisoned planets or defending planets against incoming asteroids.",

      "description": "<i>Gears of War</i> is a tactical third-person shooter where the player controls Marcus Fenix, a member of Delta Squad, to save the human inhabitants of the fictional planet Sera from an enemy known as The Locust Horde. The story, played over 5 acts with 30 chapters in total, has the humans reunite their strength after fighting over cheap energy in the Pendulum Wars for many years, to face this new alien threat.\n\nUnlike many other shooters, the emphasis is not on brute violence, but rather team-based actions and cover-dependent tactics. Gameplay requires to look for cover options all the time, from which the player then attacks, along with turns and rolls to quickly pop out. By holding a button, a \"roadie run\" is performed, to sprint to another location. Marcus is part of a full squad, but another human player can take on the role of Dominic Santiago to fight cooperatively (split-screen, system link or online). At times, the paths will even be split up to face different challenges. Players can only hold two weapons, a sidearm, and a few grenades. There is a selection of submachine guns, sniper and assault riles, grenades, grenade launchers, and pistols, but the main gun is the COG Lancer Assault Rifle, which can also be used as a chainsaw bayonet in close combat. There are also a few exotic weapons, such as the Torque Bow with explosive arrows, or the Hammer of Dawn, to make an orbiting satellite fire a laser at targeted enemies.\n\nAll weapons need to be reloaded manually. By timely pressing a button on a meter, the weapon is reloaded, with more damage and at a faster rate with perfect timing, or it gets jammed when timed poorly. Instead of health bar, the game has the Crimson Omen, a cog-shaped icon that fills up with blood when the player sustains damage.\n\nNext to the Co-op multiplayer, there is also Versus, with three game modes: Warzone (deathmatch), Execution (deathmatch, but with the addition of certain \"fatalities\" to take out enemies completely) and Assassination (team played focused on killing the opponent's team leader).",

The racers are dropped into futuristic arenas to race and fight for their lives. Next to free play and arcade, this Xbox Live Arcade title also offers a career mode. There are different cars to choose from (24, with unlockables) and the initial abilities (power, defense, attack, and grip) can be boosted through power-ups inside the arenas. The 15 courses come with different game modes, such as deathmatch, beacon blast (checkpoint racing), survivor (last man standing), wrecking ball (demolition derby), hounded (tag racing), bot hunt, and more.\n\nThe arenas are bright, with obstacles and ramps. Opponents can be taken out with weapons to score points, but in beacon blast the ranking can also be improved by racing through beacons. As soon as one is passed, it reappears at another location. The standard weapon is a feeble laser, but five more become available later on, such as the plasma cannon, electricity blaster, flame-thrower, repel gun and gravity gun. There is no need to aim however, as all weapons automatically lock on to opponents. Next to the offline mode for a single player, up to 8 human players can race together online. Players can also unlock a fifth game type, SuperNova, and there are 12 achievements.",

      "description": "Mankind left Earth 80 years ago in order to build a life on the planet E.D.N. III. As the colony grew, humanity encountered The Akrids, a bug-like alien race that declared war on the humans for intruding on  their territory. The humans didn't have any effective means to defend themselves and had to retreat from the planet. During the course of the retreat, a young man named Adam had his father killed by a Akrid named \"Green Eye\". Scientists soon discovered that the Akrids were a source of precious thermal energy, stored inside their bodies. This needed resource gave humanity an economical reason to fight back. On Earth, the Vital Suit was developed, a heavy weapon mech-like vehicle, Returning to E.D.N. III, Adam is among the many Vital Suit pilots, and seeks to avenge his father's death.\n\n<i>Lost Planet: Extreme Condition</i> is a 3rd-person shooter. Controlling Adam, the player makes war on the Akrid armies. Adam's main objective is to destroy Akrid hives, and ultimately defeat \"Green Eye\" but there will be several goals for him to complete along the way.  Adam can hold two weapons and one type of grenade at the same time. In addition, Adam can find different Vital Suit upgrades to give himself new abilities. Since it's very cold on the planet, thermal energy is needed to survive and restores health energy. In order to get it, Adam can either activate Data Posts or destroy things that have it in them like exploding barrels or enemy Akrids. The thermal energy stored slowly decreases over time and needs constant replenishing.\n\n<i>Lost Planet: Extreme Condition</i> also features a multiplayer mode where players can go online and play in four different game-modes against up to 16 other players. Besides the usual Deathmatch and Team-deathmatch; there is \"Station Control\", where players try to find and activate data posts on the map and \"Fugitive\", where one player flees from all the rest killing opponents and waiting for the timer to count down.",

      "description": "Take to enemy territory in your heavily armored tank as you attempt to infiltrate an underground laboratory.  Fight your way through waves of mechanical foes and infantry alike, and if the going gets too tough, team up with a friend.  You can even hop out of your tank when you need to squeeze into tight spots to access secret areas!\n\n<i>Assault Heroes</i> is a top-down auto-scrolling shooter, similar to Commando.  However, instead of merely tackling foes on foot, you've got a tricked-out tank at your disposal, complete with nukes, guns, flamethrowers, shotguns, and more - and don't forget that your weapons are fully upgradeable!  If your tank takes too much damage, it will explode and you'll have to tough it out on foot while you wait for it to respawn.  In addition, some sections can only be accessed on foot, and there are also underground bases to conquer.  These are much tougher, as it's easier to die as a mere soldier than an armored tank.",

You play as a bad-ass soldier dude who will single-handedly wipe the aliens out.\n\nYou travel around each level in a non-linear fashion.

You are a Supreme Commander and you have to take one of the sides and put an end to this war.\n\nAs in most strategy games, you have to build up a base, gather resources and build armies to fight off your enemies. But being created by Chris Taylor of Total Annihilation fame, the RTS also has many unique features, such as a huge unit cap of 500 units per side, different resource management, queue up commands and waypoints, diverse unit types and even dual screen support.\n\nPlayers can play through the Campaign and carry on the story as one of the sides, or fight off computer enemies in Skirmish and human opponents in Multiplayer.\n\nThe Xbox 360 version has redesigned controls and HUD. The game uses circular controls to replace the many short-cuts and buttons. The right stick is used to zoom in or out quickly. It also includes new units, updated maps and two new multiplayer modes (King of the Hill - defend a strategic point, and Command Point - capture as many civilian buildings as possible), available to play over Xbox Live with four players simultaneously.",

      "description": "It's time to take back the streets!  With Pacific City under the iron grip of three ruthless gangs: Los Muertos, the Volk, and the Shai-Gen Corporation; the last hope rests on The Agency, a highly skilled group of law enforcers.  But the situation is dire, and desperate times call for desperate measures.  Using technology from one of Shai-Gen's scientists, The Agency is creating superhuman Agents to combat the crime and take back the city.  With constantly evolving skills which increase as you use them, you've certainly got the upper hand... but these gangs won't give back Pacific City without a fight!\n\n<i>Crackdown</i> is an action game from the creator of Grand Theft Auto; and presents the player with the fully explorable world of Pacific City.  Your main goal is to defeat the gangs that have taken over various parts of the city.  You're quite welcome to tackle each gang's head honcho straight off; however, it's to your advantage to take down the lower rungs in the gang ladder before you head for the top.  Doing so will cripple various parts of the gang, such as vehicles, cash flow, and new recruits.\n\nYour Agent can upgrade particular types of skills: Agility - your running speed and jump height; Driving - your control of different types of vehicles; Explosives - your skill and damage radius of explosives; Strength - your physical strength, which allows you to punch, as well as lift and throw heavier objects; and Weapons - your skill and accuracy with assorted types of weaponry.  Each type of skill is increased by performing the associated action.  Drive around and your Driving skill will increase, punch people in the face or throw garbage skips at them to increase your strength, and keep up the shooting to improve your weapon skills.  Agility is measured differently - scattered throughout Pacific City are green Agility Orbs.  Nab these, and your Agility will increase.  The higher up the orb is, the more it's worth.  You can also increase your Driving and Agility skills even further via special races which can be found around the city.",

      "description": "In the distant future humanity will develop intelligent weapons called Trigger Hearts. Despite their awesome offensive strengths, Trigger Hearts aesthetically closely resemble humans, and overtime even develop unique personalities. Of three existing Trigger Hearts one, named Faintear, has mysteriously vanished two years ago.\nThe story begins as the two remaining Trigger Hearts - Exelica and Crueltear (who took on the personality of Exelica's big sister) are summoned to quell a mysterious rebellion of military machines against their human creators.\n\nTrigger Heart Exelica is an arcade-style top-down shooter and is composed of 5 stages of shooting mayhem. Most levels take place in futuristic environments such as sky cities and space stations. The player is given a choice of one of the two Trigger Hearts at the beginning of the game - Exelica, who emits a wide fan of weak shots, and Crueltear, who fires a narrowly concentrated barrage of projectiles. However, the firing pattern of guns matters little during the game, as Trigger Heart's most awesome weapon is common to both models, and is called the Anchor Shot. By using the Anchor Shot Trigger Hearts are able to grab, swing, use as a shield, and hurl back any flying enemy vehicle in the game, including even the most giant of enemy battle cruisers. When thrown, the enemy cuts a path of destruction across the entire screen, causing explosive chain reactions between adjacent ships and occasionally even obliterating bosses in one hit. The Anchor Shot is a tricky weapon to use, as it requires the player to circle the joystick in order to give enemy ships more inertia while continuing to dodge enemy fire. The trajectory of the released enemy is also somewhat difficult to predict. Another innovative feature of Trigger Heart Exelica is AI-adjusted boss difficulty level, which will cut more slack to the inexperienced player, while attempting to punish the pros.\n\nIn addition to the original Arcade mode the home version of the game includes a Story mode, which adds fully voiced cutscenes, additional endings and bosses throughout the game, and Arranged Mode, which is just like the arcade mode, but is limited to Normal difficulty, no continues, and only two lives, and serves as a challenge to the most experienced players.\n\nThe PS2 port includes a new opening movie, story mode and CG sequences. TH44 Faintear is now a player selectable fighter and The Triggerheart Backupper C'r_na, originally only a story concept, now appears in the game.",

      "description": "As a delivery pilot for the Acme Interstellar Transport Company, you're sent to far off distant planets to deliver rocket ship kits to planets across the galaxy.  While on your spacewide trip, you decide to take advantage of the situation by grabbing as much treasure on each planet as you can find.  Blast any unfriendly inhabitants that get in your way, and then jet off to the next planet and do it all again!\n\n<i>Jetpac Refuelled</i> is a combination of two games in one.  The first is the original Jetpac for the Sinclair Spectrum.  In this game, you must construct a rocket ship by guiding Jetman to the two extra ship pieces, and dragging them back to the ship's base.  From there, grab six fuel packs to fill the rocket with fuel, and when it's full, jump inside and blast off to the next planet and refuel your built ship.  Many different aliens try to kill you as you perform this task - so shoot them with your trusty laser.  You can also thrust with your jetpack to dodge them.\n\n<i>Refuelled</i> takes the basic addictive gameplay of the original <i>Jetpac</i> and enhances it, as well as adding new graphics and sound.  Your laser becomes upgradable: aside from the standard shot, you can get a dual shot which shoots straight up as well as forward, and a spread shot, which shoots three directions in front of you.  Collecting a laser powerup after the spread shot increases your laser's power and starts you with the initial laser again.  EMP Bombs can also be collected and clear the screen of all foes when you're in a pinch.",

      "description": "<i>Earth Defense Force 2017</i> is the third game in the Chikyuu Boueigun series well know in Japan, and the first one released in North America (the previous two Chikyuu Boueigun were released in Europe under the names <i> Monster Attack</i> and <i>Global Defence Force</i> respectively). The game is a third-person 3D shooter featuring fights with floods of large enemies on gigantic, sprawling maps.\n\nThe game's story, which seems to be a re-telling of Monster Attack as it is set in 2017 (Global Defence Force takes place in 2019 and indicates that Monster Attack occurred two years earlier), places the player in the role of an EDF infantry man tasked with defending the Earth from hordes of alien invaders. The game features 53 missions where you fight against aliens on city streets, in underground caves and on coastal zones. You have access to 170 weapons divided into 7 categories including assault rifles, rocket launchers, flamethrowers, grenades and more. \n\nYou unlock new weapons throughout the game by picking up Weapon objects, dropped by killed enemies. Weapon objects provide you random weapons including those the character already has. On some maps there are also helicopters, battlemechs, tanks and bikes that can be controlled.\n\nThe Xbox 360 version features 2-player split-screen multiplayer where you can play cooperative or versus battle. The PS Vita version has an online cooperative multiplayer mode for up to four players.\n\nEarth Defense Force 2017 is the first game in the series that features AI controlled EDF forces on its maps; in both previous games, the player fought completely by themselves, despite supposedly being in an army. Unlike Global Defence Force, the radio chatter from the Japanese version was retained for the English release.",

      "description": "One day a meteor fell on Earth, spreading a new substance called Tiberium. This substance was unusual and powerful, yet highly dangerous since it turned anything it touched into Tiberium itself. By 2047, Tiberium has spread and infested most of the Earth's surface, causing an ecological catastrophe. Red Zones are areas rendered inhabitable due to the severe Tiberium infestation and constant Ion storms, covering 20% of the planet's surface. Yellow Zones are areas infested by Tiberium but they hold most of the world's population. These areas are filled with civil unrest and are war-torn and ravaged but cover 50% of the planet's surface. The remaining areas are Blue Zones, areas safe from Tiberium infestation and possibly the only salvation for humanity, covering 20% of the planet's surface.\n\nThe Global Defense Initiative upkeeps the Blue Zones, keeping them defended and using special technology to keep the Tiberium infestation at bay, while the Brotherhood of Nod takes advantage of the chaos and civil unrest in the Yellow Zones to recruit their forces. However, they hadn't been heard of for years, supposedly disappeared... until now. Kane returns, commanding the Brotherhood of Nod once again to launch a serious assault against the Global Defense Initiative and its Blue Zones, starting the Third Tiberium War.\n\nFollowing the tradition of the series, <i>Command & Conquer 3</i> is designed to be a fast-paced game, where players build up their bases to produce a powerful fighting force to destroy their enemies. Being able to play for any of the three sides, they'll have a huge selection of infantry, vehicles and aircraft to fight with, as well as structures to aid with new technologies, upgrades and the all-powerful superweapons. Unlike most games of the genre, players do all their building from a tabbed sidebar, allowing them to create production queues and deploy structures quickly and easily. Maps also have various buildings spread around which can either be garrisoned to provide further protection or captured to give players that extra edge.\n\nIn campaign mode you can fight the war for one of the games sides, playing out the storyline through various missions with high-definition FMVs and popular actors giving you orders, and winning medals based on your performance. You can also play in skirmish against the AI, or in multiplayer (network/online) against human/computer players. Online play has support for rankings, clans, VoIP, and a new feature called BattleCast, enabling players to watch or download replays from battles directly from the website, or even provide commentary like an online sport.\n\nThe Xbox 360 version is fairly identical but altered for the console's controls. The interface has been moved to the bottom left on the screen and the tabs on the right have been replaced by context-sensitive menus players can scroll through using the D-pad. Selecting and building units or constructions is done through the A-button and the triggers. The buildings show processes without having to select them. A tutorial explains the controls and advanced players can also create custom shortcuts. The Xbox 360 version supports the Xbox Live Vision camera.",

      "description": "After 5.000 years magic, that was believed to be dead, is rediscovered and the RNA Global wants to take it for themselves just to have the power. A group called Lineage decides not to let that happen. They want to preserve the magic for everyone on the planet. A war ensues. \n\n<i>Shadowrun</i> is a first-person shooter set in the cyberpunk-urban fantasy cross-genre based on the license of the same name, but not set in the same universe. Instead, the developer created an alternate continuity. The game takes place in Brazil in 2031, before the events that of the actual Shadowrun universe.\n\nAfter the six chapters of the tutorial the player can either choose to fight against bots or go online and play against up to 15 other players in the three different game modes: Deathmatch, Capture the Flag and Artefacthunt. Each team can choose between the four races: Human, Elf, Troll or Dwarf. Depending on which race you choose, the character has access to different kinds of talents. The Trolls for example have more health than any of the other races and can in addition increase their armor for a short period of time. \n\nFor every enemy killed or flag/artifact retrieved, money is awarded to invest into weapons and spells at the beginning of the round. Only up to three weapons can be used in one round. Grenades also eat up an entire slot. Next to weapons, players can also purchase magic or tech. This includes invulnerability, teleportation, attacks spells, a radiating healing tree and resurrection for magic, and the ability to see through walls, gliders, enhanced physical attributes, increased accuracy, anti-magic generators for tech.\n\n<i>Shadowrun</i> is the first game to feature cross-platform gaming between Windows and the Xbox 360 through the Live service both platforms. If you own a Gold membership for Windows Live (a free month is included in the box) you can play with or against owners of the Xbox360 version and vice versa. To even the odds, the Windows' players aiming reticule is distorted during quick turns and extra stability is given. To counter the pixel-accuracy of Windows players, the Xbox 360 owners are given aim assistance.",

All battles take place at separate screens, and it is not possible to move on the battle field. The main game combat element is that each member of the party has their own shadow monster.

      "description": "<i>Armored Core 4</i> is the 12th installment in the Armored Core series. The games are set in an alternate universe where corporations fights wars and have taken over governmental control.  Due to the growth of the population, food and energy became scarce and widened the gap between the rich and the poor. Anarchy ensued and the government lost control of the situation. People turned to the corporations to provide for safety. Six corporations struggled for power and launched a full scale war, known as the Nation Dismantlement War. A new order was established and Pax Economica was introduced, a system where loyalty guaranteed food and safety.\n\nFive years after the establishment of the Pax Economica, the player takes the role of a member of the Ravens, a rebel group who wants to challenge the modern slavery by force. The player controls a giant Mech, part of a squad, which can be assembled with the available parts, and customized with weapons, paint and aesthetic options. On different locations all over the world, the player fights Mechs from the corporations in 30 missions grouped together in chapters. At the end of each level, new parts become available and the Mech can be repaired with the wages. Multiplayer is supported over the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live.",

      "description": "<em>WarTech: Senko no Ronde</em> is an action game which resembles a mix of a arcade style shooter and a projectile-based fighting game like Psychic Force or Virtual On. Played from a top down point of view, two players (or one player against the computer) pilot a mech in an arena with the goal of destroying the other player. Each fighter has available a variety of attacks and defenses, including a main attack, a secondary attack, the B.O.S.S. attack, and defense barriers. The main attack also has several variations which can be utilized by firing and dashing or firing and blocking at the same time.\n\nThe B.O.S.S. mode attacks require the use of energy on the charge gauge; when activated your mech becomes much larger and can execute several powerful attacks (this resembles the end of level bosses seen in many shooters). When in B.O.S.S. mode the gauge will rapidly deplete and when gone your fighter returns to the normal configuration. The higher the charge gauge level when B.O.S.S. mode is activated the longer you will be able to remain in that mode.\n\nEach mech also has available an anti-field defense available when defending from a B.O.S.S. attack; this also uses up energy on the charge gauge, but will destroy any bullets near your mech. When beginning the game you can select from a number of different characters, each with different abilities affecting the speed, firepower, and defense characteristics of the mech. Several game play modes are available, including a story mode, score mode, and multiplayer modes.",

      "description": "Based on the 2007 movie, <i>Transformers: The Game</i> puts players in the role of either the Autobot or Decepticon factions in an attempt to find the AllSpark, the artifact which gave life to their race. The Autobots intend to protect it for good, while the Decepticons desire its power for evil. The two factions fought their battle on the planet Cybertron, but in an ultimate attempt to protect it, the Autobots hurled the AllSpark into space where it remained hidden on Earth. When the Decepticons discover the location, they want to finish the war on Earth.\n\nSet in a 3D sandbox environment with possibilities to interact and destroy the environment, players can choose between the two teams, each with different story-based goals. These are set on different locations, with primary and secondary quests. The storyline for the heroic Autobots follows the plot and events of the original movie. The storyline for the villainous Decepticons, however, allows the robots to destroy both the planet and more aggressively bring an end to their foes. Players can choose characters such as Optimus Prime or Bumblebee from the list of selectable Autobots, or Megatron and Starscream from the Decepticons.\n\nShown from a third-person perspective, the robots can switch between a robot and a vehicle/aircraft form, jump, block, dive underground, roll, dodge, use various weapons, and climb buildings. Special actions can be unlocked through the skill tracker. By performing long slides or jumps, symbols in the tracker will light up and provide extras.\n\nAlong the way, various collectibles can be found, ranging from promo images and artwork, to playable versions of the original \"Generation 1\" characters. The general gameplay is identical across the different platforms, but certain features are tied to specific versions.",

      "description": "Not even a day has fully passed since you rescued the US president from Mexican soil and you and the rest of your Ghost team are on the way home. Then the General phones in and gives you your next mission: a group of terrorists deposited two dirty bombs (normal blasting compositions combined with radioactive material) near the city of Juarez. Your goal as Captain Mitchell is to once again save the day with your three team mates.\n\nLike in its predecessor Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter you see Captain Mitchell from behind while you command your team mates directly over the Cross-Com to fulfil your objectives like blowing up a bunch of anti-air-vehicles and then raiding a rebel outpost. To do so you have the normal Ghost team weaponry like the MR-C to your disposal which you can equip you and your team with before and at some points even during the missions. You also have access to a tactical map which allows you to see an aerial view of the current level.\n\nThe four multiplayer modes from the previous game are back: Co-op Campaign, Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, and Hamburger Hill in which a team needs to hold a central zone of the map for a certain amount of time.\n\nThe PC version of the game was independently developed from the Xbox 360 version and is, besides the storyline, almost completely different and much more tactic-oriented. The 360 version is played from a third-person perspective and has a fewer multiplayer maps (and game modes). With the more action-based approach, there are no individual orders and a limited amount of team order (4 compared to 8 in the PC version). Players also cannot pick up enemy weapon or use stationary turrets. The game's planning phase is entirely linear, while in the PC version players can plan dynamic insertion points. There are less classes and the tactical map is limited, using wire-frame instead of a full 3D map.\n\nCompared to the 360 version, the PS3 game supports the SIXAXIS control, and adds extra multiplayer maps, 8 new weapons in quick mission mode, and two new co-operative multiplayer modes.",

      "description": "<i>Wing Commander Arena</i> is an Xbox Live arcade game based off the Wing Commander space combat franchise. The game is set in 2701 and the player is sent to the Frontier to destroy the remains of the Kilrathi Empire in decay. Unlike the other games in the series, Arena is much more action-oriented with a full focus on the dogfights in space, turning it into an arcade game.\n\nThere are 2 different game modes. In the multi-player mode up to 16 players can go free-for-all or play in teams. In one of the game modes, players can organize armadas to attack opposing capital ships. These ships are made up of 3 levels of defence. The player-controlled fighters need to defend their own main ship and attack the enemy capital ship at the same time. After breaking down one level of defence (usually consisting of missiles and turrets), a new level becomes visible, with the third being the bridge, after which the ship is blown up and the game is won. In another game type players defend their satellite in a capture-the-flag mode, or go one-on-one in duels. In the bearpit mode players can watch duels from the sidelines and play mini-games, or shoot at each other or inside the bearpit.\n\nIn the single-player mode, there are new ships to unlock through different modes: training levels, melee battles or missions where only asteroids need to be blown up. Players can choose from 18 ships (9 Terran Confederation and 9 Kilrathi), all of which are upgraded versions of ships appearing in earlier Wing Commander titles. Each race has 3 main ships: a light fighter (Arrow/Darket), a heavy fighter (Rapier/Dralthi) and a bomber (Broadsword/Paktahn), with different variations based on the upgrades changing the ships' design.\n\nUnlike the previous games, the first-person perspective has been traded for a 3rd-person view on a 2D plane, with the third axis only for special maneuvers such as barrel rolls, flips, immelman turns, 180 turns and devices and moves only available for specific ships. There are 8 game maps, leaderboards and achievements. During gameplay, players can collect power-ups that restore the shield or fill up missiles, provide additional damage (hammer shot/cheap shot), or rare items causing wingmen to appear, energy absorption or supershields.",

      "description": "In the year 1960 a plane crashes in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean with a man named Jack as the only survivor. He has the apparent luck of resurfacing in front of what looks like a door to an underwater complex. Without hesitating, Jack enters the door and is greeted by slogans that praise the city of Rapture, a paradise of free will built in the 1940's by a business magnate named Andrew Ryan. However, even before he assimilates all this new information, the descent to this supposed paradise ends and he can only see ruins and chaos. Learning about the destiny of Rapture will be now Jack's main motivation while he tries to survive the horrors that the free will can create.\n\n<i>BioShock</i> is a first-person shooter with gameplay elements and storytelling technique reminiscent of System Shock games. Rapture, the once proud social experiment inspired by the real-world objectivist philosophy of Ayn Rand, has been nearly destroyed, its inhabitants either dead or fallen victims to bizarre scientific experiments. The retro-futuristic setting incorporates elements of sci-fi with art deco and steampunk influences, featuring interior design and propaganda posters reminiscent of 1950's.\n\nThe game's plot is largely revealed through recorded messages left by Rapture's inhabitants before they were killed or mutated. Much of the plot development is therefore dedicated to reconstructing the events of the past, similarly to <i>System Shock</i> games. Limited usage of stealth, the possibility to hack security cameras and other devices, and character customization are the gameplay elements that further tie <i>BioShock</i> to its spiritual predecessors.\n\nIn its core, however, the game is more action-oriented, restricting the role-playing mechanics of <i>System Shock 2</i> to abilities and upgrades that can be acquired and equipped by the main character. Most of the enemies in the game are Splicers, the deformed and insane citizens of Rapture. The protagonist has an arsenal of firearms to combat them, but is also able to use plasmids, which act similarly to magic and deplete a special energy called EVE. Various types of plasmids may directly hurt enemies, sabotage their movements, or enhance the player character's defense. Combat tactics often rely on successive usage of different types of weapons and plasmids. For example, encasing an enemy in ice with a plasmid makes it possible to shatter it to pieces with a single shot; protecting himself with an electric shield, the protagonist can electrocute enemies and strike them with melee weapons, etc.\n\nThe player can only equip a limited number of active and passive plasmids, and also has an inventory limit for every type of item. Restoring and enhancing items can be found by exploring the environment or purchased from vending machines. These can also be hacked, similarly to turrets, cameras, safes, and other types of locks. Hacking is presented as a Pipe Mania-like mini-game.\n\nPlasmids, on the other hand, are mostly purchased by spending certain amounts of a mutagen known as ADAM. This mutagen can be obtained from mysterious creatures called \"Little Sisters\" - little girls that can be seen in most of the game's locations, accompanied and protected by very strong, genetically enhanced humans grafted to armored diving suits and nicknamed \"Big Daddies\". In order to capture a Little Sister the player normally has to defeat her Big Daddy. Afterwards, the player has the choice of killing the girl, harvesting large amounts of ADAM in process, or sparing her life. Depending on the player's moral decisions concerning the Little Sisters, the game's story will be concluded with different endings.\n\nThe Playstation 3 version adds a harder difficulty level called \"Survivor Mode\" to the game.",

      "description": "<em>Project Sylpheed</em> is an arcade-style shooter and is the follow-up to Silpheed: The Lost Planet on the PlayStation 2. The game's story takes place in the year 2632, five hundred years after humanity left the solar system. Under Earth's rule, 11 different star systems have now been terraformed and colonized. However, there are a number of groups who object to Earth's rule and desire independence; four of them have joined forces and formed a rebel group called the ADAN Freedom Alliance. The main characters in the story are Katana Faraway, Ellen Bernstein, and Margras Mason; all are young pilots having just joined the Earth's military, the Terra Central Armed Forces (TCAF). Following a suspicious accident, Margras joins the opposing ADAN forces to fight against his former friends and home planet.  You control Katana in the game, and as missions are completed the story progresses.\n\nWhile previous Silpheed games utilized a top down view of the action, <em>Project Sylpheed</em> features a fully 3-D view from either just behind your ship, or a first person view from within it. During the game you'll need to complete a series of missions; these are varied and include having to destroy all opponents in an area or defend an allied ship from attack. Initially there are fewer enemies and you don't have powerful weaponry, but as the game progresses the enemy increases in count and abilities and you can upgrade your ship with more powerful weapons. During a mission several sub-objectives may also become available which can be completed (some of the sub-objectives also unlock Xbox 360 Achievements when completed).",

      "description": "After they had fought out their civil war on their homeworld called Stroggos, the Strogg ventured out into space to conquer other planets and study other races to integrate them into their own. In 2060 they enter space above their next target: Earth. The Global Defense Force (GDF) is completely overwhelmed by the attack of this highly advanced force but they don't give up and fight for their survival. Ultimately Earth will fall into the hands of the Strogg and the events which lead to the beginning of Quake II will unfold but until then, you'll be an important part of this last battle for control over the planet!\n\nAs a successor of Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory focuses on objective driven gameplay rather than just capturing flags like you do in the Battlefield Series. This means that on every map one team needs to fulfill an objective while the other needs to guard it. For example on the map \"Valley\" the GDF needs to build a bridge, then drive a MCP over the bridge to a nearby outpost, hack a Strogg-shield so that the MCP can fire a missile into the Strogg base so that the GDF can enter it and destroy a generator.\n\nTo make it even more complex, most objectives need to be completed by a specific class. On each side are five classes and each class has special abilities. The engineer for example can build the bridge on Valley, repair damaged vehicles or deploy identities while the Field Ops supports his teammates by handing out weapons and deploying artillery systems. Since the maps are all pretty big, you also have access to several kinds of vehicles ranging from little quadbikes to helicopters.\n\nUnlike most multiplayer-games, the teams in <i>Enemy Territory: Quake Wars</i> don't just have a different skin but are actually completely asymmetrical balanced from classes over weapons to vehicles. This means that while both teams have a medic, they both function differently. The GDF medic for example behaves like every other medic by instant reviving his teammates but the Strogg technician needs a few seconds before his dead companion is alive again. To balance this out, the Strogg technician can turn dead GDF soldiers into spawn hosts. So if he dies, he respawns at such a host (if it hasn't been destroyed).",

      "description": "<i>Halo 3</i> is the third game in the main Halo series.  Like the rest of the series, it is a sci-fi/military-themed first-person shooter with an emphasis on vehicles and an extensive multiplayer mode in addition to the single-player campaign.\n\nAs before, the series' signature shield system is used where, rather than health, you have a force field of sorts which loses power as you are attacked.  You needn't pick up anything to refill it, only take cover for several seconds.  If you can avoid being attacked, the shield will recharge on its own.\n\nVehicles are again present.  These are human and alien transport which can be driven or ridden in with another player or AI doing the driving.  Halo 3 adds numerous new types of vehicles, notably a massive mobile command center called the Elephant and a human VTOL aircraft called the Hornet.  Enemies with good timing can board a vehicle, kicking out the occupant.\n\nAlso as before, you are limited to one weapon in hand (or one in each hand for some of the smaller guns) and one on back-up with both human and alien weapons available.  Weapons can be fired or used to club someone for a melee hit.  There are several new weapons, including the gravity hammer, which is a massive hammer for one-hit kills in close combat.  When using a single weapon, your second trigger throws grenades, which have a new spike type in addition to the basic sticky and frag ones from previous games.  Turrets are back, which are mounted guns with a new missile pod variant and the added ability to rip them off their moorings and carry them around in 3rd person view.\n\nThere is a new feature called equipment where you get objects with particular effects, such as a gravity lift, a shield drain field, a shield recharge field, land mines and a bubble shield which can be penetrated by players, but not gunfire.  One piece of equipment can be carried at a time and it can be deployed anywhere.\n\nAll the multiplayer game types from Halo 2 are back.  This includes the standard fps games like slayer (essentially deathmatch), capture the flag, assault (reverse ctf), territories and king of the hill (territories with a single point).  There are also Halo-specific games, like oddball, where you must hold an object the longest time and juggernaut, where one player gets specials powers.  Only they can score points.  If you kill that player, you become the juggernaut.  Two new games are added: VIP, where you are tasked with killing a specific player on the other team and must protect your own VIP, and infection, which is a human team vs a zombie team and humans are infected and brought to the other team as they are killed.  There are also dozens of variants of these, such as crazy king, which is king of the hill with a moving hill, mad dash which is a juggernaut games where the object is to get to waypoint instead of kill people and single-weapon versions of slayer.  You can make your own custom game types by manipulating a a number of variables such as weapons, goals and player stats.\n\nThis is augmented by Forge, which is a map editor.  While it doesn't have the ability to change level geometry, Forge can be used to completely change object placements.  This is not only weapons and vehicles and power-ups, but spawn points, crates, fusions coils (exploding barrels), etc.  The map editor is actually a playable game mode with some players becoming the monitor and placing objects for use by their teammates.  They can give give them a tank, for instance, or create a barrier and levitate it along as mobile cover.\n\nThe campaign mode contains a number of new features as well.  The players now control distinct characters in co-op rather than the Chief just having an identical twin, the player limit has been expanded to four and it is now playable online.  There is a metagame where you score points in the campaign (used for some of the achievements) and the skulls from <i>Halo 2</i> have been expanded with a checklist and additional features, such as unlocking extra armor for use in multiplayer and additional dialogue featured throughout the game.\n\nThe ability to customize your appearance has been expanded from <i>Halo 2</i> with not only a longer list of emblems to place on your armor and the ability to pick a third color, but multiple armor variants which can be mixed and matched and the ability to use a female voice.\n\nOther new features include a theater where you can re-watch games you or others played from the viewpoint of any player-character or in third-person or with a free camera.  You have the ability to save films for posterity, take screenshots or edit films for highlight reels or machinima (multiplayer only).  This is a multiplayer feature, so you can watch films with people in your online party.\n\nAll of these things (edited maps, custom games, films and screenshots) can be put in a new file-sharing feature and are accessible to other players or through any PC via the internet.",

City-states use the planet as a training ground for their armed forces - and this is where your story begins. As a gladiator in a Mech arena, you must prove your worth to yourself - and to others.\n\nSimilar to Starsiege: Tribes focus on teamwork, players can guide and customize heavily armed mechs across 100 single-player levels in Story Mode, or set up quick offline death matches against bots. They can also take the fight online with a LAN multi-player combat and play classic Capture the Flag and Deathmatch modes along with an all new mode, Bomb Run.",

      "description": "In this action-adventure powered by the Unreal Engine 3, you play as a robot named Blitz whose space station has come under attack from the dreaded megaNOED. You will have to travel to six non-linear different areas of the station (from the armory to the radar station to the cooling towers) each with three levels in order to power up the massive Space Cannon and vanquish the invaders.  A final level will appear once these are all complete.  \n\nAlong the way, you must dispatch many different enemies including arm-twirling nuisance bots, flying wheels of death and even smiling, spherical miniNOEDs. There's both ground and air-based robots plus a series of boss battles at the end of every hub. While most enemies can be shot and destroyed, there are others where you must use the environment around them as well as physics-based gameplay (powered by Ageia's PhysX) to outsmart them like using barrels to crush enemies or lure them into dangerous areas.  You'll discover a friend in the station's depths who will provide you with an assortment of new upgrades. Some can be bought by collecting green cards called Upgradium throughout the levels. Others will be given to you if they are essential to completing an area. \n\nYou start out with basic rocket launchers and energy guns, but later you'll acquire a hovergun that will cause whatever it hits to float up in the air, and a point-to-point gun which binds two separate objects together with an energy beam. There are puzzles throughout which need to be solved in order to power up the cannon, some as easy as the \"push button\" variety while others involve switching the laser paths with prisms to open doors or putting metal objects in a shredder to make a shell for the cannon. Some can have multiple solutions depending on your own inventiveness.\n\nThe Xbox Live version of the game uses Allegorithmic's ProFX procedural texturing tool in order to reduce the game size small enough for the service.  An earlier version of the game called RoboHordes was made as a tech demo in 2005 for the Intel dual core processor as a single-level game that featured entirely physics-driven game play.",

      "description": "The Bible tells us that God created Adam as an image of himself - that is not true. It is also not true that Adam was the first thinking being to walk upon the earth. In the beginning was the Firstborn. The Firstborn was a true image of God. Perfect to the core, a creature with no sex, neither dark nor light and both beautiful and terrible to behold. God feared his creation and left it unfinished, banishing it to the Abyss and created Adam instead with all his flaws.\n\nBut the Firstborn had already touched the Earth. Leaving behind a taint so powerful that even God's expulsion couldn't keep it from breaking through into the mortal world to reclaim it's birthright. In a remote desert in the Middle East the Earth was wounded. Eon after eon the Firstborn continued to fester, breaking down the fabric of reality as human civilisation flourished around it.\n\nAccording to an ancient prophecy the Firstborn will successfully break through into the mortal world seven times. Bringing with it diseases, corruption and perversity until seven mystics come and sacrifice themselves to drive it back into the abyss. This has already happened six times. Now once again the ground under the city called Al-Khali trembles as the Firstborn enters the world one last time to either be defeated in a last battle or find eternal freedom.\n\nDuring the centuries every civilisation made sure that those seven mystics would stand ready to defeat the Firstborn and this hasn't changed. Known as the Jericho Squad they are now called to Al-Kahli. The city in which one travels further back in time as he ventures deeper into its heart until he reaches the beginning of all.\n\nThe game is a pretty straight-forward First Person Shooter but every one of the seven members of the Jericho Squad has different abilities and uses different weapons. While Cpt. Devin Ross uses the Patrioteer (a combination of shotgun and assault rifle) and is besides Father Paul Rawlings the only member of the team that can heal wounded teammates, Sgt. Wilhelmina \"Billie\" Church is more of a samurai. She uses a Nodachi as a melee-weapon and a rapid-fire sub-machine gun in addition to Blood magic which allows her to summon either a Blood or a Fire Ward.\n\nAlthough your teammates do a pretty good job on their own, later on you have the ability to take over one of them and do whatever you want to do yourself. The squad is also divided into two teams which you can give the orders \"Hold\" or \"Follow\" which comes in handy if you position one team to cover your six and take the rest with you into the fight.\n\nThe health system is somewhat similar to games like Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Vegas or Call of Duty. This means that there are no health packs scattered around. When you're hit you have to search for cover to regenerate. If you are hurt badly enough you'll go to the ground but as mentioned Ross and Rawlings can bring you back to life. The game only ends if you can't be healed fast enough or both Ross and Rawlings are dead.\n\nAs the name suggests, Clive Barker, the maker of the Hellraiser movies, had great influence in the making of the whole game including art-direction and background story but <i>Clive Barker's Jericho</i> is not the successor to Clive Barker's Undying.",

These can be shot down by the ship's gun (which has unlimited ammo) or eliminated by activating one of the player's limited supply of \"smart bombs\", which will clear the screen of all current enemies.\n\nThe physics of the game were quite unusual for the time; the ship does not simply follow the mouse's movement like a mouse cursor. Rather, it retains its inertia, and must be carefully guided around so it does not crash into anything. Bullets, when fired, travel in the direction of the ship's movement, requiring the player to actually travel toward enemies in order to shoot them down.\n\nThis was the first color game for the Macintosh, although it was business-as-usual for the IIgs.",

      "description": "<i>Space Giraffe</i> is a fast-paced arcade shooter, created by Ivan Zorzin and Jeff Minter, and built on the Neon Xbox 360 light synthesizer visualisation Minter wrote for the Xbox 360 frontend. Gameplay is similar to the classic Tempest. The player controls a Space Giraffe on the outer rim of a 3D extruded surface. It can be moved around the rim and needs to destroy the enemies that approach from the other side of the surface. Shots fired by enemies either needed to be avoided or can be pushed back by targeting them.\n\nA line on the surface acts as a zone, extending or contracting based on the player's performance. While in the zone, the Space Giraffe can collide with enemies, knock them off the rim and fire additional, guidable shots. Bullets are also slowed down there. Power-ups are called pods. Up to five can be stored and they allow the Space Giraffe to jump, filling the entire power zone. When more than 5 pods are kept, the additional ones provide bonuses such as extra lives, faster bullets, a bonus round or bonus points.\n\nThe visuals consists of bright and psychedelic shapes. The different enemies have different attack patterns and include Grunts, Flowers, Boffins, Feedback Monsters, Rotors, Containers and Zappers. There are more than 100 levels in the game and players can play custom music synchronizing with the visuals.\n\nThe windows version was updated with a new shader library, used to create a NUXX mix of the graphic design of the levels. It also contains the Acid mix of the original XBLA levels.",

      "description": "In the nearby future scientists develop a so-called Quantum suit that allows the carrier to travel through time. Two prototypes called Alpha and Betasuit are ready for testing when Aiden Krone enters the lab, steals the Alphasuit and makes a time-jump before he blows up the building. Luckily you were there and had the chance to jump into the Betasuit and activate the time travel before the building was destroyed. But it took the suit a second too long to jump so the explosion hit it and your jump didn't go as planned. When you wake up in an alley in the future you quickly realize that Krone has already declared himself leader of the world and transformed it into a totalitarian state with him as the dictator. Shortly after waking up, you are found by some rebels and you join their task in order to stop Krone and fix the timeline since your suit was too badly damaged by the blast.\n\nFight your way through hordes of enemies with futuristic, but also conventional weapons like pistols or shotguns. Your suit isn't rendered totally useless. It still allows you to slow down, rewind and forward time for a short period. This not only allows you to overcome obstacles like fire but you can also trick your enemies. Players can slow down the time and then steal the weapon out of the hand of an enemy - if he hasn't a too strong grip on it. This feature is also used for small time-related puzzles. \n\nThere are notable differences with the time manipulation element from the Prince of Persia series. Manipulating the time won't affect yourself and when you are too badly wounded and die, you can't just rewind. You remain dead and have to reload. The game also doesn't feature medipacks. Instead the hero just needs to rest for a second if he is wounded and will then be fully healed again.\n\nManipulating time is also part of the multiplayer-experience. Besides the normal game-modes Deathmatch, Team-Deathmatch, One-on-One and Capture the flag, the game also features King of Time and Meltdown Madness.\n\nIn King of Time there's a Time Sphere in the center of the map which makes you impervious to all time effects. To win the game you need to rack up kills while you have the item. Meltdown Madness instead requires of you to throw Chrono Grenades at the opposing team's machine to prevent it from functioning. Once a machine of a team has completed his countdown, that team wins.\n\nThe Chrono Grenades are also part of all the other game modes in addition to the Time Shield and the Time Resistance power-up. While the Chrono Grenades come in the three flavors and slow down, forward or rewind time in the area of the blast. The Time Shield not only makes you immune to time manipulation but also slows down every foreign object in a specific area which is good for dodging enemy fire. The Time Resistance power-up grants immunity against all time effects for a short period of time.",

      "description": "<i>Crysis</i>, the first game of a planned trilogy, is a first-person shooter set in the year 2019 and the spiritual successor to Far Cry. The player takes on the role of the US soldier Jake Dunn. On a remote Pacific island a meteor has been excavated and the North Korean army quickly moved in to secure the location. After they capture a team of US archaeologists the US Army sends in a Delta Force team to investigate and free the scientists. Most of the missions are played along, but often with a AI squad that also star in the cutscenes and play a crucial part in the story.\n\nDuring the battles with the North Korean soldiers it becomes apparent that there is an even greater threat. When the meteor opens up a huge alien ship is revealed that starts to xenoform the island by freezing it over. The Americans and North Koreans are forced to join forces when alien machines emerge from the vessel and attack both sides. Now both sides have to stop the xenoforming process together.\n\n<i>Crysis</i> offers a singleplayer campaign as well as an objective based multiplayer for up to 32 players. One of the main innovations of the game is the so called Nanosuit. This high tech combat suit allows the player to increase his speed, strength or speed for short amounts of time. Jake Dunn and his fellow soldiers can get into a cloaking mode, become invisible and it restores health when powered up.\n\nIn the single player campaign the player will encounter several enemy types. A large part is spent fighting North-Korean soldiers. Aliens are first encountered in a Zero-G environment once the meteorite has been breached. When leaving the meteorite the actual alien invasion begins and the player then mainly faces small alien scouts and the larger alien hunters.\n\nDuring the campaign there are a number of more or less typical shooter weapons to be gathered, such as machineguns, a shotgun, a missile launcher, a sniper rifle, explosives, various types of grenades and a gauss gun. In the later weapons there are also some alien weapons which can freeze opponents. Not all weapons can be held at once, they can be swapped for the ones from the bodies of dead soldiers and most of the weapons have a limited amount of ammo. There is also an extensive weapons upgrade feature which is available from the start and allows the player to reconfigure weapon configurations on the fly. Tactical or explosive ammunition can be added, or a flashlight, a laserscope, a silencer, grenades and more. Most of the weapons have multiple firing options, from single bullets to rapid bursts.\n\nAlmost any vehicle can be driven, from jeeps to large vans, regular cars, tanks and patrol boats. Most of these have mounted weapons. Other equipment includes binoculars, nightvision, a radar with targets in the bottom left corner of the screen and a direct voice connection with other squad members.\n\nJust like Crytek's previous game <i>Far Cry</i>, it comes with a sandbox editor to create new levels. The console versions do not have the expansions and do not support multiplayer.",
