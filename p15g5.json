The NHL license ensures that real teams and players of the era are included, with a full league and playoff system. Many game options can be toggled - the infamous fighting is optional, as are the penalties and offsides. The control system makes it possible to execute one-touch passes, and several special trick moves to quickly advance the ball. As a bonus feature, it included Hockey Card profiles of every player on CD and interviews with the stars of the game.",

The in-game presentation follows a TV-style script, zooming in players while displaying stats during clock stoppages.\n\nAs far as game modes go, in the year of the first Olympic Tournament with professional players, NHL 98 introduced the first real international competition, with 18 International teams to choose from. Other game modes include Season (option to pick between 25 or 82 games) and Playoff (best of 1, 3, 5 or 7 matches) and a Penalty Shootout mode.",

      "description": "The game that started the best-selling series licensed by football's world governing body, this first installment in the long running series used a dimetric (colloquially known as \"isometric\") viewpoint, previously unusual in football games but quickly imitated by several titles. The televisual presentation, one of the unique points of the early EA Sports titles, with hosts introducing the matches, was another thing making the game stand out from a market dominated by <i>Sensible Soccer</i> and <i>Kick Off</i> games.\n\nBased on international teams (with fictional player names), their abilities in each skill area rated out of 10 to give the player an overall impression of how good they are. The options available follow the standard set: fouls and offsides can be toggled on and off, the match length can be set, and if the timer operates  continuously, or only while the ball is in play. Gameplay privileges quick runs, short passes and blistering shots outside the penalty box, and set pieces are controlled by moving a box into the target area for the ball, and then passed, lobbed or kicked directly. On the tactical side, formations can be selected, with 5 different strategies also available (although not all of these combinations make sense) as can the team Coverage - the areas which defenders, midfielders and strikers cover.",

The game now features full tournament modes (although the players on the teams are fictitious) and four different pitches (including an implementation of plastic pitches, whose uneven bounce cause controversy when several British clubs tried them in the 1980s).\r\n\r\nViewed top-down, the controls involve trapping the ball under your foot, giving you time to prepare passes. Running with the ball is tricky at first, as it doesn't stick to your foot the way it did in contemporary football games. Complex moves such as overhead kicks, back-heels and long-range through-ball passes can be completed with practice.",

      "description": "This game lets you play two-on-two arcade basketball with players from all the NBA teams. Gameplay is fast and action-packed, with few rules, no fouls, and deliberately unrealistic jamming. Players are rated on eight ability categories, from steals and blocks, to dunks and 3-pointers.\n\nUp to four human players can take part, each always controlling a single player for their team, and AI for missing players. This allows for four players to face each other in teams of two, or for two players to team up against a third player with a CPU team-mate.\n\nThe <i>Tournament Edition</i> ups each team's roster to three players, and allows for substitutions between quarters. Shoving players now results in injuries, which lower a player's stats; encouraging you to sub them out and let them recover. Aside from the usual secret characters and cheat modes, the T.E. also includes four new additions you can individually enable from the special options menu:\n<ul><li>\"Hot Spots\" are randomized zones on the court that reward extra points (up to a 9-point shot!) for making a basket while standing within them.\n\n<li>Powerup icons appear randomly, and convey temporary arcade-like benefits when picked up. Some examples are instant \"on-fire,\" enhanced 3-point accuracy, monster dunks from anywhere on the court, or a bomb that knocks all other players to the ground.\n\n<li>\"Juice Mode\" increases the speed of the game up to 4x.\n\n<li>\"Tournament Mode\" disables all other modes, special characters, and cheats, and challenges you to defeat all the NBA teams to unlock extra players (2 extra players for almost every team). Winning Tournament Mode also unlocks a higher CPU difficulty level.</li></ul>",

Each match is divided into a series of rounds, much like a fighting game. Instead of each round ending in a KO, it simply ends when the player forces the other wrestler(s) to fall by reducing their energy meter. Game modes include single player arcade mode, tournament mode, and versus mode for one-on-one multiplayer.",

There is a large number of moves to perform, including turnbuckle maneuvers and \"illegal\" acts such as hitting the opponent with a metal folding chair.\n\nThis game supports up to four simultaneous players, and has the following modes: One-on-One, Tag Team, Bedlam, Survivor Series, Royal Rumble, Raw Endurance Match, and Rematch.

      "description": "In this isometric football game, 51 national teams are represented to play in two game modes: Exhibition and Tournament (a series of seven games on four continents, with a final against the World All-Stars), with the ability to set time, difficulty level, see cutscenes after goals and if players are free to kick each other around without (many) fouls.\n\nWhile the game seems short-featured for 1995 standards, the tournament mode includes a twist: depending on how well the player defeats his opponents, he can trade his \"standard players\", who won't do anything spectacular (but at least fill up the ranks) for star players, who not only look different, are able to cross and backheel the ball but also have a unique ability at the disposal of the player:<ul>\n<li><b>The Marker:</b> can latch on an opposing player, stopping him from running away with the ball;</li><br>\n<li><b>Goalkeeper 1:</b> more capable of stopping shots than the regular goalkeeper;</li><br>\n<li><b>Barger:</b> this large, muscular player is able to shove everyone in his path;</li><br>\n<li><b>Tricky:</b> capable of jumping (or bunny-hopping, to be more precise) with the ball tucked between his feet, avoiding tackles;</li><br>\n<li><b>The Cheat:</b> while it's hard to talk about fair play in a game where kicking a defenders' leg to gain a corner is (mostly) a legitimate play, this player takes the whole thing into the next level, being able to dig fouls out of nowhere, at the expense of the ball (if he's carrying it or the referee waves play on) or just some stains in his shirt (if he's trying to pull an offensive foul), with the odds of 50/50 (25% for penalties);</li><br>\n<li><b>Passer:</b> capable of feeding forwards with laser-precision passes; </li><br>\n<li><b>Striker 1:</b> capable of unleashing impossibly-sliced shots, scoring from virtually any position in the offensive area;</li><br>\n<li><b>Striker 2:</b> best used from positions directly in front of goal, this striker features a shot that is so powerful the ball ignites as it approaches the goal;</li><br>\n<li><b>Goalkeeper 2:</b> features a better chance of stopping special shots from both Strikers;</li><br></ul>In Exhibition games teams start with their own setup of start players, from none to a full team. The playing surface also affects gameplay - playing in wet grass removes all ball bounce, the opposite occurring with sand, and the most dramatic change, a rocky field where the ball can change direction after hitting the ground, turning throw-ins into corners, poor attempts on goals and vice-versa.",

      "description": "<i>WWF Super WrestleMania</i> is a wrestling game that uses rules and wrestlers from the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). The game introduces a characteristic \"tug of war\" gameplay style, which involves two wrestlers grappling each other until one of them has the upper hand. The player has to repeatedly tap a button to execute this move. All the wrestlers share the same set of typical WWF moves such as scoop slams, suplexes, hip tosses, dropkicks, clotheslines, and elbow drops. The Genesis (MegaDrive) version adds signature moves unique to each characters.\n\nThe game's modes are one-on-one, tag team, and Survivor Series matches (four-on-four). The Genesis version also has a WWF Championship mode, which allows the player to select one wrestler and slowly move his way up by defeating other wrestlers in a tournament consisting of one-on-one matches. \n\n",

This game saw Pond and friends competing in the underwater Olympics.\n\nThe events take the form of various mini-games, usually in the same vein as Hyper Sports, but with an aquatic theme and the humour seen in the <i>James Pond series</i> (e.g. The 100 Metre Splash). More unusual mini-games include Kipper Watching, which involves 'heading' incoming beach balls away from a troop of sleeping seals, and Gymnastics. Events can be played with up to 4 players.",

For an additional challenge, players can also choose to control the goalkeeper manually. A popular feature in previous editions, fighting is completely removed from the game. Game modes include exhibition games (or \"regular season\" in-game), playoffs (best of one or best of seven) and an all new shoot-out mode. The main options remain basically the same couple since the establishment of the series - period length (5, 10 or 20 minutes), line changes (off, manual or the new automatic mode) and penalties (off, on, on but no offsides). \n\nWhile there are some minor differences between platforms (Genesis  features record keeping for users and the MegaCD version has more stat screens, CD quality audio backdrops and the usual highlight clips here and there), only the PC version released at the same time features complete season action.",

      "description": "Endorsed by famous tennis player, Jimmy Connors, this game offers tournament and single play on multiple court types.\r\n\r\nUsing crosshairs, aim your ball to the other side of the court and hope you hit where you want.  If you are lucky, you might even score an Ace.  If not, you will need to be ready to return your opponent's return.  Run back and forth as you try to keep hitting the ball over the net until your opponent misses, or you do.  When you hit the ball, you will want to attempt changing the direction and speed of the ball to throw your opponent off balance.  This is the real challenge of any tennis game.",

After his adventures in Dream Land Kirby himself becomes the ball, and you must guide him around each hole using the sort of bar system that you see in most golf games. Where this game differs, however, is in the fact that you need to eliminate all on-screen enemies before you can guide Kirby into the hole and complete it. As per usual in golf games, the more strokes it takes you to complete the whole, the lower your score - so make sure you aim Kirby just right!\n\nYou'll find eight courses and a total of sixty-four holes in the game, not including the final showdown with King Dedede, as well as an action-packed two-player mode.",

      "description": "European Tour is best thought of as a remake of the original game, rather than a sequel as such. It features 5 courses from across Europe, and 60 top European pros, rather than the US-leaned lineup of the original. The graphics are much more detailed and colorful, as you'd expect considering the intervening years of advances in programming skill.\r\n\r\nThe control system is the standard three-click method used in most golf games, but you can now define intended draw/fade levels in advance of playing the shot, so that a perfect aim leads to a measured effect, and an imperfect one exaggerating the effect.\r\n\r\nAs well as the Stroke Play games of the original (where you count the total score across the whole round of 18 holes, and compare this to your opponent), there are also Match Play (where the aim is to win as many individual holes as possible) and Skins (the same, but with money) modes as well.",

The game is viewed from above and played up and down the pitch, without the left-to-right option of Goal. Matches can be between 2 or 20 minutes, and the scanner which shows player positions on the rest of the pitch can be moved, resized or disabled. The method of triggering aftertouch onto a pass can be chosen as well.\r\n\r\nThe game features a variety of tournaments, including the full World Cup and its qualifying rounds, and the European Championships, or individual matches, as well as being able to configure a league or cup tournament ot your own specification. Only international teams are included, although their names can be customised. Unlike most soccer games of the time, player ethnicities are accurately depicted.",

The game scrolls horizontally at a slight angle, and recreates the coin-op's close-up zoom effect after a player scores. Only a small area of the pitch is on screen at a time, but there is a scanner to show the whole pitch.\n\nAlthough the game has a referee, he often loses attention, and these moments give you a chance to foul, punch or side-swipe opposition players. One and two player options are included.",

Baseball designed by the Super Baseball Association has been very popular and is the best sport.\r\n\r\nHowever, the truth is that the association has used a colossal sum of money to promote Super Baseball as show business. They have manipulated each player's ability using the control computer to secretly decide victory or defeat in every game. The players who knew this removed the connecting parts of the computer to play their own game of baseball. Finally, a fair game is going to be played at Cyber Egg Stadium.\r\n\r\nIn <i>2020 Super Baseball</i> is a fast-paced game with new rules, where you can select 1 of 12 individual men, women, or robot players. During play, you can make your team stronger with prizes earned from amazing catches.\r\n",

After each stage completed (and some luck), a bonus stage will appear, as well as the chance to earn extra balls. You will only need a good target in the parquet block!\n\nBasic version differences:<ul>\n<li>The original Arcade version is a pool game where the player competes against the timer trying to get all balls in pockets and earn points.</li>\n<li>The later NES release introduces modes for 2 players with two variants: 2P Pocket Game (the traditional mode) and 2P 9-Ball Game, where the premise is to sink 9 balls before the other player makes them first, training mode and single-player Pocket game. In 1P Pocket game the player needs to clear four levels with alternating ball layouts (i.e. reaching a predetermined number of points by sinking consecutive shots and sinking balls in numerical order), starting from City class and all the way to the World Class. Starting from State class, the player needs to perform a special trick after beating a level, and if they fail, the level restarts with a different ball layout. </li>\n<li>Game Boy version is a completely redrawn game featuring 1 or 2 players actions with two game modes: 9-ball and Pocket. The Pocket mode is generally similar to NES version.</li>\n<li>Genesis and SNES versions feature improved graphics and sound. Pocket game mode is reworked to include more stages and trick shot layouts. Also in this mode the player travels to different cities in the U.S.A. and claims championship there. New modes are Trick game and Jukebox. Game Gear version of <i>Side Pocket</i> is basically a toned-down Genesis version.</li>\n<li><i>Side Pocket</i> for Wonder Swan features one and two-player play on a single device. In the single-player mode the player chooses an avatar from a menu and needs to beat the remaining opponents. The player and CPU then take turns in hitting the ball.\n </li>",

It has a US setting in terms of the courses and players, unlike PGA European Tour, with 8 licensed courses in total: Avenel, Las Colinas, River Highlands, Sawgrass, Scottsdale, Southwind, Summerlin and The Woodlands. Gameplay modes include three different practice options (driving range, putting green, and a full round) as well as a tournament, skins challenge, match play, and shoot-out.\n\nGameplay follows the standard model with swings made from of a view behind the golfer, with the customary three-click method (start, power, accuracy). Before taking a shot, the club choice, direction and intended draw/fade (spin on the ball) are selected. The game features instant replays and user-created players, stats and tournaments saved to battery-backed RAM. Only the Genesis version has course flybys with tips from PGA pros and switches to a different camera view for the ball's landing.",

      "description": "Olympic Summer Games is the 16-bit official videogame of the 1996 Olympic Games held in Atlanta, the third and the last IOC official title to be released on the console. A typical button masher, includes 10 events (100m sprint, 110m hurdles, pole vault, long jump, triple jump, javelin, high jump, discus, skeet and archery) and 32 countries around the world compete in custom or full Olympics, or just practice. Two players can compete head to head in the sprinting events, and a total of eight can play in the same game. Three difficulty levels allow competitive events for both rookies to veterans in the genre.\r\n\r\nSprinting events are a short and straight button mashing frenzy. 4 athletes compete simultaneously, the first winner advancing to the next round (two qualifiers and then the medal run). Only fast fingers and quick shotgun reaction can earn world record times. \r\n\r\nJumping events are a mix of shorter button mashing bursts combined with timely pressed jumps. From the straight forward high and long jump events (run and then set the jump angle) to the more elaborate triple jump (as the name suggests, three jumps must be carefully measured for world class results) and the complex pole vault, where a strong run must be followed by a sharp pole fixation and good a release upwards. Both long jump and triple jump have a first round composed by three jumps, the better eight progress into the second round, where they are given three more jumps. In the high jump and pole vault the competition continues until all athletes miss three consecutive jumps.\r\n\r\nThe throwing events (discus and javelin) work in the same fashion as the jumping events, although trickier to pull, as the setting of the angle must be followed by a timely release. Each player is entitled to three throws, the top eight allowed three more attempts.\r\n\r\nFinally, the shooting events. Archery is a three-round competition where the goal is to amass as many points as possible by shooting at the inner rings of the target. With six arrows per round, each shot must be calculated according to the wind, choosing between steady aim and lower tension (must be aimed upwards and compensating the wind) or higher tension but a jumpy aim (can be aimed directly at the \"gold\" points). Skeet is a five round competition where the goal is to hit five clay pigeons before they disappear off-screen with two slugs for each. ",

Game modes include friendlies, Domestic League and Cup  (composed by eight English teams), European League (16 European teams) and International cup (eight team tournament). Training allows to practice free kicks, penalties or to pass, shoot and dribble without opposition. \nPlayers can compete head to head, or play cooperatively against the computer in the same team. Other game options include player speed, wind and grass cut, along the typical half length, offside rules, extra time and difficulty setting. All changes, from team edits to options, are stored in the cartridge internal memory.\n\nAbout the game itself, it was one of the most popular of the time, featuring a top-down view  with the ball not sticking to the players' feet being the most prominent gameplay feature.",

      "description": "The Looney Tunes work hard at Warner Bros. studios acting in cartoons for all to enjoy. It's tough work, and afterwards they just want to relax and maybe shoot a few hoops in the parking lot. Of course they can't entirely leave their wild antics inside the studio, and will certainly bring some kind of zany onto the basketball court.\n\nLooney Tunes B-Ball is a 2-on-2 Basketball game, similar to the more well known NBA Jam. However, Looney Tunes is much more informal and silly, though this level of silliness is set by the player via the Wackiness Meter on the main menu. Players choose their teams from the likes of: Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd, Wile E. Coyote, Tasmanian Devil, Sylvester, Yosemite Sam and Marvin Martian. Each player has unique statistics for their shooting, 3-pointers, defense, stamina and speed.\n\nOnce on the court, the player can pass the ball, shoot the ball, grab a burst of speed or unleash a special defensive ability or a special offensive ability.. These abilities include cream pies, time bombs, sticks of dynamite and other fun toys from the ACME Corporation. Offensive Abilities must be \"bought\" by collecting gems and other items which occasionally show up on the basketball court.",

      "description": "In this final appearance of Fire Pro series on 16-bit consoles, the usual roster of over 150 wrestlers from several wresting promotions worldwide including several styles from Shoot or Pancrase to American and Lucha are joined by 80 Create-a-wrestler slots, plus secret wrestlers such as legends Gotch or Thesz or the roster of Blazing Tornado. While all fighters have fictional names, a lot of them are perfectly recognizable by their attire, stance and style. The CAW mode allows the player to create a wrestler from scratch, setting how they look (choosing face, size, clothing and setting colours) and fight, with several styles and stances available, as well as over 500 moves, each more suitable for certain styles and skills. To make them fight more realistically when controlled by the AI, the CAW mode also allows one to set move priorities.\n\nFive game modes are available, including World Championship (single and tag), Battle Royale, 5-man Elimination Mode, League Battle and the One Night Dream Match. There are several referees available (each with their own quirks) and variant rules, from allowing fighting outside the ring without count-out (or disallowing it) to the disabling of disqualifications from illegal moves.",

It's also possible to fight in single matches, tournaments, Battle Royal and Elimination matches. The usual array of options in CAW is present, being possible to create 16 new Wrestlers.\n\nGameplay, as usual is the series, is dramatically different than in most western games. Each wrestler has a bunch of moves, ranked from weak to strong. While it's possible to connect any of them from open situations, while grappling only when the opponent is already beaten the most powerful moves can be successfully used. ",

The options are a strength test, knocking down cans and a hit-the clown game.  In the latter two, players can  aim balls with the d-pad, then throw with the action button.  Leading targets is required.  The strength test has a mater that goes up and down and Barbie must land her hit when the indicator is on the bell to ring it.\n\nIn Wyoming, Barbie goes camping.  First, she must assemble her tent.  This is essentially a jigsaw puzzle.  Next, she must jump from rock to rock to get to the other side of the park where she can go on a nature hike.  In the next segment, players aim a camera cursor at animals as Barbie walks along the path and hit the action button to take photos.  This requires good reaction time.\n\nThere's a ranch in Texas where Barbie can ride horses.  The horse runs on its own.  The player pushes the action button to make it jump.  There are numerous gates on the course and the player must time jumps correctly to clear them.  If they hit too many, they must start over.  There is also the option to play horseshoes.  The cursor moves about erratically and you must press the action button when it passes over the stake.\n\nIn Florida, Barbie can play volleyball against Midge.  This game allows both players to play simultaneously in two-player mode.  Barbie and Midge can move forward or backward on the court and hit action to set the ball.  First one to ten points wins.  There is also a diving segment where barbies must navigate an underwater maze to collect sunken treasure. It might remind some people of Barbie's Ocean Discovery.\n\nFinally, there is Barbie's home in California.  Ken has hidden presents around the house and Barbie must find them and identify them by shape.",

      "description": "A game endorsed by the American player who stunned the tennis world in the early 90s with his \"Image is everything\" looks, sporting long hair, earrings and colorful shirts, <i>Andre Agassi Tennis</i> includes eight players (male and female and as expected, only Agassi is a real player) rated according to movement speed and both accuracy and strength on serve, backhand and forehand.\n\nGameplay features all the usual moves: smashes, passing shots, volleys and all kinds of backhand and forehand plays, but unlike other games, precise positioning and timing are crucial to avoid hitting the ball outside the court, swinging the racket into thin air or more embarrassing, let the ball hit you on the head.\nThree courts are available: Grass, Clay and Indoor (Sega versions  add a fourth, Hard), but the differences between them are minimal. Game modes change according to the version, with the 16-bit versions including a \"Skins\" game, where each point is worth a sum of money based on the number of times the ball was hit.",

Gameplay is similar to other sport games in which you control the character that has the ball at the time (although a lead character always marks the formations and generally controls the team), and special moves can be executed to try and eliminate your opponents (such as homing throws and other esoteric moves). \n\nThis sequel also adds more comprehensive tournament mechanics, for instance your performance in each match allows you to buy power-ups and special moves to enhance your players, you can also create a custom team and manage them throughout the tournament by adding or removing members as you see fit (you can even try to lure players from opposing teams). You can also choose among a series of formations and AI profiles in case you play alone, although you can use a multi-tap to play with up to 4 players.\n\nAvailable game modes include Tournament, Vs and Mechabutsuke mode which is a variation on Vs that involves a free-roaming court and no outfielders.",

Two buttons are used to control the ball, one for normal actions and one for \"Hyper Plays\", special attacks that can only be learned and used in the Hyper League. How a player will block or attack depends on the ball's speed and the players position. Team members who aren't under the player's direct control will also act on their own by positioning themselves or preparing spikes. They will, however, not block spikes on their own but it is possible to let players not under direct control block spikes by pressing one of the action buttons at the right moment.",

As new commisioner of the League he throws away all the old rules and make the game plays more to his liking which means basketball is to be an extremely physical game.  The new League is only for those who aren't scare of contact and are tough enough to endure constant physical pain.  The new NBA is extreme enough for players to wear armor to protect themselves from the new style of basketball that include hitting, shoving, punching and tackling.  It's an all-new basketball game that plays like the style of extreme football.  This game is contact basketball to the max.  There are even  weapons on the court such as bombs and saw blades that make this game one of the most violent basketball games of all time.",

Depending on the mode, a team must be formed using either all of one type of robot, or a mixture of different types assigned to different positions on the field. In any case, each soccer team has 8 players on the field including the goalie. The goal of each team is to score on the net of the opposing team, earning points to win the game. The action follows the ball as it is tossed around the field from player to player. Once a player's team member has the ball they can choose to pass it to another teammate, shoot the ball straight ahead or perform a clearing kick (if the goalie). If the player does not have the ball, they are given control of the nearest player to the ball and can slide tackles or shoulder tackles to try to gain possession. Each type of robot has a special move that can be initiated.",

In the league modes up to eight players can choose a team and play a season of 26, 52 or 162 games. Between matches players can change the line-up and rotation, and trade away players.\n\nGameplay is fairly tradition, with fielding, pitching, batting and baserunning. Next to fastball and curveballs, there are six different pitches such as Super Fast, Screwball, Super Curve, Slider, Change Up and Knuckleball.",

The standard punch is a cross, but by holding the Up-key pressed, jabs can also be thrown.\n\nBy avoiding punches and hitting them, a superpunch often becomes available, inflicting much more damage. A fight consists of a maximum of three rounds of three minutes each. When a boxer is knocked down four times, the match is over (technical knock-out). The same happens when a boxer goes down three times in a single round (regular knock-out). When down, players need to press both punch buttons in rapid succession to get back to their feet. The screen shows an energy meter drained when punches are received. After being knocked down and during intermissions, some energy is restored.\n\nAll versions, except for the Game Boy, can be played with two players. A password system is used to save the progress.",

You can either compete in an exhibition mode or play in career mode and become the greatest of all time.\n\nThe set of punches in the game is pretty much standard, jab, hook, uppercut, even the ever popular but illegal low blow.  Also, for each round and every knockdown you score on an opponent, you get a super punch, a straight shot to the face and is almost unstoppable and connected right could knock out your opponent, but if you miss, you lose your punch for the round.\n\nThere are two main displays during a fight, a damage inflict meter in the form of two boxing gloves, one on each side and as a player connects a punch, the glove will show a black area of where the glove connected and a damage meter that show's the two fighters faces.  As the round progresses, the fighter shows more bruises and cuts and starts to flash red when the fighter is getting tired and is the best time to land your super punch.\n\nAnother feature is from round to round, your view will alternate, from looking over your shoulder to the next round and looking at yourself over your opponents shoulder.",

The career starts out at position #25 in the ranking and players slowly work up the ladder, going to the gym in between bouts to build up stats to eventually take on \"Big Daddy\" himself, Riddick Bowe.\n\nThe game is practically a copy of Evander Holyfield's Real Deal Boxing, save for the graphics style and the included fighters.",

If the player loses against any of the 32 opponents, they are then eliminated from the tournament. The winner of that then goes onto the World Championship.\n\nAll of the gameplay is done from a top down view of the table. The player moves an icon to indicate location they want to hit the ball too. To aid in the aiming, a ghost of the cue ball and the first ball that is hit is repetitively played out to show the path of the hit ball. With the all the shots there is a very small margin of error, but this is only notable when a long shot is played or a shot from a sharp angle and the ghost balls will randomly play out all the possible occurrences. The player can also change the power and spin of the played shot with the ghost balls will updating to show the outcome of those changes. \n\nThere are 4 different game modes that can be chosen, each with a different set of pool games. The different game modes and there games are:\n\n<b>1. Tournament:</b> The player must defeat 32 different players in a first to four knockout tournament in 8-ball or 9-ball pool before going on to the World Championship. During the tournament the opponent is never actually is seen playing there shots. Instead, when it is the opponents turn, it cuts to an image of the player with a caption and then returns the control to the player with some balls removed and moved. This way the opponent can finish the game within 4 turns regardless of if they where snookered or not.\n\n<b>2. Challenge</b>:  It has many different pool games that are played, all with one player without an opponent. The games are:<ul>\n<li><b>14.1 Challenge</b> \u2013 After the break the ball is placed anywhere at the top of the table behind the line. At that point, the player can hit any ball but once the fails to hit a ball in a hole the game is over.
