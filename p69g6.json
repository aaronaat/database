      "description": "<i>Crazy Taxi</i> is an arcade-like racer where the player takes the role of a taxi driver who weaves his way through crowded streets, across sidewalks and even under water, in a wild and frantic race to deliver passengers on time. The courses are largely set inside cities crowded with general traffic and pedestrians (which can't be run over, they dive away). The main goal is to bring as many customers as possible to their destination in time. Available customers are marked through circles and the colour represents the distance and the fare they offer. Green means long rides with plenty of money, and red ones are very short. \n\nIn the main Arcade mode there is a timer that quickly runs down. It can be replenished by picking up customers. While driving reckless maneuvers are encouraged. Players can disregard all traffic rules and customers give extra tips for speedy and dangerous driving, but these can only be cashed when the customer arrives at his destination in time. By the same token the reward at the end of a ride is based on the amount of time left, as each customer also has a personal timer. The city is filled with slopes and jumps, and the game uses a very loose driving model. No damage can be done to the car, so driving as fast as possible is encouraged. While driving players can toy with the gears to perform two special tricks: a crazy drift and a crazy boost to speed up more quickly.\n\nNext to the Arcade mode there is an Original mode, and Crazy Box where specific goals need to be met on closed down courses. In the regular modes it is possible to disregard the usual timer and play for a fixed amount of minutes. At the end of the race the player is rewarded with a license, either D, C, B or A, with S for an outstanding performance. Next to the interactive courses from the arcade version there is a new course for home consoles. There are four cabs and drivers to choose from. The cars have different statistics and the drivers different attitudes while racing. The game has a soundtrack featuring The Offspring and Bad Religion (not for the Xbox 360 version).",

The goal is to reach the finish line in the shortest possible time on one of the four different tracks included. Of course, there will be obstacles on the tracks which will slow the player's car down if they're not careful. Numerous other cars will often get in the way, oil slicks will cause the player's car to temporarily lose control, and on the more difficulty tracks, narrow bridges will cause the player's car to come to a complete stop if they miss the path.

      "description": "<em>Dragster</em> is a drag racing simulation for one or two players. The object of the game is to be the first car to race across the screen in the two player game, or to race across the screen in the shortest possible time in a one player game. The joystick acts as both the gas peddle and clutch; you have the ability to shift from first through fourth, but be careful not to shift too soon because you can't downshift! You must also be careful not to rev your engine too much, or you'll blow your engine and be out of the race. There are two game variations included; in the simpler game, you just need to drive straight to reach the goal. In the advanced variation, you also have the ability to steer and need to keep your car driving straight between the bleachers and road divider.",

      "description": "The enemy army has captured too many of your forces. Being held in P.O.W. camps, these soldiers are effectively out of the war... unless some kind of rescue operation can be mounted. Heavy Forces are too slow and visible to be of any use, but perhaps something smaller and lighter may make it in where larger forces would fail. A small jeep, maybe two, crewed by about 4 people.... minimal enough not to represent too much of a loss and yet suitable enough to aid in rescue. But of course, if these brave men want to succeed AND come back alive; they'll need to fight like animals... they'll need to fight like jackals...\n\nJackal is an overhead view jeep game for up to 2 players. The controller moves in four directions, button A fires your grenades (upgradeable to bazooka) and button B your machine gun which ALWAYS fires to the top of the screen. Your mission is to locate facilities where soldiers are being held prisoner, rescue as many as possible, and escort them to a safe landing zone where they will be air transported away. After that, you'll need to fight a boss battle against the enemy to progress.\n\nThe NES version is not a straight port of the original Arcade game, but rather a remake. The Arcade version is a continuous battlefield, but the NES version is divided into 6 stages with a boss fight at the end of each stage. Also, enemy and hazard placements are quite different between versions.",

The race track is broken up into four quadrants; your racecar must remain in the lane it is in except where there is a break in the lanes between quadrants. Trying to stop you is a second car which travels in the opposite direction. This car will always be trying to get into the same lane as you, causing a crash, so you need to make sure you switch to any lane it isn't in! To help out, your racecar has the ability to travel at a fast or slow speed. You begin the game with three racecars, and the game ends when all three cars have crashed. A two player game variation is also available where one player controls a car trying to collect the dots, and the second player controls the crash car trying to stop the first player.",

The situation is gradually getting worse, as the rate of DomZ kidnapings increase. The Alpha Section forces, who are in charge of protecting citizens, seem to be completely ineffective, not even fighting the DomZ. In the midst of this situation, the secretive organization IRIS alleges that the Alpha Section is involved in a massive government conspiracy, and seeks to expose the truth through journalism.\n\nThe player controls a young reporter and photographer named Jade with her companions Pey'j and Double H. After experiencing first-hand a DomZ attack, she is contacted by IRIS, who recruit her as an action reporter. Jade is now tasked with infiltrating the Alpha Section, exposing the government conspiracy, and ultimately finding the truth for herself.\n\n<i>Beyond Good & Evil</i> is an action game with diverse gameplay. Much of the game is based on stealth and puzzles, but there are sequences of racing, shooting, combat, and platform action. Jade fights with her staff and also uses various abilities to execute long-ranged attacks and solve puzzles. Many of the puzzles require switching between the characters and using their special abilities; often it is necessary to coordinate the actions of two characters to achieve precise co-operation that leads to a puzzle's solution. Beside hostile areas with puzzles and enemies, there is also a city and other friendly areas to explore, where various items and gadgets can (and sometimes must) be bought. There are several mini-games and even an online ranking system (used by entering codes online after they are assigned in-game when the game is saved). ",

Your goal is to last as long as you can in an enduro race; each day of the race you are required to pass a certain number of cars. If you succeed, you get to continue on, fail and you are out of the race. The driving conditions will vary as the days pass by; not only will you have to drive at different times of day with different amounts of light, but the seasons can change as well. Snow, ice, and fog will occasionally appear to make driving more treacherous. With each day that passes, the other cars will become faster and more aggressive. At the bottom of the screen is an odometer, so when the race is finally over you can see how far you made it.",

The more cars you take out, damage you inflict, the more events and cars you can unlock. Burnout 3 also has a \"crash\" mode which puts your vehicle at a variety of traffic junctions jam-packed with moving vehicles and pickups to see just how much monetary damage you can inflict.\r\n\r\nBurnout 3: Takedown continues the racing series with more cars, more tracks, a more detailed crash engine, and a multitude of new gameplay modes for single players, multiple players on one system, and online play.\r\n\r\nSome features include:\r\n\r\nCrash Mode: In addition to this gameplay element introduced in Burnout 2, Pick-ups have been added. They are scattered throughout the intersections. Some pick-ups will halve, double or quadruple your score, cause massive explosions to cause even more damage, or increase your damage with monetary bonuses.\r\n\r\nSophisticated crash technology allows for high-speed crashes with extreme detail.  Use your vehicle as a weapon and takedown rivals, using the new Aftertouch feature to control your vehicle after the moment of impact.\r\n\r\n9 Race Modes including Single Race, Tournament, Lap Eliminator, Burning Lap and Road Rage.\r\n\r\nMultiplayer Modes include Quick Line, Battle Race, Road Rage, and Party Crash, where 2-16 players participate in a pass-the-controller match-up.\r\n\r\n7 Online Modes allow you to race online with up to 6 players.

      "description": "The events of the game take place in the early 1990's. The player takes control of Carl Johnson (C.J.), who had moved to Liberty City in order to distance itself from his past as a member of a gang in his home city, San Andreas. But the past catches up with him in a way he had not imagined: he finds out that his mother was killed by a rival gang. He goes back to San Andreas to attend her funeral. Realizing how corrupted local police is, seeing how his relatives and friends need him, determined to avenge his mother's death, C. J. has no other choice but revert to his old ways.\n\n<i>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</i> is the fifth game in the <i>GTA</i> series. The basic premise remains the same: roam the \"sandbox\" environments, hijack cars, and complete missions to advance the story. The game's world is significantly larger than in its two immediate predecessors, encompassing three cities and a vast countryside between them, with smaller towns, mountains, rivers, and other places of interest. The interactivity with the environment is enhanced, since the player character can now swim and dive, being able to access every corner of the game world.\n\nThe missions vary in structure and gameplay, including chases, races, longer and more intense third-person shooter sequences, as well as a wide variety of vehicles to navigate, which range from different new types of cars (such as lowriders), bicycles, motorcycles, to boats, helicopters, planes, trains, and exotic devices such as monster trucks and jetpacks. Some of the missions involve recruiting gang members and attacking turfs belonging to rival gangs.\n\nAs in the previous games, there are many activities to perform outside of the missions. Working as a taxi driver, taking part in races, delivering sick people to hospital, etc., return from the preceding games in the series. <i>San Andreas</i> adds many new activities of its own, some of them with a role-playing flavor. C.J. can go to gym and work out, increasing his stamina. From time to time he has to eat - though overeating will make him look fatter. He is also able to have romantic relationships with certain female characters, asking them out on a dinner, giving them presents, etc.",

If you fly to the wrong side of a pylon, you will get a three second penalty for each missed pylon. The total number of pylons remaining is at the top of the screen above the time. If you hit a tree, pylon or balloon your plane will crash to the ground. You will not die but this will hurt your time as your plane has to take off again. Hitting a pylon will not hurt your pylon count. You will still get credit for the pylon but will lose time as your plane was slowed. You can press the fire button to throttle up or release to throttle down. Move the joystick left or right to turn. You bank into turns so you need to time turns as it is not instant. Up and down on the joystick do nothing.",

      "description": "The fourth Burnout racing game puts you once again in the eye of traffic storms, where you do not only rush to be the fastest, but brutally, yet stylishly, take down your opponents. This is emphasized by <i>impact time</i>, which shows crashes in all their slowed-down glory, and the boost you receive after a successful wrecking. Reckless driving bumps your Revenge rank, unlocking new events. This can also be achieved by medal placings that grant new vehicles.\n\nCollectible signature takedowns, crashbreakers (detonate your vehicle, now also in some regular races) and aftertouch for precise havoc remain, but one of the major changes is the ability to check traffic. Non-racing vehicles are no longer a nuisance with the sole purpose of slowing you down. They can now be actively used to obstruct traffic or send them into your foes. The Road Rage mode (take down a set number of rivals within a time limit) and Crash mode make a return, but Traffic Attack is new - race against the clock and level the traffic at the same time. Other modes include regular races, grand prix races, Burning Lap (high-speed time attack), Eliminator (last one after each round is out) and a normal time attack mode.\n\nIn the Crash mode, the multipliers and bonuses have been removed, and you cannot drive at full speed towards a crossroads. You have to time your start to receive a proper boost and then it is only about steering, crashbreakers and aftertouch. There are many new tracks and cars, a soundtrack with lots of famous artists, and a new world tour in different countries.\n\nOnline multiplayer is available for up to six players. New off-line additions are the split-screen Traffic Attack and a hot-seat Crash Tour for up to six players, next to the familiar Road Rage, Crash Party and Crash Battle modes.",

The player must gain notoriety by racing in the streets and attracting the attention of the cops in order to ascend in the Black List of illegal racers. In the end he must face no.1, Razor who tricked him out of his own car and used it to get to the top.\n\nMany racing modes are carried on from NFSU2 with the addition of \"Milestones\", special events where the driver must evade capture and/or disable police cars by bringing down Pursuit Breakers, specially marked buildings such as gas stations and water towers. For each one of the 15 Blacklisted opponents, the player must win a specific number of events from each of the two main types and gain enough notoriety in the process. The player can invest bet money to buy new cars or improve his existing one's looks and performance so that he remains competitive.\n\nIn <i>Most Wanted</i>, Josie Maran replaces Brooke Burke as the racer girl. The plot is furthered through use of FMV video with live actors and digital sets, which has been heavily enhanced so that it looks quite real.",

      "description": "The Wild Wild West meets Grand Theft Auto in this free-roaming action game. Set in 1870, you are Colton White, a young gunslinger whose father is killed by an Indian tribe led by Reverend Reed. Just before passing away, your father hands you a token and reveals you are not his son. Sworn to avenge his death, you pursue the killers and unravel the secrets surrounding the item. Although you are on your own, temporary alliances can be formed with townspeople, Apaches and posse members, but watch your back as they can turn against you.\n\nThe main storyline, written by Hollywood screenwriter Randall Jahnson (The Mask of Zorro, 1998,) is linear.  You will have to fight duels, defend towns against bandits, help build railway tracks, intervene in various conflicts and kill heavily-armed bossed.  There are also many side missions or alternative ways to earn money. You can play poker in the casino, help out farmers with their livestock, assist the local sheriff or deliver items with the pony express. Other possibilities include bounty hunting, regular hunting for rare animals, mining for gold and various rescue missions. \n\nThe RPG elements involve acquiring and improving skills, such as QuickDraw (shown in Bullet Time,) Zoom Firing, Melee Combat, improved accuracy, the ability to throw axes and strategically equipping and upgrading different weapons.  There are hand weapons (knives, tomahawks, bayonets), archery arms, explosive throwable items and regular guns, such as sharpshooter rifles, colts and winchesters. Some are earned during the missions, others can be bought and sold for cash in the towns.\n\nThe GTA reference is reflected in the main means of transportation: horses. There are different animals to find with extensive movement options. Go on wild chases, spurt, gallop, do skid attacks, or trample your enemies. Give them some rest from time to time, or you will wear them down to death. In the melee combat, you can do roll maneuvers, use objects to provide cover, grab your opponents and even scalp them. You are free to steer away from the main storyline and explore the giant landscape, with towns, deserts, mountains, wilderness and caves.",

      "description": "Set in post-WWII New York City, <em>The Godfather: The Game</em> follows the player-created character's rise through a crime syndicate based on the book and film franchises. Combining events from the movie with side-story missions, the player must earn respect by completing missions in territories controlled by New York's five crime families.\n\nLargely open-ended, the game's story is driven by a series of missions where the player can use violence, intimidation, or diplomacy to affect the outcome and influence future events and other character's reactions. A third-person action game, <em>The Godfather: The Game</em> features a punching mechanism to brutally assert yourself, a car theft and driving engine, and a shooting system which allows for locational damage.\n\nThe game features a persistent offline world populated with locations from the franchise and characters who are often voiced by the actors who portrayed them onscreen.",

It combines racing with puzzles and even some platform action. \n\nThe game is built around a tour mode where the player must complete the stages one by one. Clear these stages by driving fast to the finish or try to top the times required to obtain bronze, silver, and gold medals. There are also stars to collect and a hidden item on every stage to discover. All of the levels are afloat in the air, so if the player happens to drift off the course, the car drops into nothingness.\n\nThere are many multiplayer modes, including bonus games such as soccer, ice hockey and a Snake game played with cars. In the track editor, players can construct their own gravity-defying tracks and share them through a wireless connection.  ",

The game also has 46 Challenges with 23 normal races and 23 funny mini-games such as bowling or table-soccer (everything with cars of course). On your way you pickup weapons and power-ups to ensure your lead.\n\nIn the race-challenges your goal always is to reach the finish line as one of the top 3 players. But the kind of challenge differs from normal race events over drive through checkpoints to simple time trials. \n\nThe mini-games always have different goals. In the bowling event you need to get down as many pins (or penguins on some tracks) as possible for example. Or you need to kick your opponents of a table three times while avoiding falling down yourself to win.\n\nTo play all challenges and power-ups free you need to get a specific amount of bronze, silver or gold medals which will be awarded if you reach specific goals in the challenges. For example in a normal race-event simply reach the first place for the gold medal.\n\nEvery challenge can (once played free in single-player) also be played in multiplayer with up to 4 players on one PC (Split-screen) or with up to 8 players in LAN or over internet. The AI fills in the missing players if wished. ",

      "description": "A city torn apart by numerous gang wars is in a volatile state and normal everyday people get caught in the middle. You would have been a victim of the chaos on the streets, had it not been for Julius, the leader of the 3rd Street Saints, you\u2019d have just been another statistic. Julius invites you to join them and unite the city under the 3rd Street Saints. With little doubt the rest of the feuding gangs will bring the city to its knees, you join him. However, you quickly realize that the major three gangs, the Westside Rollerz, Vice Kings, and Los Carnales aren't going to be easy to uproot at all.\n\n<i>Saints Row</i> is an open world driving and action game similar to Grand Theft Auto series. In the beginning of the game the player can customize the physical characteristics of the protagonist. The player then proceeds to do missions against any of the game's three gangs to advance the overall story, perform activities that range from stealing prostitutes to committing insurance fraud or becoming a hitman, or simply roam the city freely.\n\nFighting opposing gangs occupies the largest portion of the game. The Westside Rollerz are lead by Joseph Price and specialize in street racing and anything to do with cars; the Vice Kings are lead by the entrepreneur Benjamin King and are into prostitution, retail, and recording studios; Los Carnales are lead by Hector 'Kimo' Lopez and specialize in drug trafficking. The player character can get help from his gang members, who can provide backup in fights. Cars can be upgraded with body and performance enhancing kits. The game also features twelve radio stations to listen to.\n\nIt is possible to play with up to twelve people online in either co-op, deathmatch, team deathmatch, Big ass Chains (a mode where chains are collected by killing players for points), Protect the Pimp (where one team has a pimp and must keep him from getting killed by the other team), and Blinged Out Ride (where each team must collect chains to bling out their ride several times).

The complete island is accessible from the beginning and you can either follow the main storyline, engage in side-missions, or collect items all over the place. To help the revolution you can also drive the government out of the individual sectors on the island. This is accomplished by a three-stages fight in which you have to go up against a huge army of government forces.\n\nAs a fully trained agent, Rico can also perform many stunts. He has always an parachute equipped which he can open whenever he has enough speed. So he often uses cars or bikes as a jump-pad and then sails smoothly into the sunset.\n\nBut of course he cannot impress the evil regime with that, so he also has access to a wide range of weapons from pistols with unlimited ammo to rocket launchers and machine guns. Rico is also trained to drive everything that has an engine, from a normal bike to a fully-armed military helicopter.",

      "description": "The 2006 game in the <i>Need for Speed</i> series is an evolution of the gameplay introduced in the previous games. The career mode offers complete freedom in a city with a story mode supported by FMV cutscenes, as featured in Need for Speed: Most Wanted, but now also set in the Carbon Canyon, where racers duel for territory in the city below. There still are many police pursuits. At the same time, the focus on tuning and sculpting your car remains, as introduced in Need for Speed Underground. As you win money from races, you can visit garages and car lots to make improvements to your vehicle.\n\nEnhancements are still unlocked gradually, but the cars have now been divided over different tiers. There are about 40 cars to unlock. Many of them have been featured in previous installments, but there is a new selection and this year's edition introduces powerful muscle cars such as the Ford Mustang and Dodge Charger. Other features include the possibility to form your own crew, more detailed sculpting features, drifting races (introduced in <i>NFS:U</i> and replaced by drag races in <i>NFS:MW</i>) and the new car classes. The PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 versions offer online multiplayer, missing from the PS2, GC and Xbox releases. Up to eight players can race together, in the Pursuit Tag or Pursuit Knockout modes, with a few variations. Pursuit Tag is a race of one civilian car against cop cars. To become the civilian car, you have to tag it and then try to fend off the cops as long as possible until you are tagged again by other players. In Pursuit Knockout everyone starts as a civilian car, but the last one at the end of the first lap becomes a cop and needs to cause as much damage as possible to the other speeders. Another mode allows you to drive cooperatively (up to four players) in a single race.\n\nThe city and the surroundings in the career mode have been divided into different territories, controlled by gangs. You are either invited or challenged to race in the sections and claim them as your own. To do so, you have to impress the gang leader by winning races until he challenges you for a duel - first in the city, then over the narrow roads of Carbon Canyon. Scores are based on proximity. You need to follow the boss in the first race, and he is in pursuit in the second one. There are 4 boss duels in total.\n\nThe crew feature, with room for up to 6 cars, allows you to assign three roles to racers: drafters, scouts and blockers. These are supporting characters you can hire to help you win races. Drafters leave behind a coloured trail that makes it easier to find the way, scouts discover hidden shortcuts, and blockers try to cause mayhem to slow your opponents down. If you hire a scout, you get access to the new AutoSculpt feature. It enables you to modify the height of every part of your car through sliders, solely for visual effect. You can also buy full body kits.",

In <i>Pocketbike Racer</i> you get to choose from various Burger King characters including; The King, Brooke Burke, Subservient Chicken and Whopper Jr along with a biker and some generic humans.\n\nThe racing levels feature power-ups and weapons to use against your competition. You also have a Turbo bar that builds up depending upon your racing skills.  The levels include, King's Garden, Burger King Parking Lot, and Fantasy Ranch which features streets of cheese. The levels themselves include hairpins, straightaways, and jumps where you can test out the game's cartoony physics. \n\nThe game also features a somewhat limited create-your-own-character mode where you can recolor all the non-mascot characters.\n\nThe weapons you can use on the tracks include the standard rockets and lightning bolts as well as firecrackers and an attack to reverse an opponents control for several seconds. Your turbo/weapons meter is charged by passing through gates set up on each level. This can be used for turbo boosts of course, but it also controls the weapons.  The weapons are not picked up, but are available whenever you have your meter full enough to power them with the stronger weapons using more of the meter.",

      "description": "<i>New Rally-X</i> is a sequel to Rally-X. The player controls a blue racing car in a maze using a top-down perspective. While avoiding red enemy cars and rocks in Pac-Man fashion, there are flags to collect in each stage, with an increasing number of points per flag as a reward. When chased, the car can leave behind smoke to confuse opponents. Only a limited amount of fuel is available, which is consumed with time, and leaving behind smoke also depletes the meter.\n\nThere is a lucky flag that awards points for your remaining fuel and a special flag to double the points of all remaining flags. This remake features new courses, adjustments to enemy cars, new graphics and new background music.",

The racers are dropped into futuristic arenas to race and fight for their lives. Next to free play and arcade, this Xbox Live Arcade title also offers a career mode. There are different cars to choose from (24, with unlockables) and the initial abilities (power, defense, attack, and grip) can be boosted through power-ups inside the arenas. The 15 courses come with different game modes, such as deathmatch, beacon blast (checkpoint racing), survivor (last man standing), wrecking ball (demolition derby), hounded (tag racing), bot hunt, and more.\n\nThe arenas are bright, with obstacles and ramps. Opponents can be taken out with weapons to score points, but in beacon blast the ranking can also be improved by racing through beacons. As soon as one is passed, it reappears at another location. The standard weapon is a feeble laser, but five more become available later on, such as the plasma cannon, electricity blaster, flame-thrower, repel gun and gravity gun. There is no need to aim however, as all weapons automatically lock on to opponents. Next to the offline mode for a single player, up to 8 human players can race together online. Players can also unlock a fifth game type, SuperNova, and there are 12 achievements.",

With Pacific City under the iron grip of three ruthless gangs: Los Muertos, the Volk, and the Shai-Gen Corporation; the last hope rests on The Agency, a highly skilled group of law enforcers.  But the situation is dire, and desperate times call for desperate measures.  Using technology from one of Shai-Gen's scientists, The Agency is creating superhuman Agents to combat the crime and take back the city.  With constantly evolving skills which increase as you use them, you've certainly got the upper hand... but these gangs won't give back Pacific City without a fight!\n\n<i>Crackdown</i> is an action game from the creator of Grand Theft Auto; and presents the player with the fully explorable world of Pacific City.  Your main goal is to defeat the gangs that have taken over various parts of the city.  You're quite welcome to tackle each gang's head honcho straight off; however, it's to your advantage to take down the lower rungs in the gang ladder before you head for the top.  Doing so will cripple various parts of the gang, such as vehicles, cash flow, and new recruits.\n\nYour Agent can upgrade particular types of skills: Agility - your running speed and jump height; Driving - your control of different types of vehicles; Explosives - your skill and damage radius of explosives; Strength - your physical strength, which allows you to punch, as well as lift and throw heavier objects; and Weapons - your skill and accuracy with assorted types of weaponry.  Each type of skill is increased by performing the associated action.  Drive around and your Driving skill will increase, punch people in the face or throw garbage skips at them to increase your strength, and keep up the shooting to improve your weapon skills.  Agility is measured differently - scattered throughout Pacific City are green Agility Orbs.  Nab these, and your Agility will increase.  The higher up the orb is, the more it's worth.  You can also increase your Driving and Agility skills even further via special races which can be found around the city.",

      "description": "<i>Test Drive Unlimited</i> lets the player choose one of several characters, both male and female, waiting at an airport to check in for their flight to the Caribbean dream island O'ahu located in Hawaii. The characters do not have different statistics, that only applies to the extravagant, licensed cars.\n\nThe whole island is accessible from the beginning and after the player has bought his first home and car, he can either drive around and look for events or load up the map and jump directly to a location of a race, a car salesman or other locations - similar to Need for Speed Underground. Every bought car has a built-in navigation system, guided by a woman's voice to get the player to his destination, either pre-programmed in the game or decided by the player.\n\nThere are over 125 different cars and motorcycles in different price ranges to choose from. From the Audi TT over the Jaguar XJ200 to the McLaren F1 and Kawasaki Z1000, there is everything the character needs as a young man or girl with too much money on their hands. Each car has its own, realistic set of characteristics such as speed or handling, but they all have a highly detailed exterior and interior in common.\n\nThe character starts with $200.000 dollars in his pocket, but there will not be anything left after buying a first car and home. Additional cash needs to be earned in different kinds of races from checkpoint challenges to time trials. The money cannot only be used to buy new homes and new cars (and a little tuning for those), but also to buy new outfits for the avatar.\n\nThe heart of Test Drive Unlimited is the online mode. Using a GameSpy account, players connect to the official TDU server immediately after loading the game. New options become available online, such as a meeting lounge where the statistics and looks of other players can be looked up. It also provides access to player-created matches shown on the map screen. Creating a race  here also works in the singleplayer modes. At any location, the start and finish can be defined, as well as the type of the race, which type/classes of cars or bikes are allowed and how many people can participate. If not all slots have been filled up by other players, the AI will take control of the rest.\n\nThe PSP and PS2 versions have a lower visual quality and lack a few features, such as manual transmission, avatar customization, certain cars and all motorcycles, dealership and tuning shop NPCs, the vehicle interior camera angle and certain missions. They do include Master Points and Auto GPS, and certain default vehicles only available for the 360 version through download packs.",

      "description": "<i>DiRT</i> is the first racing game in the Colin McRae series not to solely focus on the rally championship. It features other offroad events with vehicles like buggies, jeeps or trucks all licensed from the manufacturers. Races are not always solo against the times of other drivers, but up to eight cars often race together on a single track.\n\nThe main game mode is the career where you work your up a pyramid of different tiers with events ranging from normal Rallies over Crossover or Corr to Hill Climb. For every event you complete successfully, you get points and money. Money is used to buy new cars. While the amount of money depends on choosing one of the five difficulty levels, the amount of points depends on your final result in the event; you receive the maximum of 10 points for completing an event with a first place regardless of the difficulty level. These points are needed to unlock new events in the current tier. If you have gathered enough points the next tier will be automatically unlocked so you don't need to do every race in a tier in order to unlock the final event at the top. The difficulty level not only influences the strength of the other drivers, but also how critical the damage is upon hitting obstacles. Some events are further split up into two or three races where the damage is carried over and the allotted sixty seconds worth of damage repair is not offered after every subevent. The main parts that can be repaired are the engine, turbo, exhaust, gearbox, bodywork, wheels, suspension, cooling system and it is also possible to clean the entire car.\n\nAll events feature several licensed true-to-detail-vehicles which also have a detailed damage model. Each vehicle can in addition be tuned in several categories like engine or suspension before each event. To help you make it even more individual, you can create your own look of the car with several dozens predefined kits. There are also 182 different liveries to collect in the game and 46 different cars.\n\nIn addition to the career mode, the game features the classic Colin McRae rally mode with four championships where you need to proof your worth in several car categories like 2WD or Classic. Of course you can also do a time trial, a single event or a single race.\n\nIf you're tired of driving only against the AI, you can go online and compete against up to 100 other players at the same time. An official ranking ladder is also available. After each race your best times can be compared directly to other drivers worldwide.",

There are 3 settings: Simulation (large impact of crashes), Limited (light crashes and only a small amount of damage) and Cosmetic (only visible damage, not affecting the car's performance).\n\nThe game modes include a career mode with different classes, time trials, free runs and arcade races. In the career mode, winning races unlocks manufacturer relationships and you can earn money to buy new cars or customize your vehicles.

      "description": "FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage is the third part in the FlatOut demolition racing series. Following the footsteps of its predecessor, this game is all about damage - earning points by driving is secondary to earning points by wrecking.\n\nThe game's appearance has been vastly updated compared to FlatOut 2. Not only is everything fully in High Definition, the game introduces a large amount of destructible scenery. Literally almost everything can be turned into debris, including traffic lights, fences, even plastic garden chairs.\n\n<i>Ultimate Carnage</i> not only introduces new graphics, it comes up with various new game modes such as the Deathmatch Derby, (in a perhaps intentional nod towards Destruction Derby 2) which feature a closed arena with no defined track; the game objective becomes from a circular racing track to a simple fragging contest.\n\nAs known from the previous editions, the game features both various online modes (all game modes can be played online as well), and the infamously goofy Ragdoll Olympics mode, where most game modes end up with the driver character exiting through the windscreen and ending in grievous bodily harm.",

However, the new heart of the game is the Racing career. There you not only create your very own character but you also fully customize your own ride from the general look to nearly every bolt inside. Every GrandPrix features the three stages practice, qualifying and race but you don't need to go through all of them. In addition there are three challenges for every course like Speed Run in which you've 45 seconds to reach the goal and if you're fast enough you can earn either a bronze, silver or a gold medal. The qualifying and race are also watched by the program and you can fulfill several goals like being 1st in qualifying or being on the podium at the end of the race.\n\nAt the end of each GrandPrix you not only get some money to invest into your ride but you also gain some credits with which you increase the stats of your character in the four talent \"Cornering\", \"Braking\", \"Top Speed\" and \"Acceleration\" to make him more like a Pro.\n\nThe fictional \"Extreme\"-mode is also part of the game again and the 17 old tracks have been revised and 20 new motorcycles are waiting to be driven around the courses in both single player and multiplayer.",

The game contains a host of new and old rally cars, as well as concept vehicles. Handling is loose and arcade-oriented, and the setup options are not as detailed as those in DiRT. \n\nThere are fifteen circuits across 5 terrain types - safari, alpine, tropical, canyon and arctic. As such, you must drive through snow, sleet, sand, mud, water and gravel. Track deformation technology ensures that no 2 laps are ever the same, as grooves are impacted into the ground and snow is moved off the primary racing line.\n\nGame modes include Quick Race, Championship, Time Attack and Online multiplayer. Time Attack allows plays to set their best times and upload them to 360 Live or PSN. Similarly, players can download other individuals ghosts and try to beat them. Online multiplayer caters for online battles between up to 6 players.",

Each level is based upon a movie and players will have to drive through the level, earning points by performing stunts. After the end of each level, players can review their performance by watching the movie trailer that was created.\n\nThere are six movies to choose from, each with different settings, goals and challenges: Aftershock, Whoopin and a Hollerin' II, Strike Force Omega, Overdrive, Never Kill Me Again and Night Avenger. Each movie consists of 6 scenes where the goals set by the director must be followed. To progress, a successful series of stunts is required, but the amount of points can be increased by linking them together and adding extra danger by drifting, getting airborne, or getting close to other cars and obstacles.\n\nThe multiplayer portion offers 2 game modes. In Backlot Battle players have to perform as many stunts as possible in a set amount of laps. Backlot Race offers straightforward racing where boost is earned through stunts. The PS2 version only offers offline gameplay, while the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions have multiplayer supported through the DemonWare middleware.",

The game doesn't have a Free Roam mode (as in Underground 2, Most Wanted or Carbon), but it has an Event Map, similar to Juiced's Event Calendar.\n\nThe player's main goal in this game is to become the \"King of the street\". Nothing new. However, there are no more illegal races in the game - all of the available races are sponsored, and the action takes place on different racing tracks. No more traffic, no more in-town driving.\n\nThe game features 2 gameplay modes. Career (you start your \"life\" as a lowlife race driver and over time you will conquer everyone) and free play (where you can race unlocked cars and unlocked tracks).\n\nAs usual, the game includes a jukebox where you can listen to some singles, used by EA as the game's Sound Track.\nThe game also includes new car models, and the classic racing modes except for cop chases, since ProStreet does not promote illegal racing. Also as usual, when you first start the game you will be prompted to create an alias (profile). You can choose which one will be loaded when you start the game again. After creating the alias, you are prompted to choose your difficulty settings.\n\nAll versions, except for the PlayStation 2 and Wii, contain online multiplayer modes.",

Most of the game's new content is provided through the Earn Your Stripes career mode (PS2).\n\nIn Earn your Stripes, you start by going through time trials to get better starting contracts. After you get a contract, you can start racing. You can tune up your car in the areas of acceleration, tire wear, top speed, among several others. After a set amount of races, you will need to go through another time trial to get to the next set of races. As you complete races and gain reputation, more contracts will come in. In every race, you need to complete some objectives set in your contract. Some contracts are easy to complete (such as finishing a race), while others give more complex objectives (such as gaining several allied cars). Players can also race in the Craftsman Truck, National (Busch), and NEXTEL Cup.\n\nThe PS3 and Xbox 360 versions allow players to share their setups online. The chase mode offers a series of challenges like drafting or passing to unlock new features. All versions offer online multiplayer races.",

      "description": "<i>Burnout Paradise</i> is the first installment in the long-running series, well known for its extreme 60-frames-per-second speed and crash-oriented carnage, to appear on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.\n\nThis title does away with menus to create a seamless integration of event gameplay and online interaction. Rather than dividing races into different sections, the player can fully explore Paradise City as an open world, where every junction is an opportunity to start an event. Just pull up at the traffic lights and rev the engine to start an event. The same applies to the Showtime mode (formerly Crash mode). The preset junctions and traffic are no longer present and the player can now crash at any location in the world, by activating the Showtime mode. It can also be used in regular modes, as well as online games. The main game mode has the player earn credit to unlock new licenses and cars. The five main event types are:<ul>\n<li>Race: the first one to reach the finish wins.</li>\n<li>Road Rage: perform a number of takedowns before time runs out.</li>\n<li>Marked Man: race for a location and survive the attacks from another car that tries to take you down.</li>\n<li>Stunt Run: use stunt moves to reach a target score.</li>\n<li>Burning Route: a unique route for each car in the game.</li></ul>There are more than 80 cars present and there is a reworked damage system. More parts can be torn off and the state of the car determines if the player can keep driving or has to wait for a reset. Objects in the environment can now also be deformed.\n\nThe game supports mugshots with support for a camera. When a player is taken down, both players have their photo taken, exchanged and saved on the hard drive. There are also camera-less persons or an avatar can be used.",

      "description": "The Serbian ex-soldier Niko Bellic had witnessed the horrors of war, which turned him bitter and cynical. Disappointed by life, he immigrates to the United States, which his cousin Roman enthusiastically describes as a country of wealth and pleasure. However, the reality is quite different: Roman is poor, has no stable job, and owes money to some dubious individuals. As Niko attempts to help his hapless cousin and pave a more secure future for both of them, he becomes more and more involved in the life of crime. A burning desire to find a man who had betrayed him in Serbia forces Niko to make deals with his conscience, and once he crosses the line, there is no way back...\n\n<i>Grand Theft Auto IV</i> is the ninth title and the fourth main game in the <i>Grand Theft Auto</i> series, and also the first for the seventh generation of consoles. Following the tradition of the 3D installments of the series, the game is entirely located in one of the three cities of the original GTA, Liberty City, but now in present time, and with an environment reminiscent of GTA III, though bigger and more detailed. Liberty City is heavily based on New York, where the protagonist has to gain respect, welfare and power throughout the game. \n\nLike in most <i>GTA</i> games, the city map is gradually uncovered during the course of the game. The player starts in Broker (based on Brooklyn), and, in order to access the other three districts of the city (based on the other major boroughs of New York City), has to make progress in the storyline. The game has the usual structure based on missions. The player can sometimes engage in various missions at the same time, and has free access to the non-mission features of the game while being on one.\n\nMost of the usual elements of exploration and interaction with the city are included in <i>GTA IV</i>. Niko can cause mayhem in the city, hijack cars, listen to radio stations, observe the behavior of the citizens, enter thematic buildings, work as vigilante, taxi driver, or ambulance driver, hire a prostitute, go to a strip club, and so on. Among the new features is the possibility to watch television (with several channels broadcasting various fictional programs) and connect to a fictional Internet, with functional websites (mostly of a humorous nature) created specifically for the game, and an e-mail program. Other additions include looking for criminals in the police department database from a police car, hiring taxi cabs to safely travel to selected destinations, extensive usage of the mobile phone, improved A.I. of the pedestrians, and others. \n\nSome features from the previous games are missing, such as drivable airplanes and a few other vehicle types. Niko retains the ability to swim and engage in romantic relationships with female characters, features first introduced in San Andreas. However, the light role-playing elements (training to increase stamina, eating, etc.) from the previous entry have been removed. \n\n<i>GTA IV</i>  focuses on third-person shooter gameplay more than the previous installments; most of the missions have larger portions dedicated to on-foot navigation and shooting. Crouching, leaning, and taking cover play a more important role in combat. Hand-to-hand combat has also been re-designed, Niko being able to execute more precise moves. \n\nThe game uses the euphoria motion engine, an alternate middleware solution much like ragdoll physics, which makes all people in the game world move realistically depending on the situation around them. For example, every time Niko enters a car, a different animation will be generated depending on his position relative to the car.\n\nA new feature compared to the predecessors is the multiplayer. The same free-roaming environment is offered for up to 16 players (32 in the Windows version) in 15 modes. Certain modes narrow down the environment to make sure players remain somewhat in each other's vicinity. Compared to the console releases, the Windows release features high resolution graphics, a video editor to capture and edit in-game footage, and the possibility to customize the radio station Independence FM with own songs.",

      "description": "The heart of <i>GRID</i> is the career-mode called GRID World. Divided into the three regions USA, Europe and Japan, the player has to earn money and prestige points to move up into a higher license category which then gives him access to more and harder racing events. These events are divided into categories like normal races, Drift-events, Destruction Derbies and even the famous 24 hours race in Le Mans.\n\nBut of course not every car is suitable for every event so there are several different series to chose from. So while the player drives a tuned car for the Drift- or Racing-events in Japan, muscle cars await him in for the Destruction Derbies in the USA or Formel 3000 racers in Europe. Each car also handles very differently. Of course the player needs to buy the suitable car first before he can enter a tournament. There he can decide if he wants to buy a brand new car or go over to eBay Motors and look for a solid used car which of course cost less but has already seen some crashes and might not provide the best possible performance.\n\nTo earn the money to buy a car for a event, the player can complete so-called Driver Offers. These are offers by other racing teams to take part in an event and see it through. But there are also bonus objectives like \"Finish before Team Top Secret\" which grant the player additional cash if he successfully completes them.\n\nBesides money the player also earns prestige points. These are required to unlock the next higher license category in the corresponding country. Of course tournaments give way more points than completing Driver Offers but the player can also get a few more points by adjusting the realism settings before the race. The higher the realism is, the higher the point gain will be after successful finishing the event. These settings include things like a difficulty level, traction assistant or how many flashbacks the player has available during a race. These flashbacks are similar to the Sands of Time in the Prince of Persia-Series. If the player for example drifts out into the gravel pit, he can activate the instant replay, rewind time a little bit and then immediately reenter the race at that point and try to avoid the crash.",

      "description": "A Venezuelan billionaire named Ramon Solano hires a mercenary to rescue general Carlos Carmona, who attempted a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat and failed. After  a successful completion of the objective Solano refuses to pay and tries to kill the mercenary, who barely escapes.\n\nAfterwards, Carmona and Solano take over Venezuela, pulling off a successful coup, capturing the country's oil platforms, putting the world on alert as they seize total control of the country. Unbeknownst to them, the mercenary has survived and is now plotting revenge against the two. The mercenary must take contracts from rival factions such as Universal Petroleum, an oil company whose business is threatened by Solano, the P.L.A.V. (People\u2019s Liberation Army of Venezuela), who are a force of rebel soldiers determined to take back their country, the Jamaican Pirates, who profit from Solano's forces, the A.N. (Allied Nations), who have entered the company to try and bring back stability to the region, and the Chinese Army, who hope to take control of Venezuela as well, marking themselves as a true superpower.\n\n<i>Mercenaries 2: World in Flames</i> is a free-roaming driving and action game. In the beginning the player selects one of three mercenaries from the previous game (Mattias Nilsson, Chris Jacobs and Jennifer Mui). Each merc has a special ability: Jennifer can run faster than others, Mattias regenerates his health faster, and Chris can carry more ammo. The gameplay is similar to that of the preceding game, with a few minor changes, one of which is a new way to hijack tanks: whereas in the previous game the player could simply walk up to the tank and automatically hijack it, it is now necessary to participate in quick-time events to get rid of the enemy gunner. It is possible to use a grappling hook to latch onto passing helicopters in order to hijack them. As opposed to the previous game, player characters can swim.\n\nThe protagonist now has a \"headquarters\" of sorts, where he or she can stockpile weapons, supply crates and vehicles. To obtain these stockpiles the protagonist must recruit three certain soldiers unlockable in the game: a helicopter pilot named Ewan Garrett, who delivers stockpile crates found by the player character to the headquarters; a mechanic named Eva Navarro, who will repair and stock vehicles, and is used for artillery strikes; and a fighter pilot named Misha Milanich, who is used for air strikes. Fiona Taylor reprises her role, giving the player technical information and training missions.\n\nThere is no more black market contacts to purchase supplies or airstrikes; instead players must take complete jobs for contacts scattered on the island. Completing jobs for these contacts will supply the headquarters with materials such as weapons, medikits, and artillery support. It is also possible to stockpile vehicles by driving back to their headquarters, keeping them at the garage for use in missions. Also, gas is needed to bring in supplies or call in airstrikes, which can be obtained by either completing contracts or collecting them scattered throughout the country.\n\nOnce again, bounties come into play, but instead of the \"Deck of 52\" from the first game, there are now \"High Value Targets\", military leaders that have defected from the Venezuela military and declared themselves independent from Solano as well as competing factions. They are scattered throughout the map; capturing them alive will grant the player character more money, while killing them will only net half the bounty as a reward. There are also \"treasures\" lying around the island, such as fuel cans, weapons schematics and even pirate treasure chests; each has their own monetary value for collecting them.\n\nThere are also new vehicles in the game, as well classic vehicles, such as modernized tanks, more powerful helicopters and even (for the first time) boats and other watercraft such as jet ski, as well as civilian muscle cars, high-end racing cars, and specialized vehicles for each faction.",

      "description": "<i>Pure</i> puts the player behind the handlebars of an All Terrain Vehicle (ATV) - better known as a Quad Bike, but instead of just choosing one from a pre-existing ensemble, he has to build his Quad Bikes from scratch himself.\n\nFrom the suspension over the engine to the form and color of the handle bars, he has many options to choose from. By playing through the heart of the game, the World Tour single player campaign, he unlocks additional parts by winning the events and collecting the flag hidden on the track. Some parts are purely cosmetically and don't change the stats of the bike but others have a great impact and come in a freestyle or race version. Deciding on which to use greatly influences how the Quad Bike behaves in terms of speed or how easy the player can perform tricks on it. Since the player also unlocks additional room in his garage, he can build the perfect Quad Bike for every one of the available game modes (Race, Sprint, Freestyle). This is especially important once the race has started because of the way how boost is handled.\n\nEach trick the player makes gives him more or less boost, depending on how good it was and such factors. That boost can then be used to give your Quad Bike a temporary speed advantage. But at the same time the amount of boost the player has collected, defines which tricks can be performed. At the beginning of the race, only basic tricks are available to the driver and as he gains boost, he first unlocks advanced and then professional tricks. So the player hast to decide if he wants to be able to perform more difficult tricks, and gain more boost with one trick, or if he will sacrifice this ability for a short speed advantage.\n\nWhile the game modes race and sprint are just races where the one wins, who is on the first position at the end, in freestyle the place doesn't matter. Instead the player needs to perform tricks to gain points. Once a trick has been successfully pulled off, a timer starts and when the player performs another trick before it runs out, the multiplicator goes up. There are also power-ups scattered around the map which allow the player to perform a special trick, double his points or refuel him a little. Especially the last one is important since the race goes on until the player runs out of fuel. Once everyone is out of fuel, the one with the most points wins.",

There is also a career mode, where the player advances through closed in courses, different from the original which had the player avoid against traffic while this version is a more organized feel to it.\n\nThere are authentic Exotics, European, Old Muscle and New Muscle cars to choose from including hundreds of actual racing parts giving them thousands of customization options even with the ability to customize labels and logos for their cars.\n\nThey can also hire and fire crews to work on the cars as well compete against real life drivers and their crews portrayed in the game.  Racing takes place all over the world, ranging from England to San Fransisco, even Australia and racing in Rome's famed Coliseum.\n\nEach version is almost similar, excluding the graphics depending upon each systems respective capabilities and track layout is a bit different in the Xbox 360 version.

It's up to you to help restore the records, and keep those candy-filled pi\u00f1atas coming!\n\n<i>Viva Pi\u00f1ata: Trouble in Paradise</i> is the sequel to Rare's gardening simulator, Viva Pi\u00f1ata.  The overall game remains the same - lure pi\u00f1ata by tending your garden.  Some animals are attracted by the appearance of others, while others will come because of the types of plants that you grow.  As you progress, the more valuable your garden will become - and that means that Professor Pester and his Ruffians will turn up to try to vandalize it, either causing fights with pi\u00f1ata, or smashing your most expensive object.\n\n<i>Trouble in Paradise</i> includes all the pi\u00f1ata from the original game, as well as some new species that can only be found by traveling to the Dessert Desert or the Pi\u00f1arctic.  These pi\u00f1ata are wild, and need to be lured with bait and caught.  Unfortunately, new Sour Pi\u00f1ata are also waiting to come in and cause problems for you as well.\n\nA new feature of the game is Pi\u00f1ata Vision, which uses the Xbox Live Vision Camera to scan in cards.  These cards can drop in an assortment of items into the game - anything from new pi\u00f1ata, to garden objects, to tools - even shop discounts!  Players can even take a photo of an object in their garden and transform it into a Pi\u00f1ata Vision card to send to a friend.  The game also features two mini-games - a Pi\u00f1ata racing game, and Pi\u00f1ata contest game.  Winning these mini-games increases your pi\u00f1ata's value.",

There are twelve different racing events to compete in:\n<ul>\n<li>Circuit Races</li>\n<li>Unordered Races</li>\n<li>Freeway Races</li>\n<li>Time Trials</li>\n<li>Tournaments</li>\n<li>Red Light Racer</li>\n<li>Series Races</li>\n<li>Wager Races</li>\n<li>Pinkslip Races</li>\n<li>Delivery</li>\n<li>Payback</li>\n<li>Telephone Challenge</li>\n</ul>\nPolice are also present in the game, patrolling the streets of L.A. and breaking up street races.  The police will pursue the player with an army of squad cars and even helicopters and spike strips to try and bring the player to a stop at all costs.\n\nThe main mode of the game is a story mode where the player takes control of a created racer, racing in an illegal racing circuit, earning money and \"REP\" to unlock and buy upgrades to finely tune their car.  Players can also use these \"REP\" points to unlock and purchase more powerful cars.\n\nThere are also four different \"attacks\" the player can deploy during the race to either slow down opponents or completely stop them.  <i>Zone</i> is a slow-motion option where the player can slow down time and use this to avoid oncoming traffic or police cars.  <i>Agro</i> gives the player's car more strength with the ability to smash into opponents or completely disable them.  <i>Roar</i> has a shock wave emanate from the player's car to push opposing cars and traffic to the side to create a path.  <i>EMP</i> sends an electromagnetic pulse that will disable the engine of any opponent or pursuing police car.",

      "description": "<i>Need for Speed: Undercover</i> is the 12th installment of the series and puts the player in the shoes of an undercover cop who needs to infiltrate and destroy an international crime syndicate by getting to their leader - a man crazy behind the wheel and a very fast driver. So the player enters the city with the goal to earn enough reputation and respect in the syndicate to get to him.\n\nOf course this is not done by just walking up to someone and asking nicely. Instead the player freely roams the big city in his cars and accepts missions at every corner. These range from simple races to Burnout-inspired \"Destroy as much as possible\" goals. A completely new mode is the Highway Battle in which the player needs to put 300 meters between him and his opponent with the main enemy being the incoming rush hour traffic. Other missions require the player to bring a specific car in the best possible condition to a garage. Since the player is undercover, the police are always watching him and make his life more and more difficult as the wanted level of the car increases.\n\nSuccessful races not only earn the player reputation to unlock new challenges and new parts of the city but also bring cash which can be invested in new cars or in the tuning of old ones. In addition one of the ten stats of the character automatically advances granting him more money for a win or increasing his ability to brake.",

Their evil foe, Gruntilda (now nothing more but a skull) finally makes it back to Spiral Mountain to start another fight.  Their feud is soon put to a stop by the Lord Of Games, creator of every game ever, who is sick of their constant bickering.  Confiscating Grunty's magic and Kazooie's special moves, L.O.G. proposes a challenge of his own design - the winner gets the title deed to Spiral Mountain...while the loser gets to spend eternity toiling in his video game factory!\n<br><br>\n<i>Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts</i> is a sequel to the N64 game, Banjo-Kazooie.  Players explore the world of Showdown Town, which houses Mumbo's Garage - this garage allows players to construct any vehicle imaginable as long as it follows some simple basic rules - it needs an engine, fuel, and a seat for Banjo to sit in.  Apart from that, anything from hovercrafts to planes to trucks to rockets to unicycles (and more!) can be created.  Showdown Town leads to many more worlds, each created by L.O.G..  These worlds house challenges - it's up to the player to build the most appropriate vehicle for that challenge.  Solving each challenge earns Jiggies, which are puzzle pieces used to open up more worlds and finally face off against Grunty herself for the grand prize - the deed to Spiral Mountain.\n<br><br>\nThe game also allows players to compete online against fellow Xbox Live players, as well as exchange blueprints to their vehicles, video replays of their challenges, and in-game photos.",

In either case, they must go through a series of six 3/4 view maps which are city-themed with roads, building, lakes, etc. In each map, their character is upgraded with new abilities, such as faster speed or tighter turns. The player controls their character with the thumbstick and has a limited turbo dash. \n\nIn the driver game, players avoid the T-Rex while attempting to drive over delivery icons to deliver Doritos. Running into a building slows the player down, and getting eaten causes them to reset elsewhere on the map. In the Tyrannosaurus game, players attempt to catch and eat Doritos delivery trucks. In order to do this, they can stomp through the buildings, crunching them; though this also slows them down. \n\nIn some levels, the objective is to get a certain number of deliveries or eats before time runs out. In others, there will be a competing T-Rex or delivery truck and the player must rack up a target number of eats or deliveries before they do.\n\nAdditionally, there are two multiplayer modes. There is a tag-like Zen Mode where one player is a truck and the rest are T-Rexes. Eating the truck makes you the new truck. The goal is to reach a target number of deliveries first. The other is Chaos mode, where players are either a T-Rex or delivery truck for the whole match and the goal is to be the first to reach a target number of deliveries or eats.\n\n<i>Doritos: Dash of Destruction</i> is free to download and play.",

      "description": "At the end of Saints Row the city of Stilwater was in the hands of the 3rd Street Saints. But the main protagonist also got blown up on Mayor Alderman's yacht, putting him in a coma. So things went down from there.\n\nTwo years have passed now and the main protagonist finally wakes up from their sleep only to find themself in prison and the city of Stilwater controlled by several rival gangs, with Johnny Gat about to be put on the electric chair. With the help of Carlos, a fellow inmate, the protagonist escapes, rescues Johnny Gat and once again begins to reform the gang and move the 3rd Street Saints back up to number 1.\n\nBefore the player can enter the open and non-linear environment of the city, they need to define who the main protagonist is by using an extensive character creator which allows for changing everything from gender to the size of the characters ears and the voice acting. But that's not the limit of customization in <i>Saints Row 2</i>. In shops scattered all around the city the player can buy additional clothing from underwear to hats to not only change their appearance but also the gang's. These clothes are then also available in the up to six cribs the player can unlock and buy during the course of the game. Besides changing their appearance, the player can also stash weapons and cash there, withdraw the daily earnings, rewatch cutscenes and more. He can also change the overall style of the crib and buy new stuff like a TV-set which grants him additional style points.\n\nStyle and Respect are the most important currencies besides money in the city. While respect is used to unlock missions and progress through the storyline, the player's style affects the overall respect modifier increasing the amount of respect earned. As stated style points are earned by upgrading the characters look, home or car. Respect points are instead earned through the many activities and diversions available in the city.\n\nActivities are mini-games that are started at a one of two specific points in the game world and span out over six difficulty levels. After completing three levels, the player gains unlockables like a 5% discount on clothes. Besides activities already known from <i>Saints Row</i>, <i>Saints Row 2</i> includes six new ones including \"Crowd Control\" in which the player needs to protect a VIP from intrusive fans and \"FUZZ\", a parody of COPS in which the player is followed by a camera crew and has to deal with criminals in a very creative manner to gain points. Diversions on the other hand include the simple driving on the wrong side of the road, doing stunts, playing poker in a casino, hijacking a car with more than one person in it and taking the passengers hostage and doing the job side-missions like driving the tow-truck or playing taxi.\n\nThe game also features several multiplayer modes ranging from a two-person coop-mode to twelve player deathmatch (\"Gangsta Brawl\") and team-deathmatch (\"Team Gangsta Brawl\") and a mode called \"Strong Arm\" in which the team wins that manages to earn $100.000 first. This is accomplished by winning events based on single player activities like racing. Each activity has a time limit and at the end the winner goes home with $10.000.",

      "description": "<em>Baja: Edge of Control</em> is an off-road racing game based on the real-life Baja 1000 race series held in California. The tracks are set in a desert environment and there's over 1000 miles of route to explore. In the main career mode, the idea is to start at the bottom class of off-road racing with a VW Beetle. By performing well in races, players earn prize & sponsorship money and experience points to buy better machines and unlock higher classes. In order to secure the sponsorship money, their logos must still be on the car at the end of the race, so too much damage to the car will result in the player not getting paid. The vehicles can be tuned and modified to increase performance.\n\nThere are five different race modes; circuit which is a standard race where you do a few laps of a track against opponents, rally which a point to point time-trial, hill climb which as it suggests is drive up a steep hill, and then back down, open class where different categories of car race against each other with a handicap system in place to disadvantage the more powerful ones and Baja which is an endurance race lasting between 250-1000 miles. The Baja mode races can last up to several hours.",

      "description": "Milo Burik is a Wheelman. He drives people around who have a need for speed and less of a need for compliance with traffic rules. Milo is also an undercover-agent sent to Barcelona to infiltrate the local underworld but he soon finds himself between the fronts of an all-out gang war between three rival groups.\n\nThe player takes on the role of Milo Burik looking over his shoulder while freely walking and driving around the city. As a Wheelman Milo doesn't just drive his car or motorcycle he also uses them as a weapon. By swinging the mouse or using one of the sticks, the player rams his car into other cars until they go up in flames. It also allows him to quickly switch lanes or ram through barricades. By destroying other vehicles, speeding and generally reeking mayhem in the city, the player also fills up his focus power which is needed for special attacks. Utilizing this power allows him to get a speed boost, get perfect aim at high speeds or perform a 180\u00b0 turn, aim and destroy his chaser with one shot. But his car isn't Milo's only weapon. Pistols, machine guns and such too await to be used outside and inside cars and if his own car is about to blow up or if he just doesn't like the color anymore, he can perform an air jack. An air jack is possible once Milo's car is close enough to another car or motorcycle. After releasing the corresponding button, he then jumps over, removes the original driver and continues on his journey in his new vehicle.\n\nAll this is used to advance in the main storyline as well as in the many side-missions the player can take on. These range from Taxi-missions in which the player needs to get a passenger to his goal as fast as he can, to rampages in which destruction is everything and capture and delivery missions in which Milo needs to use his air jack ability to steal a specific vehicle and get it to the drop point in time. In common have all that at the end the player is rated based on his performance with \"S\" being the highest rank and \"C\" the lowest. If the player managed to get at least an \"A\" he unlocks additional missions and ultimately access to additional repair shops and weapon depots. Once unlocked the next story mission as well as every side-activity can be accessed directly from the city map on the PDA.",

      "description": "<i>FUEL</i> is a free-world racing game. Players can explore a 14.000 km\u00b2 area of Northern America after the effects of global warming took place, rendering it desolate with abandoned cities, broken vehicles and almost no survivors. The goal is to win races, which provides fuel that can be exchanged for new vehicles. The game world is divided in nineteen separate zones that need to be unlocked by collecting stars \u2013 provided through winning career races. Up to 75 different types of vehicles can be unlocked during the course of the game. The vehicles can be modified with paint jobs and liveries.\n\nBesides the regular career races, which are restricted to a specific vehicle class like ATV, buggy or motorbike, challenges are another event type in the game. These include for example chasing a helicopter through the terrain or trying to touch other vehicles within a given time limit. Next to the races and challenges that can be accessed right away, the game also offers the ability to drive freely in each of the zones to explore the environment. This is further encouraged by having to locate new liveries, vista points, and doppler trucks that show the locations of all items. The terrain is dense and the appropriate vehicle needs to be selected to explore freely. There are many extreme weather effects, such as pouring rain, snow, thunder storms and even hurricanes.\n\nThe general gameplay is arcade-like. Even though the terrain affects the performance, vehicles cannot be damaged and there is an option to respawn when crashing into objects. The roads are littered with obstacles and the game encourages to break away from the regular tracks to locate shortcuts and use jumps to cross large distances. Players can also create their own tracks through waypoints in the zone. A general HUD shows the race statistics and marks the course, along with a mini-map. <i>FUEL</i> can also be played online against up to 16 players.",

      "description": "<i>Red Faction: Guerrilla</i> is the third entry of the Red Faction series and deviates from the first-person shooter genre that the previous two incarnations featured and incorporates an open world sandbox environment similar to Mercenaries, Grand Theft Auto or Saints Row ( which the developer, Volition, has also developed).\n\nSet 50 years after the events of the first two games, Mars has been liberated from the devious Ultor Corporation by Red Faction and the E.D.F. (Earth Defense Force) has stepped in to help the Miner Community get back on their feet.  However, the E.D.F. has become an occupying force, taking over the planet, executing citizens and imposing martial law on the planet.  As a result a new Red Faction element has been formed to fight the E.D.F. and once again bring peace and freedom to the Martian landscape.  The player takes control of Alec Mason, a recently arrived dissident of Earth hoping to make his new life on Mars with his brother Dan, only to be swept up in the Revolution and free Mars five sectors (Parker, the Badlands, Oasis, the Free Fire Zone and Eos) from E.D.F. control.  To do this the player must complete missions and destroy E.D.F. vehicles and property, lowering their control on each sector and raising the morale of the resident population.\n\nThe missions range from story missions which purpose is to further advance the story and other missions including Transporter (returning certain vehicles to a safehouse in a certain amount of time), Guerrilla Raid (where the player and a group of Rebels attack and E.D.F. building and destroying it), Heavy Metal (where the player provides a distraction which allows fellow rebels to complete another mission without alarming the E.D.F.), Demolition Master (which the player has to destroy a target within a certain time limit and a limited supply of ammo) and House Arrest (where the player must rescue hostages and return them to a safehouse).\n\nThere are also missions that pop-up from time to time including Courier (where the player must track down and kill an enemy spy to collect the information he is carrying), Assault (where the player must defend a certain target against incoming E.D.F. forces) and Convoy (where the player must either destroy a line of vehicles or capture a target vehicle and return it to a safehouse).  Completing these missions will drop enemy control of the area, raise morale of the citizens, be awarded scrap and unlock more advanced weapons.  To liberate each section the player must drop the E.D.F. control of the area to zero and complete the story missions, once the player meets this a final story mission will be unlocked which will liberate that sector and unlock story missions for the next.\n\nPlayers have a variety of vehicles to choose from, ranging from cars to trucks, dune buggys and dump trucks and even tanks and APC's (Armored Personal Carriers).  There is also a plethora of weapons including pistols, shotguns, assault rifles, the sledgehammer (the players main weapon which can't be removed), remote mines, anti-personal mines, rocket launchers and the dreaded Nano Rifle (which fires a stream of nanobots that can disintegrate targets within an instant).  The player can carry four different weapons at a time and can swap them out through access at their safehouses or through ammo boxes littered throughout the landscape.  The most advanced weapons such as the Nano Rifle is only unlocked through the story missions while some can be found in E.D.F. buildings (like the Singularity Mine) and each weapon can be upgraded through safehouses which include extra ammo and more firepower through scrap.  Scrap is the game's currency which is obtained through completing missions or destroying E.D.F. buildings and vehicles.\n\nThe game also has an updated Geo-Mod 2.0 game engine which allows the player to virtually destroy a building realistically such as making it lean left by blowing up the left side of the structure or lean forward if the front is blown apart.  Players can use this to their advantage against enemies such as destroying the building from the ground floor, toppling it on enemies and vehicles or destroying the support structures of bridges with explosives, causing it to collapse with a convoy of enemies on top.  It also features the physics engine, Havok for the character physics.\n\nThere is also an offline two-player mode called Wrecking Crew where two friends take turns on four different modes such as <i>Barrel Dash</i>, <i>Total Chaos</i>, <i>Rampage</i> and <i>Escalation</i> and play a certain set of rounds to win an event.  Online multiplayer games are present as well including <i>Anarchy</i>, <i>Team Anarchy</i>, <i>Capture the Flag</i>, <i>Damage Control</i>, <i>Siege</i> and <i>Demolition</i> which awards players experience points that they can use to customize their online players and acquire more advanced weaponry.  Additionally, there are backpacks for the <i>Wrecking Crew</i> and <i>Multiplayer</i> modes which enhances the players abilities such as Jetpacks, Stealth, Vision (essentially an X-ray) and more power-based ones such as Concussion, which will knock over nearby enemy players and Tremor, which can damage enemies as well as structures.\n\nThe PC game comes with the DLC Demons of the Badlands included which was previously only available for the Xbox360 and PS3 consoles.",

      "description": "The player's goal in <i>Need for Speed: SHIFT</i> is to take part in the Need for Speed World Tour and become the ultimate champion. As opposed to its predecessors, this doesn't mean racing around an open-world city with pimped cars. Instead the game is more similar to GRID with races taking place on closed city circuits or even famous race tracks like the Circuit de Spa-Franchorchamps.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, the player drives a test-round as well as a race. During this tutorial the game evaluates the player's skill and changes the realism settings accordingly ranging from the usual arcade-style controls with many driving aids to an almost realistic simulation-like driving model. Then the main game begins where the player has to successfully earn stars in order to unlock the next tier and ultimately gain access to the World Tour. Stars are earned by getting on the podium at the end of a race as well as by fulfilling certain objectives on the track. These range from simply gaining a specific amount of points in the race to more challenging objectives like driving a clean lap. Points on the other hand are earned by the player through his driving style and are separated into two groups: Precision and Aggression. While the first group honors clean sectors or driving on the race line, aggression-points are earned by hitting other cars or sliding through curves. Once the player has earned enough points (both categories are summed-up at the end of an event, he gains a level and by doing so unlocks new upgrades for his car, get's a big money bonus or receives an invite to a special race event. To keep the player even more motivated, tons of badges are waiting to be earned which are in part also the same as the available achievements/trophies. Again actions like performing 25 overtakes or winning three consecutive races are needed to earn a minor badge. If he keeps his streak up or has earned all the minor badges in one category, he earns additional badges ranging from bronze to epic.\n\nThe available events include normal races in various variations, a time attack mode, a car attack in which the player needs to be either five seconds in front of his opponent or get 1st place in order to win and drift events. The car park includes many licensed cars from normal middle to high class vehicles to high-powered racing cars which can all be bought through the money earned by winning races or leveling up. In addition the look of the car can be changed by unlocking new vinyls. Also available are extensive upgrade and tuning options allowing the player to change every detail on his car down to the tire pressure.",

It details the Covenant's invasion to Earth in year 2552 from the point of view of the Orbital Drop Shock Troopers. The player takes the role of various members of the ODST squad in the war-torn city of New Mombasa - most prominently The Rookie, who can be considered the protagonist of the game.\n\nA departure from previous games in the Halo series, <i>Halo 3: ODST</i> is more open-ended and features more exploration. The new VISR visor system can provide light amplification and is used to identify friends and foes. The visor also provides map, navigation data, and link-up with the AIs that run the city. The players are also no cybernetic super-soldiers this time; player stamina and health are bigger factors than before, and both the speed and jump height are scaled back.\n\nThe game features a Firefight mode, a four-player cooperative game mode that is centered around the campaign. Rather than the hardcore sci-fi of previous editions, <i>ODST</i> has influences of film noir and jazz-like elements to complement the soundtrack.\n\n<i>Halo 3: ODST</i> also includes <i>Halo 3: Mythic</i>, which is essentially a stripped-down, multiplayer-only version of <i>Halo 3</i>, and includes all <i>Halo 3</i> downloadable maps, including Heroic, Legendary, and Mythic map packs and three previously unreleased maps.",

      "description": "<i>Crash Time III</i> is the seventh main game in the long-running German <i>Alarm f\u00fcr Cobra 11</i> series. It is based on the German action police series of the same name that first aired in 1996. In this driving game players control a car with detectives Semir Gerkan, one of the original characters, and Ben J\u00e4ger who was first introduced in the TV series in the 24th season in September 2008.\n\nThe game is set in a large, living city that can be freely explored. The main career mode is centered around a terrorist attack on an international airport. Initially starting seven days before those events, Gerkan and J\u00e4ger drive around performing patrol duties until they get involved with the gangsters behind the attacks. Most of the missions are centered around tasks such as tailing, stopping and shooting suspects, escort missions and reaching destinations in time (including getting breakfast). Most of the missions have a time limit that can be extended a few times, but at the loss of star ratings that open up new options in the game.\n\nThere is a wide selection of cars that can be unlocked gradually, with different categories such as American Cobra, Cobra Special, Transporter, Road Chief, Race Car and Police Car. There are about 40 vehicles and they are rated based on top speed, acceleration and handling. Cars take damage and the detectives also need to pay for damage inflicted to property or other vehicles. Using the siren or the horn, the traffic will adjust its behaviour. While driving, a large arrow shows the general direction of the objective and the remaining distance. There is also a top-down road map that can be consulted. There are different precincts and many distinctive areas and buildings such as the airport, the highway, hotels, churches, hospitals and a harbour. All cars have a nitro option for additional speed, with a recharge time.\n\nNext to the main career mode, there is also an option to do races against other cars and a split-screen multiplayer mode on a single computer for up to four players.",

      "description": "Sean Devlin is an Irish mechanic and a racer in Paris - or at least he was. One day in 1940, as he takes part in the Grand Prix of Saarbr\u00fccken (Germany), he loses to the Nazi Kurt Dieker through unfair means. As he tries to repay his dept by playing a prank on Dieker, he learns of Diekers real job: being a Nazi torturer. Sean manages to escape back to Paris with the Nazi invasion force on his heel. The game begins three months after these events in the now occupied Paris, where Sean meets the Resistance and more or less willingly joins up with them in order to execute his revenge on Dieker.\n\n<i>The Saboteur</i> is a GTA-like open-world driving and action game set in Paris during World War II. The player takes on the role of Sean, looking over his shoulder while he explores the city and its surroundings either on foot or by car. In order to move the story forward, the player has to fulfill missions for the resistance. There is also a considerable amount of side-missions as well as many other things to do in the city, including - but not limited to - blowing up sniper towers and Nazi tanks and killing Nazi generals. These so-called sabotage actions also net the protagonist contraband, the currency of the game. With it he can buy weapons, upgrades and other items at black-market dealers scattered around the city.\n\nTo do these sabotage acts, the player has access to several different kinds of weapons and explosives from the time period, as well as Sean's fists for melee combat. Though Sean can engage Nazis in hand-to-hand fights, using punches, kicks, and grapple moves, it is often not advisable to go directly into combat, as he needs to escape the Nazis once an alarm has been raised in order to complete his missions. In addition, the alarm level will creep up over time if Sean does additional damage to Nazi property and personal, alarming even heavier forces including tanks and zeppelins. To escape an alarm, he either has to leave a certain area quickly or enter one of the many hide-spots while not being seen.\n\nAfter completing a certain mission, Sean will also be able to call Resistance fighters at his side to help him in combat or bring him a getaway car. These getaway cars need to be collected first by driving them into a black market garage. Once this has been done, the car can be summoned at any garage. \n\nThrough his actions the player also unlocks perks granting certain rewards, e.g. \"Sucker Punch\", which is gained after killing ten enemy soldiers without them ever knowing. Sean can even slip into an enemy uniform to infiltrate the Nazis undetected; however, if he is seen doing a suspicious activity, the alarm will be raised after a certain amount of time. Other prominent activities include running and climbing on buildings, similarly to the protagonist of Assassin's Creed, giving the player the freedom to choose his own route to the target.\n\nAt the start of the game, Paris and its surroundings are covered in black and white in a very similar style to the one seen in the movie <i>Schindler's List</i>, with only certain colors standing out, such as the red in every Nazi-symbol and the yellow lights behind windows. As the player helps the Resistance liberate the sectors, color returns and Nazi activity goes down.",

      "description": "As it's predecessor, the racing-game <i>DiRT 2</i> doesn't just focus on accurately simulating the Rallye-sport like the earlier installments of the Colin McRae-Series did. Instead eight types of Offroad-events await the player during the main campaign called DiRT Tour:\n<ul><li><b>Rallye</b> - The player has to get as fast as possible to the finish line. He's the only one on the course at the same time and instead has to deal with hairpin curves and difficult terrain.</li>\n<li><b>Trailblazer</b> - Basically the same as Rallye but instead of narrow courses, this mode features long and open stages.</li>\n<li><b>Raid</b> - Races over wide and open terrain with many dangerous shortcuts allowing the player to get distance between him and the other drivers.</li>\n<li><b>Landrush</b> - All drivers start at the same time and the tracks are littered with crazy curves and jumps.</li>\n<li><b>Rallyecross</b> - Takes place on round-courses with a mix of dirt and asphalt streets.</li> \n<li><b>Gatecrasher</b> - The player has a limited amount of time to get to the finish line. To replenish that time, so-called gates are scattered around the track each granting +2 seconds upon destruction.</li>\n<li><b>Domination</b> - Similar to Rallye, the tracks are divided into sectors. Each sector gives 1-10 points depending on how fast the player in relation to his opponents finishes it. In addition 1-10 points are added for his final position in the race once he crosses the finish line. The winner is the driver with the most points.</li>\n<li><b>Last Man Standing</b> - As the name implies, the goal here is to race around the course and be the last car in the race at the end with the last car being removed after each lap.</li></ul>\nEach event requires either a different car or at least a so-called race-pack for that car both bought with the money earned by winning these events. Each car can be customized both visually and under the hood with parts unlocked by gaining a level. Experience points are awarded both for finishing races as well as completing missions like jumping over the finish line or getting through a race without any damage. The amount of cash earned at the end of each race, is influenced by the difficulty level. The higher the difficulty, the higher the reward. In addition the difficulty-level also changes the amount of flashbacks that are available for the race (from five to none). Flashbacks allow the player to rewind the action a few seconds when he made a mistakes or crashed and allows him to try that section again - hopefully without making the same mistake a second time.\n\nThe game features many real-world racers including their voices and their cars who give the player tips during the course of the DiRT-tour and also offer him additional challenges including duels and time trials. They'll also take part in team-events with the player, if he keeps them happy by not crashing into them that often during races.",

      "description": "<i>Crash Time II</i> (<i>Alarm f\u00fcr Cobra 11: Burning Wheels</i> in Germany) is a action game based on the German TV series <i>Alarm f\u00fcr Cobra 11</i>. The player takes the roles of the main characters Semir Gerkhan and Ben J\u00e4ger which are members of the freeway police. During the game they solve 32 missions, e.g. infiltrating an illegal racing club or rescuing hostages. Some of these missions are tied together but basically they are just episodes and tell no overall story. The cutscenes consist of camera shots around buildings and cars and voice acting from the original actors.\n\nFor the first time in the series it features a freely explorable town divided into two parts (city and freeway) but nonetheless the most time is spent doing one mission after another. The only thing accomplished by exploring the town are collectable car parts which improve the standard car. New missions are started when receiving radio calls by colleagues or sometimes by driving to a certain point on the map. During the game the player never leaves his car, typical goals are to stop another car (by thwarting it, shoving it a few times or crashing it), reaching a goal respectively driving through checkpoints in a limited time or beating regular races against time or other vehicles. Mostly he also has to limit the damage he does to his and other cars. Since the game is based on an action series there is usually no problem when crashing a few times, the player only has to watch that he doesn't lose his wheels because this influences the handling of the car.\n\nMost missions are divided into secondary missions which are solved linearly. For example in one missions the player firstly has to reach a goal without causing too much damage, then tailing a truck, overtaking the truck, crashing an enemy and driving back to headquarters. The player can repeat a secondary mission as often as he wishes and also quit altogether. Later he can access this secondary mission (and already solved cases) through a case list in the main menu without having to start the free driving mode. \n\nWhen starting a new mission the player can choose between three difficulty levels. Every time the players beats a mission he unlocks new starting positions on the map, new cars and new missions. Because some missions require a certain car to start suitable cars are marked with a flag besides them. There is also a mode where the player can race against other cars while choosing certain parameters, e.g. car, number of rounds or the course. These courses and cars also have to be unlocked by beating missions. The same goes for the multiplayer.",

The eight case has to be unlocked by beating most of the others in the highest difficulty. The goals of the sections are varying, mostly the player has to win a race or stopping a criminal by crashing his car or thwarting him. Other goals are checkpoint races or tailing somebody. The story is told voiced texts between the sections or in voiceovers during the missions. If the player fails a section he can try it again instantly but he has to solve the whole case in one sitting.\n\nMost sections have additional goals which the player needs to fulfill, e.g. a time or damage limit. These restrictions change with the difficulty level which can be selected before each case.\nAfter every solved case the player unlocks new cars and courses for the single races and multiplayer mode. These don't represent the playing modes of the campaign but are always regular races.",

      "description": "<i>MX vs ATV Reflex</i> is the next installment of the off road racing series.\n\nThe game has been built from the ground up using a new physics engine and has a new control interface, known as \"reflex\", hence the title. As a result handling is improved, your freestyle tricks become easier to perform and you can use both of the controller's joysticks.\n\nAlso new to Reflex is terrain deformation which shapes the course throughout the race, resulting in tram lines forming, lumps of mud littering the course and some areas becoming smoother than others. As a result, your handling will vary, depending on what racing line you decide to take.\n\nOnline offers up to 12 player races, private games as well as public in the form of online or local system games. The competitive multiplayer game modes are tag and snake. In tag, one player is 'it' and the other players have to hunt him down, whoever gets him becomes 'it'. In snake, each player leaves a 'snake' behind them when they move. If anyone runs over these snakes, they are eliminated from the round. Other game modes included are waypoint races and a free ride mode.",

      "description": "<i>Cars: Race-O-Rama</i> is a racing game set in the Disney/Pixar Cars universe.  It is the third entry in a series of THQ licensed games that include Cars and Cars: Mater-National Championship .  The game includes a single-player story mode and an arcade mode.  In story mode, you progress through a series of races and mini-games with a series of cutscenes.  In arcade mode, you can replay story mode events and compete in 2-player split-screen races.\n\nThe plot of <i>Cars: Race-O-Rama</i> centers around Lightning McQueen as he trains students of the Doc Hudson Racing Academy to compete in the Race-O-Rama Circuit.  Soon, Lightning discovers that his arch-enemy, Chick Hicks, is training a rival group of racers who don't race by the rules.  Lightning must compete against these rival racers in an effort to win the Race-O-Rama trophy.\n\nStory mode uses an open-world format, where you can explore the world and play different events by driving to marked waypoints.  There are 7 different main explorable areas including Radiator Springs Stadium, Ornament Valley, Tailfin Pass, Radiator Springs, Santa Carburera, Autovia, and Motoropolis.  There are also 3 mini-games based on the Disney/Pixar animated short series \"Cars Toons\" that center around the character Mater.  These include \"Mater the Greater\", \"El Materdor\", and \"Tokyo Mater\".\n\nWhile racing, there is a boost meter that slowly fills over time.  Using the boost will give you a quick speed increase.  There is also a new drifting mechanic that allows you to take tighter turns and fill the boost meter more rapidly.  You can also jump in most races to avoid obstacles and other racers.\n\n",

      "description": "The easiest way to describe <i>Sonic & SEGA All-Stars Racing</i> would be to call it a Super Mario Kart clone. But instead of featuring famous Nintendo-characters like Mario and Bowser, the players use Sonic, Billy Hatcher, Dr. Eggman and 17 other more or less famous characters from the SEGA games library.\n\nThe core gameplay remains the same though: in a normal race the player has to compete against seven other racers using both his racing skills and one of the several different power ups that are scattered around the track like a boxing glove to shoot racers in front out of the way or mines to destroy his pursuers. Since all cars drive at the same speed, no matter which character they belong to, charging up the boost by doing drifts is the most important thing in order to get to first place. Tricks are also available to gain access to a turbo-boost. But the decision what racer and car to use does influence which All-Star-Action is available to the player. While Sonic the Hedgehog turns into Super Sonic for a short while, giving him a great amount of additional speed, Billy Hatcher lays egg-shells on the track to obstruct his followers. Like all other power-ups, the All-Star-Action has to be collected on the track first before it can be used.\n\nThe game features several different game-modes. In single player the player can either do time trials, single races, a Grand Prix or one of the several dozen missions that are available and require the player to fulfil many different goals other than simply being the first in a race. These goals include using one long drift to get to the finish line, roll over as many crows as possible or get to the finish line without destroying any pots and many more. \n\nMultiplayer consists of a split screen mode for up to four players and an online mode (not available in the PC-version). Besides normal races several battle modes are waiting like King of the Hill or simple Deathmatch. Completing a mission or winning a race either in single player or in multiplayer earns the player SEGA miles which are used in the internal shop to unlock additional characters and tracks.\n\nThe Xbox 360-release features in addition to the SEGA characters and tracks also Rare\u2019s Banjo-Kazooie - hence the additional subtitle.",

Unlike SimBin's PC racing games it features the new Lizard game engine. Race Pro is the company's first console game. Unlike a lot of current racing games, Race Pro features real life racing events that include the WTCC, Formula 3000 and Formula BMW, and feature tracks like Macau and Porto, as well as Laguna Seca in the US.\n\nAs with many other racing games, you will have driver assists to help you round the track, but this can be turned off completely if  unwanted. As well as the standard controller, you can also use all of the major force feedback controllers that are available for the 360. The majority of the people featured in Race Pro are real people, and features all the 2007 WTCC drivers as well as other famous drivers such as Tiff Needel and Tor Graves.\n\nMultiplayer allows you to take on 12 other players via either a system link or Xbox Live, over varying amounts of laps, which can be adjusted from 2 to 75 laps per race. Alternatively, you can have an offline game against several A.I. opponents.\n\nCars manufacturers include Seat, BMW, Alfa Romeo, Audi, Dodge and Chevrolet, as well as the F3000 car for the Formula 3000 racing events.",

Players build up their racer in career mode from 125cc bikes, advancing through the 250cc class, until finally achieving the prestigious MotoGP class.  In order to advance their racing career, players will have to upgrade their bike, hire staff, and attract sponsors.  A revamped arcade mode challenges users to race against the clock throughout a season to see how far they can get with a finite amount of time.\n\nThis is also a more accessible motorcycle game than past iterations with several features to help new users.  The game features a new 'second chance' ability where the player can rewind time to retry a challenging section of track.  Voiceover guides the player through the career, explaining options and giving racing tips.  A difficulty system has been implemented to provide the appropriate level of challenge.",

      "description": "<i>Trials HD</i> is a follow up of developer RedLynx's previous game Trials 2. New hazards in this edition include rolling steel balls, movable and breakable platforms, explosives, carts on rails, gymnastics-like even bars and elevators.\n\nPlayers control a stunt cyclist on a series of 35 linear 2-D tracks. In the standard mode, the player must guide their cyclist through tracks of increasing difficulty and improbability, with the only goal being to make it to the other side (with any stunt jumps or tricks simply being a way to pass obstacles).  12 extra \"stunt\" challenges have the player doing stunts for points or performing ridiculous feats like seeing how long they can ride atop a steel ball, or how many bones they can break by launching themselves down a mountain of shipping containers. Leaderboards track best times and points for all tracks on both game modes.\n\n<i>Trials HD</i>'s core gameplay is based around physics, which takes into account the rider's weight, speed, and the fact that any torque or traction is generated only by the bike's rear wheel. Jamming down on the throttle will likely result in the bike flipping over and crushing the rider.  Similarly, not distributing the rider's weight on a jump will make him land awkwardly and take a tumble. The game is thus less about racing, and more about control.\n\nUsing a combination of analogue throttle and brake (on the controller's triggers), the player must find exactly the right combinations, rider positions, and trick moves to pass each track.  Checkpoints are scattered throughout the track, usually before major trick sections. The game is designed around trial-and-error, and buttons instantly return the player to the last checkpoint or the start of the track after each fall; making it easy for players to get right back into the action.\n\nThe player is graded at the end of their run by time and the number of faults (restarts at checkpoints). Flawless runs are required to unlock gold medals, new tracks, and extra stunts. Unlocking medals also unlocks new bikes with different characteristics of speed and handling, whose appearance can be customized to a limited extent.\n\nAn edit mode further allows players to create their own tracks and share them with anyone in their friends list.",

      "description": "<i>Scrap Metal</i> is a top-down car-combat game in the vein of Death Rally with intensive use of weapons. It features a story-mode (with 60 missions) including boss fights as well as local multiplayer and Xbox Live online matches for up to 4 players. Additional cars and weapons can be unlocked throughout the story mode by wrecking opponents. This adds their cars to the player's junkyard. From there the player can select up to four cars to put in a car pool. Cars can be customized aesthetically, but also technically through upgrades paid for with points earned throughout the races. Cars are divided in different classes based on their statistics and sometimes a specific class of car needs to be used for a race. It is possible to put a car back in the junkyard and exchange it for another one previously collected.\n\nTracks feature shortcuts and jumps, and power-ups such as nitro boosts, health, repairs, and extreme firepower. All of the cars have a standard weapon, such as a machinegun, rocket launcher, shotgun or energy ray, as well as melee weapons such as blades or weapons used to push other cars out of the way. There are 20 different vehicles to choose from. The different types of missions include regular races, elimination races, derbies, and small arenas similar to those of Destruction Derby. There are also tracks where the player needs to escort another vehicle or target a specific enemy in a race.\n\nThe game offers two ways of controlling the cars. First, a directional steering sending the car in the very direction the analog stick is pointed at, and secondly a traditional left/right steering as one can find it in regular racing games.",

The main focus lies on the realistic simulation of the driving physics. During the season the player takes the role of one of 27 licensed athletes and compete in 13 of the race locations of the season 2008/2009 (the N\u00fcrburgring is not in available). There are up to eight sessions per race, including free training and warm ups. In the garage the player can tune almost every aspect of his bike in detail. Beginners this can be delegated to an engineer. Of course there is also the option to play just a single racing weekend or to start in a quick race. \n\nIn comparison to its predecessor there are two notable changes: driving helps for novice players and 20 challenges. In these the player either has to solve certain problems in pre-defined situations, e.g. winning the race with worn out brakes or reaching checkpoints in a limited time frame.",

      "description": "<i>Split/Second</i> is a TV show all about cars, destruction and explosions and they are always looking for new participants. For the twelve episodes of the new season, they hire the player to be one of the eighth drivers and perhaps even become the next champion. It is an arcade-focused racing game with fake-named sport cars inspired by real-world cars. But instead of just racing around the tracks and trying to be first just by driving better, everyone has access to a power play bar. By doing drifts, drafting (driving in the slipstream of another car), jumping or avoiding an activated power play, the three sections of the bar fill up. While the first two are used to activate two level one power plays, filling up the third gives the player access to a level two power play.\n\nIf a section of the bar is filled, the player will see an icon above the cars ahead once they are in range of a power play. These power plays are for example a helicopter who drops exploding barrels or a parked car rigged to explode, but also larger events like a train bridge that goes up in flames or a whole ship sliding to the side. While the first two are level one power plays, the second two are level two power plays. Activating a level two power play also results in a change of the track. Once the ship has been blown up the normal route is blocked by fire so the drivers have to use the deck of the ship as an alternate route. There are also often shortcuts on the track which are opened up by spending a level one power play and close a few seconds afterwards, crushing anyone who was foolish enough to follow the player (or whoever opened it up). The reason to use these power plays is simple: wrecking the opponent, either by letting him crash into things or shaking him up so much that he looses control of his car and crashes himself. Of course the player has to be careful. He too can be caught up in his own power play, losing his advantage and more often then not even the entire race. Much of the driving is centered around drifting through corners and carefully throttling to keep the drift going. Long drifts are also the fastest way to fill up the power play bar.\n\nBesides the normal races the game features several other game modes like Destruction in which the player has to get to the finish line as fast as possible while every power play on the track is automatically triggered. Air Strike on the other hand requires the player to dodge missiles shot by a helicopter flying ahead. The mode Air Revenge takes this even further, allowing the player to return those missiles to their origin. There are also Time Trial events where are all power play are triggered automatically and Elimination where the last driver of the pack is eliminated from the race after set time intervals.\n\nDuring the course of the campaign the player earns credits depending on which place he finished an event. By earning credits, the player automatically unlocks access to the final event of each episode, an elite race, and new cars. In addition the player unlocks special decals by doing crazy stuff like winning a race by a split-second. Each episode also features a bonus event which needs to be unlocked first by wrecking a certain amount of cars in the other events.\n\nOn all platforms the game features a split-screen-mode for two players as well as online multiplayer for up to eight players with three different game modes available.",

      "description": "<i>Blur</i> is an action-oriented racing game very similar to the Mario Kart series. But instead of driving on go-carts through colorful environments shooting bananas and turtle shells, the game features dozens of licensed sports-cars from several different manufacturers including the Audi Quattro, the Nissan 350Z and the Shelby GT-500 racing around fantasy and real-world tracks. \n\nScattered around these tracks are three different types of power-ups including a repair kit and a shield as well as five different weapons, like the target-seeking Shunt, which of course are used to get rid of the competition. To that end, each car is very unique in its statistics like strength, acceleration and such, making it a very tactical decision which one to use for the different types of races and tracks. The events include normal races with and without power-ups as well as pure destruction focused ones either taking place in specially build arenas or on normal race tracks.\n\nThe core of the game is the single-player campaign. Divided into nine groups and taking place at over 14 different real-world locations, the player has to make his way to the top. Each group includes several different events including a boss fight. If the player wins the latter, he earns their cars including the unique mods and finishing. To unlock new events and groups, the player has to earn lights - up to seven for each event. While he gets five lights for taking first place, the final two can only be obtained by pleasing the fans.\n\nEach event features a Fan Target and a Fan Run. Fan Runs are mini-challenges which are activated during a race and require the player to drive through a series of glowing arcs - while the normal race still continues. Besides a bonus light, this will also earn him additional fans. The rest of the fans which are needed to reach the Fan Target are \"collected\" by shooting and destroying other cars or by impressing with cool driving skills like making drifts or long jumps and such.\n\nThe game also offers a multiplayer mode for up to four players on one machine or up to 20 online. While offline multiplayer only allows the players to choose from all the available cars, online multiplayer offers unlockable car upgrades and mods. In addition the player advances in rank by winning events. Once he reaches level 50, he can choose to enter Legendary mode. Similar to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, the player then loses all his accomplishments and is reset to rank 1 but earns an exclusive Legendary car for doing so. This reset can be done up to ten times.",

      "description": "<i>SBK X</i> is the seventh iteration of the official videogame series accompanying the Superbike World Championship and based on the 2009 season. This time around the game not only features all the official tracks, drivers, motorcycles and sessions from the Superbike class but also introduces Supersport and Superstock 1000 into the mix. In addition the new Evolving Track feature is introduced. Thanks to this system, the track \"rubbers\" over time, revealing the best trajectories and allowing the player to enjoy better grip. The system also works for wet races. Here the track dries up faster where most of the riders drive, keeping the player on his toes with constantly changing circumstances. \n\nTo enjoy the new features, the player has the choice between Arcade and Simulation Mode at the start of the game:<ul><li>Arcade Mode: This mode allows for wheelies and break off beyond the limits without the fear of falling off. The core is the Story Mode in which the player starts out in the Superstock 1000, By gaining reputation points he'll slowly make his way up to the World Superbike Championship. Reputation points are earned by fulfilling the objects during each race. To that end, the races often don't start at the beginning. Instead the player e.g. has to make his way to the 10th place, starting from the 14th in only two rounds. </li><br>\n<li>Simulation Mode: Here, everything is about realism - even on the lowest setting. The core is the career mode. The player once again starts out in the Superstock 1000 and has 8 seasons to become the new Superbike World Champion. But instead of challenges and chapters, this is the real deal featuring complete races (including qualifying and warm-up), a very sensitive control scheme and tons of ways to change the settings on the motorcycle to best suit the needs of the track and the player</li></ul>Both modes require the player to create an individual rider by choosing his look, his outfit as well as his riding style and feature several quick-play-options. A multiplayer mode for up to 16 riders is also available sporting quick races, time attack as well as personalized single and team championships.",

      "description": "<i>BitStream</i> is a retro-style minimalist racing game that draws a heavy influence from Dotstream. The player controls a colored line which races against seven other colored lines. Moving straight and \"drafting\" next to other lines will increase speed, as will hitting boost pads strewn about each course; turning up and down the course, as well as hitting obstacles, will decrease speed. However, unlike <i>Dotstream</i>, hitting obstacles will not end the race prematurely.\n\nThere are four tournaments of four races each, as well as a single race mode, a \"freestyle\" mode where all eight lines can be controlled in time with the music, and a \"swarm\" mode where the player controls two lines simultaneously and must keep them going at the same pace. Up to eight players can race simultaneously.",
