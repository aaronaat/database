      "description": "A small bear and a small tiger live in their house by a river, minding their own business, when one day a crate is swept ashore from a place called Panama with nothing but bananas inside - the favorite food of the two.\n\nConvinced that this Panama must be some paradise just bursting with bananas, the two set off to find it. Play the tiger, with the bear providing needful advice. In this action/adventure, the player has to overcome obstacles, solve puzzles, and outsmart evil pirates who have their own plans with those two.\n\nBased on the world created by the German children's book author Janosch, this game aims at young children.",

The words you use can be added as favorites which can be easily reselected.

There are several variants on this gameplay.\n\nThere is a story mode featuring a family of archaeologists who are digging up Japanese orthography across the globe. Sweden, for instance, is known not only as being the home of lost Atlantis but also troves of buried Japanese writing!

The Japanese appliance company Jaguar designed a sewing machine called the JN-100, and later the JN-2000, which can be controlled via a Nintendo Game Boy Color. This cartridge was then released, containing various designs of Mario characters, enemies, and items,  which can be sewn as patterns using the Jaguar sewing machine.\n\nThe concept is similar to an earlier Mario game for the Famicom Disk System, <i>I am a Teacher: Super Mario Sweater</i>. A follow up was planned, <i>Jaguar Mishin Sashi Senyou Soft: Kirby Family</i>, but was cancelled.",

      "description": "<i>Blue's Clues: Blue's Alphabet Book</i> is an educational game for pre-schoolers based on the TV show with the same name. The game focuses on teaching young players spelling, letters and the alphabet through several games with simple controls and few button inputs.\n\nFrom the game's main menu the player can either play with Blue's alphabet book (which constitutes the full game), or play any of the games by selecting any of the friends hanging out in the same room.\n\nIn the full game, pages have gone missing in Blue's book, so Steve and Blue set out to play various games with their friends to find clues. After a certain amount of games have been played, pages are filled in with pictures for the letters. The pages can be played in any order.\n\n",
