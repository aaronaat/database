      "description": "<i>Golden Axe</i> is an arcade beat-'em-up game that puts players in the shoes of one of three heroes, each with his own reason for trying to overthrow the evil rule of Death-Adder, who - along with his forces of darkness - kidnapped and imprisoned the King and his daughter and stole the legendary Golden Axe.\n\nThis is a horizontal fighting game, where you basically take one of the three characters (the barbarian Ax Battler, a dwarf named Gilius Thunderhead or the amazon Tyris Flare) and bash everything which stands between you and Death Adder himself. Each character has a special magical ability that can be charged by kicking small blue creatures that drop a potion. There is also a green variety off this creature that drops food that replenishes your health. Some enemies ride dragons and a scorpion like creature. The enemies can be knocked off and you can mount the creature yourself and attack the enemies with it.\n\nThe game allows to play up to two players on a same screen, however in the C64 version this option has not been implemented. C64 version was also stripped off in the other areas, such as: only one enemy can engage the player at a time or there are only two types of dragons instead of three.",

It contains four pinball tables: Rock Fantasy, Medieval Knights, Urban Chaos, and Monkey Mayhem, each with a different theme. Compared to <i>Epic Pinball</i>, it has a larger, 320x400 resolution, as well as taller tables, both allowing for more objects. It also has a typical Dot Matrix Display where the scoreboard shows 3D-rendered animations as well. The controls are more sensitive with a faster ball. This is less true to real pinball gameplay, but it speeds up the game's pace and gives more power to the player to influence the movement.",

      "description": "<i>Wolfenstein 3D</i> is an episodic first-person shooter and a follow-up to the top-down infiltration game Castle Wolfenstein. The game puts the player in the boots of  B.J. Blazkowicz, an allied spy. There are six episodes: the first distributed complete as shareware; the second and the third available after registration; and the three final missions (which happen before the events of the first episode) available in the Nocturnal Missions pack. \n\nIn the first episode (Escape from Wolfenstein), B.J. is captured, but overpowers a guard with the help of a concealed knife and manages to get out of his cell. Throughout the next nine levels the player guides B.J. searching for an escape from Wolfenstein, guarded by Hans Grosse. After returning to Allied territory, B.J. is given the instructions to Operation: Eisenfaust, where he has to stop Dr. Schabbs and his army of mutant prototypes before they are released into the battlefields. The final mission (Die, F\u00fchrer, Die!) has a simple goal: infiltrate the bunker under the Reichstag, and terminate Hitler (in a robotic suit) himself.\n\nThe Nocturnal Missions are focused on the Nazi plans for chemical warfare, and start with Dark Secret, where B.J. hunts for lead researcher Dr. Otto Giftmacher. It's followed by Trail of the Madman, where the goal is capturing the war plans guarded by Gretel Grosse, and the final episode Confrontation, where B.J. meets General Fettgesicht, the planner for the chemical assault.\n\nEach episode has nine levels (eight regular and a final boss level), plus a secret level activated by an hidden switch somewhere in the eight first levels. Regular levels often feature a maze-like appearance or large areas with many enemies (the number of them on each area depends on the difficulty level), where the player must reach the exit elevator. To do so, he must kill the enemies (while it's possible to move behind the guards' backs and even there's a slight bonus in attacking them from behind, most enemies have to be dealt with by fire power), and depending on the level, activate \"push walls\" and/or get silver and golden keys to open certain doors.\n\nMany objects can be found in a level, from medikits, chicken meals, and even dog food (to restore health), ammo and treasures, which solely exist for points. There are four weapons (knife, pistol, machine gun and Gatling), all of them using the same bullets except the knife. The knife and the pistol are given at the start of the level, while the machine gun is either found (usually in secret areas) or picked up from SS troopers, and the Gatling is always dropped somewhere in the level. There are five kinds of enemies (excluding bosses) - Dogs (fast, but more a nuisance than life-threatening), Army Soldiers (dressed in regular brown outfit, not very powerful but usually found in large groups), Officers (dressed in white, armed with a very accurate pistol and tough to kill), SS Troopers (blue attire, armed with a machine gun and tough to kill), and Mutants (the rarest and toughest of regular enemies, pale-skinned troopers with green clothes and a machine gun stuck in their chest).\n\nThe player character has a number of lives; once he loses the last life, the game ends. To win extra lives, the player has to either find the 1-up item in the level or get 20,000 points (by killing enemies and capturing treasures or completing a level below the 'par' time while killing all enemies, finding all secrets by pushing walls, and collecting all treasure points).",

      "description": "Christopher Blair, \"Heart of the Tiger\" had retired to a farming planet after the war, content with retirement, so he says... In the depths of space, a new menace has surfaced. Some unknown attackers are killing civilian ships. The tension between the Confederation and the Border Worlds is at an all time high, as both sides accuse the other of staging the attacks. Admiral Tolwyn has recalled Blair back to service, where he will make the most difficult choice of all... And contemplate action he had never dared before, in the name of justice...\n\n<i>Wing Commander IV: The Price of Freedom</i> is a mix of interactive movie and space sim. The game has a dynamic mission tree, which means the player's behaviour will determine the next mission. The videos feature real actors, like Mark Hamill, Tom Wilson, John Rhys-Davies and Malcolm McDowell. Before the start of each mission, the space craft can be equipped with different weapons. Sometimes the mission objectives change during flight, and the player has to make decisions what he wants to do next, e.g. help out his friend or destroy an enemy fighter.",

Soon betrayed by her employer, Lara Croft travels to Greece, Rome and Egypt to recover the other parts before this powerful device falls into the wrong hands.\n\n<i>Tomb Raider</i> is a 3D action game with platforming and puzzle-solving elements, in which players control Lara Croft from a third-person perspective. The camera follows Lara as she climbs, jumps, and swims through detailed environs overcoming environmental obstacles and deadly fauna.  Moving through levels often involves finding spots where Lara can climb, looking for spots where Lara can use her acrobatic ability, and sliding blocks and pushing levers to solve puzzles and open passageways.\n\nLara is armed with twin pistols with infinite ammunition, but she can pick up higher caliber weapons to take on deadlier human opponents.  Lara also comes across restorative health packs and has a compass with which she can orient herself.  Lara\u2019s opponents include animals, gunmen, as well as primeval and supernatural beings.  Careful explorers can also find secret areas and avoid traps.",

      "description": "The Dagger of Xian is a legendary weapon that was used by Chinese emperors to command their armies. It is said that a person can turn into a dragon by piercing his own heart with this dagger. When one of the emperors used it for that purpose, Tibetan monks manage to withdraw the dagger from his heart and return it to its resting place on the Great Wall. While investigating the legend, the archaeologist Lara Croft finds out that a powerful Venetian crime lord is hunting for the dagger, and must do everything in her power to prevent him from obtaining it.\n\n<i>Tomb Raider II</i> is an action game with platforming and puzzle-solving elements, similar in concept and gameplay to its predecessor. Most of the gameplay consists of traversing hazardous 3D levels utilizing Lara's athletic skills and solving environmental puzzles. The sequel puts more emphasis on fighting enemies, adding many human foes to the mix. Additional weapons include a harpoon gun, a grenade launcher, and an M16 rifle. Automatic pistols replace the magnums from the first game.\n\nThere are two vehicles the player can drive in the game: a motorboat in Venice and a snow scooter in Tibet. Lara can now climb ladders and perform a roll in the air, landing in an opposite direction. The sequel also allows the player to save the game anywhere.",

      "description": "Kyle Katarn is a former Imperial officer turned mercenary, now hired by the Rebel Alliance. After having stolen the Death Star plans from a remote facility, he is tasked with investigating the sudden destruction of a hidden Rebel base. This leads him to face off against Imperial General Rom Mohc and the various iterations of his Dark Troopers - cybernetic soldiers with the armor and firepower to turn the tide of the war.\n\n<i>Dark Forces</i> is a close prequel to the original <i>Star Wars</i> movie trilogy. The game marks LucasArts' first attempt to enter the first-person shooter market. Instead of licensing the DOOM engine, like many competitors, LucasArts created its own internal Jedi engine. The Jedi engine contains advanced features over similar tech, including the ability to look up and down, jump, crouch, and limited support (in the build used for <i>Dark Forces</i>) for rooms (sectors) over rooms. The 3D models also make occasional appearances inside the game, as turrets or Kyle's ship dropping him off or picking him up from each mission. \n\nMost levels have a fairly complex, often maze-like structure, and include various switches that need to be activated to change the layout of the level. Jumping is integrated into the gameplay, as certain areas can only be accessed in that way. In addition to weapons, Kyle can use shields to protect himself from damage, a head lamp to illuminate dark areas, as well as specific items used to counter environmental hazards. The player character is given a certain amount of \"lives\" per level; he dies permanently once he runs out of all of them. Game progress can be saved only between missions.\n\nThe game features fourteen substantial levels as Kyle works to disarm the Dark Trooper project. Many levels reference characters or areas from the <i>Star Wars</i> movie trilogy, such as a visit with Jabba the Hutt, a trip to Coruscant, and a battle through the interior of a Star Destroyer. As opposed to most first-person shooters of the time period, every level has objectives for Kyle to complete, ranging from grabbing a clue and getting out alive, to planting charges around a facility to demolish it.  Cutscenes appear between key missions to update the plot.\n\nThe <i>Star Wars</i> license gets plenty of use, as the game features imperial officers, stormtroopers, and a collection of aliens seen in the films as enemies. Blaster rifles and thermal detonators are used as weapons, along with other firearms inspired by the tech of the films. <i>Dark Forces</i> also uses the iMuse engine to dynamically change the music during action scenes, with much of the music based off or directly replicating, John Williams' original film score.\n\nThe game is entirely a single-player campaign; no multiplayer is included or supported.",

These two sinister forces are battling for world domination. You must help them dominate the world across 60 violent missions spread through 30 cities - you receive e-mails containing the mission plans. \n\nAfter selecting a squad of four men from your roster, you direct them through the rotatable 3D city views, shooting foes as the situation dictates. Nuclear grenades and psycho gas are among the new weapons. Tubes, a monorail system and unimpeded Antigrav vehicles give a futuristic feel to travel. In the PC version, 8-player battles over modem and network are available.",

The amount of points you get depends on how you hit them ... e.g. you get more points for getting them do a 360 other than driving into theirs sides at high speed. The game has more to offer: a head to head mode with only two cars or the legendary destruction derby itself - a huge arena, every car starts at the edge of it, and then - have a nice crash!",

The tables are Partyland, Speed Devils, Billion Dollar Gameshow and Stones 'n' Bones, taking in a funfair, racing cars, a tacky game-show, and a graveyard. Each one has a range of ramps, combos, light sequences and targets to shoot, as well as general themes which are less influenced by real tables than those in Pinball Dreams. ",

      "description": "<i>Ghosts 'N Goblins</i> is a sideways scrolling action platformer spread over six levels, each of which must be completed within three minutes (or a life is lost), taking in forest, village, mountain and cavern settings with increasing difficulty.\n\nArthur the brave knight must rescue his beloved Princess from the Demon King Astaroth and his forces - amongst them are the various undead (ghosts, zombies), bats, ogres and goblins. Other challenges include moving platforms, ladders and water/fire hazards. \n\nThe player can walk left and right, jump, and is also equipped with a lance to use as a weapon. Getting hit by enemies causes Arthur to lose his armor and run around in his underpants, getting hit again will cause the player to lose a life. As in most games in this genre, the player can pick up power-ups such as daggers and bombs during the course of the game, giving the player greater firepower.",

There are 5 difficulty levels and optional credits, as well as the usual two player mode including same character duels.\n\nTo win the main tournament, the player must beat each of the other human players, before taking on Shang Tsung, Kintaro and finally Shao Kahn. Players have a range of punches and kicks available, as well as flying kicks, uppercuts, roundhouses, and the special moves, which vary for each player. These include throws, uppercuts, long-distance bullets, bicycle kicks and a teleport feature.",

      "description": "Abe is a Mudokon, a member of a once prosperous race which has now been enslaved by the Glukkons, forced to work in their huge corporations. The food factories have found a new type of meat, delicious to all the inhabitants, though no one knows the recipe. Following his stomach, Abe eavesdrops on the corporate leaders' conversation, and makes the most frightening and disgusting discovery: his own race is that secret delicious food. \n\nAlas, Abe has been spotted, and the guards are marching towards him. He must escape, but he can't leave his friends to the mercy of the Glukkons and their henchmen. He must rescue as many as he can, and tell the world the truth about what he has found out.\n\n<i>Abe's Oddysee</i> is the first game set in the fictional Oddworld universe. It is a platformer with puzzle-solving elements, focusing on the portrayal of a weak, underpowered character in a grim and hostile world, who has to rely on his cunning to outwit enemies and overcome hazards. Abe is almost completely helpless: he cannot use weapons and is usually instantly killed by his brutal enemies if he confronts them directly. For this reason, most of the game involves careful exploration, timed movement, sneaking, and outsmarting the foes through various means: throwing stones to confuse them, luring them into traps, etc. Abe can run, jump, climb, tiptoe, crouch, and roll; in most areas these actions are essential to his survival. A few stages involve Abe riding a large animal known as Elum.\n\nAbe's only special power is chanting, which he can use to stun certain enemies for a while or possess them. When Abe possess an enemy he gains his abilities: for example, possessing the body or a ferocious Slig allows the player to shoot from his machine gun, communicate with other creatures of his kind, and even commit suicide, clearing the way for Abe. \n\nChanting is also used to open \"bird portals\", which is the final action needed to bring a fellow Mudokon to safety. Before that, Abe needs to locate his enslaved friends and lead them out of the hostile environment by using a communication method called \"Gamespeak\". Gamespeak is a way of verbal communication through simple commands, which are assigned to various expressions, such as \"Hello\", \"Follow me\", \"Wait here\", etc. It can also be used to memorize passwords given to Abe by other Mudokons in a few areas. Many areas in which Abe can save Mudokons are hidden and not required to complete the game.  However, the ending of the game differs depending on the amount of Mudokons saved by the player. \n\nThe game has pre-rendered background graphics and uses CG movies of similar style to advance the story between the levels.",

      "description": "One year after after the first tournament Akira, Wolf, Pai, Jeffry, Kage, Jacky, Sarah and defending champion Lau are invited to the World Fighting Tournament, and are joined by the master of drunken Kung-Fu Shun-di, who wants to prove he's more than an old geezer and Lion Rafale, who's fighting for his freedom. Each fighter has his own style, from the lightning fast attacks of Pai to the powerful slams of Jeffry.\n\nHome port of Sega's popular Model 2A arcade vs. fighter released in 1995. Game modes include classic arcade mode, 2P vs mode, Expert mode (where the computer character progressively learns and counters players' technique), Ranking Mode (similar to Arcade, but at the end, a fighting style analysis is shown based on number of specials and time to knock down an opponent), Team Battle Mode (two teams composed of five fighters go against each other, the first to beat five characters being the winner) and Watch mode (allows choosing two fighters and then see them fighting). Both VF2 and VF2.1 (a tweaked version available only in Japan) modes are included. Gameplay keeps the same style from the first game, adding more moves to each fighters' roll. Using a three-key layout (block, kick and punch, being possible to assign button combinations to the extra keys) the player is able to control their fighter, aiming to knock or push the opponent outside the rink inside the time limit. Combo moves range from the quickest, which require the player to push up to five buttons quickly, to strong moves that require more button presses along d-pad nudges to be successful. As with the previous game, fighting is realistic (except the physics-defying leaps), and each fighter has nothing but their body to harm the opponent.\n\nWhile in comparison with the arcade version some parts took a hit on graphical quality (such as the texture details and backgrounds), the game uses the Saturn High-Resolution mode and flowing 60-fps  to bring the arcade experience home.",

This remake keeps some of the original game's shooter-style gameplay while mixing in more console-style exploration.  Gameplay progresses through five \"worlds\":  Weedom, Frostonia, Infernium, Enigma, and Evile.  Players blast away at the classic centipedes, spiders, fleas, and scorpions while fighting new enemies like the mosquito, cockroach, and killer mushroom.  A \"classic\" mode is also included, which allows players to play the classic game in a new \"3D\" isometric perspective.",

It features two forms of weapon upgrades and two types of missiles (normal or homing).

      "description": "The intrepid archaeologist Lara Croft ventures to India, searching for a legendary stone that once belonged to the tribe of Infada. Shortly after recovering the precious stone, she encounters a Dr. Willard, the head of an organization known as RX Tech. Willard is interested in an ancient Polynesian city built by people of a now defunct civilization, which worshipped a mysterious meteorite that hit the Earth millions of years ago. Willard tells Lara that the Infada Stone is in fact one of the four artifacts the ancient Polynesians fashioned from the material contained in the meteorite's core. Willard suggests Lara should look for the other three, scattered and hidden in various regions of the planet. It looks like another dangerous adventure awaits the fearless \"tomb raider\"!\n\n<i>Tomb Raider III: Adventures of Lara Croft</i> is an action game with platforming and  puzzle-solving elements. The gameplay system is similar to the one implemented in the previous game. Lara's abilities include running, jumping, climbing, swimming, rolling, crouching, crawling, sprinting, and swinging on bars and vines. A few new types of hazards have been added in this installment, including cold water in which Lara can swim for a limited amount of time, dangerous underwater creatures (such as piranhas), and the treacherous quicksand, which will swallow the heroine if the player isn't careful and fast enough to prevent her from falling into it.\n\nAs in the previous game, Lara uses pistols, shotguns, harpoon guns, uzis, and grenade launchers to defend herself. New weapons include the Desert Eagle, MP5 sub-machine-gun, and rocket launcher. A few levels are designed in such a way that sneaking becomes the preferable solution, rather than directly engaging the enemies in combat. Unlike the previous games, the player can choose to tackle the levels in any order following the introductory Indian scenario.\n\nThe player can save the game at any time in both the PC and the PlayStation versions; however, in the latter the amount of times the player can save the game depends on the amount of special crystals collected by Lara during her journey.",

In a race against time, Lara must use all of her wit and skill to reimprison Set and save the world from Armageddon. Pursued at every turn by her arch-rival, the unscrupulous archaeologist Werner Von Croy, Lara embarks on a journey of discovery across Egypt, where she must overcome the most ingenious puzzles and infernal traps ever devised, and face terrifying evil from beyond the grave...\n\n<i>Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation</i> plays very similar to the previous games in the series, but some new things have been added to the game. The biggest addition is that now rather large parts of the game consist of several interconnected levels sometimes explored in any order, with puzzles in one level often requiring that some actions are done in other levels. The new additions to Lara's arsenal are a revolver and a bow with several sets of arrows including exploding and poisonous ones. The players will also find a laser sight which can be attached to any of the two weapons described above allowing manual targeting and zooming. Inventory now holds a binocular with built-in flashlight and a handy crowbar (found later in the game). Lara has also learned a few new moves: she can climb into the niches with low ceiling if the crouch button is pressed, she can now move around the corners while hanging and she can also pull levers and open trap-doors while jumping. \n\nGraphics have been upgraded too - there are new light effects and water is now dripping from Lara's clothes when she gets on surface.",

      "description": "One thousand five hundred years after the events of Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain, the vampire Kain's decision at the end of that game has finally defeated the human kingdoms and brought the world of Nosgoth under his control. Ruling from a castle built on the Pillars of Nosgoth, Kain has established an empire of six vampire clans, each ruled by a lieutenant, the sons of Kain. Raziel was one such lieutenant, but lost his position through the insolence of receiving a new evolutionary \"dark gift\", the growth of feathery wings, before his master had acquired it. Fearing that Raziel might one day surpass him, Kain tears off Raziel's wings in a fit of range and banishes him into the Abyss. There, Raziel is lost in time, dead and his body consumed. The Elder God recovers Raziel's soul and rebuilds the broken body, not as a living vampire, but as a strange new creature of the underworld. Swearing revenge on Kain, Raziel now phases seamlessly between Nosgoth and its underworld, using his new powers to become a terrible reaver of souls...\n\n<i>Soul Reaver</i> is a third-person perspective action game with puzzle-solving and some platforming elements. The game follows Raziel on his quest to purge the land of vampires and take revenge on Kain and his brothers, leaders of the six clans. The player views the environments from behind Raziel's shoulder, moving him in any direction, climbing, attacking, jumping and using specific abilities. Raziel's can grip onto the edge of ledges and his torn wings allow him to glide gently downwards. He can also shift through the material world into the spectral realm at will, but must find specific locations in order to shift back. The two realms mirror one another, with distortions which give access to new areas and platforms. Existing in the material world drains Raziel's life energy at a constant rate.  \n\nThroughout the game, energy is recovered by consuming the souls of defeated enemies. If Raziel is able to defeat one of his brothers, he will additionally gain a new ability (\"dark gift\") upon drinking his soul. Examples include: the ability to swim, file telekinetic projectiles, or the ability to phase through locked gates. Raziel can arm himself with a variety of weapons including spears, daggers, swords, axes, as well as attacking enemies barehanded. Eventually, he will also come across Kain's personal sword (named the Soul Reaver), and will use it to create a powerful energy blade weapon.\n\nThe world is left open to Raziel, he can return to areas previously completed and explore the world of Nosgoth at will. Access to certain areas however sometimes  requires the use of gained specific abilities. Many of the puzzles the player will need to solve in this quest are block puzzles, requiring the placement of certain large structures (usually square blocks), either to activate switches or to build access to out-of-reach areas.",

      "description": "<i>Mega Man 3</i> is a traditional side-scrolling platformer: you jump from brick to brick while avoiding pits and shooting robots. It's quite similar, in all respects, to other Mega Man games; however, this is the first time that you get a sidekick. It's also the first time you're allowed to slide instead of merely walking. \n\nRush is your dog who helps out by offering other modes of transportation when you need it. He starts out with the 'Rush Coil' ability to launch you to the top of the screen like a springboard; later he acquires the 'Rush Jet' ability to turn into a guided, floating platform to carry you wherever you need to go; and he also gets the 'Rush Marine' ability which is a submarine that works just like the jet except underwater and with the added ability to hop around out of the water (you can actually jump while on the jet but the jet continues to hover beneath you whereas you stay inside the submarine). All of these abilities function just like boss weapons.\n\nWhen you defeat the boss at the end of a level you gain his power - or at least a similar power. You may pause the game at any time and switch to any single power you have. It supplants your regular Arm Cannon with a limited - but superior - ability. The weapon ammo is displayed next to your energy meter. There are eight of these, corresponding to the eight main levels, even though there are twenty-one levels in the entire game. \n\nEnemies will often supply you with both energy and ammo refills. You can also collect Energy Tanks which can only be used once but will entirely restore your health. You start the game with three lives. Other features include Surprise Boxes lying around for you to find. There are infinite continues and a password feature to resume play at the beginning of any level.",

March through the rivers, swamps and forests to overthrow the dictator (specified as Batista in Japan) in this evolution of the Commando style.\n\nThe game scrolls vertically, as you move up the screen shooting enemies, finding good strategic firing points and collecting powerups. As the enemy soldiers come towards you in groups, some care is required when picking them off, either using your gun or the grenades. There are also hostages carried by some soldiers, with points bonuses for not shooting these but shooting their captors. Each level ends with a boss.",

Some are wandering around in the open, while others have picked out hiding places, which you must approach from certain angles. Trees, rivers and bridges create a varied combat-like terrain and must be incorporated into your thinking. Extra grenades can be collected, and will definitely be required, as they allow you to kill from distance and thus avoid some enemy shots.",

      "description": "Some time during the 2050's, the world is a dangerous place as terrorists, drug czars, and outlaw states rule, using violence and subterfuge as tools in their push for global conquest. A deadly virus dubbed \"gray death\" is running rampant throughout the world and the only known cure is a chemical known as \"Ambrosia\" manufactured by the VersaLife corporation. However Ambrosia supplies are scarce and world governments, particularly the United States, carefully monitor and control who receives this cure. As protest against these events, French terrorist organization \"Silhouette\" bombs the historic symbol of friendship between French and American people, The Statue of Liberty. In response to this attack, the United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition (UNATCO) organization is formed. Building a headquarters underground at Liberty Island, its mission is to attack terrorism and maintain peace around the world. JC Denton is a nano-enhanced agent who has been primed for UNATCO service. While JC's brother Paul is already an active agent, JC is beginning his first day of service when the National Secessionist Forces (NSF) suddenly raid a supply of Ambrosia at UNATCO headquarters.\n\n<i>Deus Ex</i> is a dark cyberpunk game that combines gameplay styles of first-person shooter and RPG, with elements of stealth and puzzle-solving. The player assumes the role of JC Denton, UNATCO anti-terrorist agent. Pitted against an elaborate global conspiracy, he must interact with characters, pick up weapons and complete objectives. While JC is essentially fixed within the mission-framework of the game, he can be customized in areas such as weapons, technical skills and physical prowess. Completing objectives rewards the player with skill points, which may be distributed to increase JC's proficiencies in eleven different disciplines. The player can choose to increase the damage JC inflicts with various types of weapons, improve his lock-picking or computer hacking abilities, etc. Each such discipline has four levels of proficiency.\n\nAnother way of customizing JC is applying nano-augmentations to his body. These cybernetic implants bestow the hero with super-human abilities, and can be installed on different body parts, up to nine at the same time. Along with combat-related benefits, nano-augmentations also grant DC abilities that can be used to overcome certain obstacles within the game world. Examples of those are jumping to extreme heights, swimming, lifting heavy objects, etc. Weapons can be customized as well: their range, accuracy, and magazine sizes can be increased, and they can be enhanced by attaching scopes, silencers, or laser sights to them.\n\nThe game leads JC to various places all around the globe. The cities he visits, as well as most mission areas, are expansive and fairly open to accommodate different approaches to solving the same problems, depending on the player's preferred style of play. Most of the missions can be tackled in various ways, e.g. with brute force, stealth, or extensive usage of lock-picking and computer hacking abilities. At certain points, the course of the storyline can also be influenced by the decisions made by the player. Similarly to System Shock games, the environment is largely interactive, the player being able to pick up, use, and discard various types of objects.",

      "description": "Waylon Smithers has just stolen a diamond from Springfield Jewelers for Mr. Burns. While trying to make a getaway, he crashes into Homer, which knocks the diamond out of his hand. Maggie catches it in her mouth, prompting Smithers to grab her and run off. The Simpsons decide to go after him, but Mr. Burns has tons of henchmen, who want to prevent the family getting their daughter back.\n\n<i>The Simpsons</i> is basically a side-scrolling beat-em-up featuring the characters from <i>The Simpsons</i> TV show. The player can choose to play as each of the four Simpson characters. Homer, who punches and kicks; Marge, who swings her vacuum cleaner; Bart, who wields his skateboard; and Lisa, who uses a jump rope as a whip. Other weapons such as hammers and bowling balls are also available to use. The game's levels are Downtown Springfield, Krustyland, Springfield Discount Cemetery, Moe's Tavern, Springfield Gorge, Dreamland, the Channel 6 studio, and the Power Plant. Each level ends with a boss whose speed and strength will increase after taking a certain amount of damage. End level bosses are the wrestler Professor Werner von Brawn, a hot air balloon shaped like Krusty the Clown, a pair of bouncers, a drunk at Moe's Tavern, a henchman in a bear suit, an imaginary, gigantic bowling ball, and a martial arts sensei dressed like a kabuki actor. There's also the showdown finale against Smithers and Mr. Burns in a robotic outfit.\n\nBetween levels, the player can compete against the other characters in two mini-games to be first to complete a task (inflating a ballon and waking up their character).",

Rayman has been captured by the pirates as well and is lamenting his troubles in his prison cell, when he meets his good friend, Globox.  Globox has smuggled in a silver Lum, given to him by the great fairy, Ly.  With the power of the silver Lum, Rayman is able to once more shoot his fists.  With his power restored, the pair escape the flying prison ship and embark on another adventure to save the entire world!\n\n<i>Rayman 2: The Great Escape</i> is the sequel to Rayman, a 2D side-scrolling platform game.  Unlike the previous game, <i>Rayman 2</i> is entirely in free-roaming 3D environments, similar to Super Mario 64.  Rayman has many unique abilities that can help him get around the world.  In addition to being able to shoot his fists, he can use his hair to hover like a helicopter, and even glide on air currents in certain places.  He can climb certain walls and ceilings and can even use his fists to swing from special purple Lums which are shaped like rings.  Rayman also has many unique items at his disposal, such as powder kegs which can be carried or fly like jets, strange warheads with legs that he can ride and steer like bucking mules, and gigantic plums that can be thrown into the water to create new paths.\n\nRayman's goal is to find the four masks of the world, which allow the owner to reawaken Polokus, the spirit of the world.  These masks are scattered far and wide, and are well hidden and guarded, so it is not an easy task.  By gathering the yellow Lums, Rayman will gain access to new worlds, which will take him to the locations of new masks.  Collecting yellow Lums also rewards him with new powers and life meter extensions.",

Kain is returned in the form of a vampire and yearns to exact vengeance on those who had killed him. Stronger and faster than a human being, coupled with a thirst for blood that must be satisfied regularly, he is able to dispatch his killers quickly. However, Mortanius and other forces seek to use him a tool in a greater plot. Mortanius is of the Circle of Nine, the guardians of the Pillars of Nosgoth. These pillars, the center of the world and balancing the forces, have become corrupted and the Circle members been driven mad. At the Pillars, Kain meet Ariel - a former guardian of the the Pillar of Balance, now a spirit after being murdered by an unseen assailant. She informs Kain of his relation to the Pillars and that the only way for him to restore the balance is to seek out each guardian and kill them. The fate of Nosgoth may hang on Kain decisions.\n\n<i>Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain</i> is a top-down game where the player controls the vampiric Kain. As a vampire, Kain is able to withstand sunlight, but is harmed by water. However, he is able to obtain several cursed abilities and spells such as being able to transform into a bat, wolf, and even a cloud mist respectively, as well as learning the ability to disguise himself from creatures of weaker mind. Kain is also fixated on murder and is a master of several ways to kill and destroy his opponents. As the enemies are slain in front of him, Kain may drink their blood to restore his health, which is always trickling away, representative of his insatiable craving. To aid in the slaughter of his enemies, Kain may equip different weapons and armor, each with its own unique properties.",

      "description": "<i>Carnivores 2</i> is a hunting simulation in the vein of Deer Hunter. Instead of hunting cute woodland creatures however the player gets to hunt big, hungry dinosaurs. The story is set in the far future and mankind has mastered galactic travel. On a distant watery planet we discover species completely identical to Earth's ancient dinosaurs living quite happily on a series of lush islands. Being the enlightened galaxy-spanning species that we are, we decide to bring in a bunch of big-game hunters to blow their brains out and bring em' home stuffed and mounted.\n\nIn the PC version there is a total of nine huntable dinosaurs, as well as several additional species which serve to populate the environment. The latter can be shot too, but they are not rewarded with kill trophies. The game is set in an open environment played from a first-person perspective. The dinosaur-hunting company has provided a gun, a map, some binoculars, a \"dinosaur call whistle\"  and a license to kill things. The player travels through woods, climbs mountains, and even picks through the decrepit remains of deserted research outposts in the search for the next kill. The game requires a tactical approach. Dinosaurs have keen hearing, sight, and smell and will run away if they detect the presence of a hunter. Often a downwind approach is needed, and the hunter needs to hide behind a rock or tree, and uses a mating call to lure them in for the perfect shot. Of course the highlight of the game is the challenge in hunting hunters, the carnivores.\n\nCarnivores will stalk the hunter whether he is hunting them or he is just passing through their territory. The whistle's herbivore mating call or the sound of gunfire may inadvertedly alert them to the hunter's presence and location. Instead of charging head-on into the waiting maw of the shotgun, they can circle through the underbrush, dodging out of sight and ambushing from the sides. Despite their aggressiveness they are not stupid. If the hunter camps out in a clearing on top of a hill with a sniper rifle they will stay in the woods instead of charging out into the open where a clear shot is much easier. The exception to this is the huge Tyrannosaurus, who are disdainful of the puny bullets and will simply charge like an oncoming freight train.\n\nThe hunter starts in the woods with a pistol stalking herbivores. Each killed dinosaur earns points which can be spent on better weapons (six in total), new areas such as marshlands and deserts, or the right to hunt a larger selection of dinosaurs including carnivores. The more expensive dinosaurs get fiercer and bigger, and eventually enough points will be earned for the privilege of challenging the T-Rex.\n\nThe iOS, Android and Mini versions are enhanced ports of the original game. Next to the updated graphics it adds the Pachycephalosaurus, Amargasaurus, Oviraptor, Utahraptor, and Troodon as new dinosaurs and Ravaren's Bridge from Carnivores: Ice Age as a new map. From that game also comes the supply ship that picks up the corpses and a photo camera to take pictures of the animals in an exploration-type game mode free of blood. A relocate option allows the hunter to start at a new location during a single hunt. It can be used multiple times and also refreshes the supplies. Next to the the original Hunt mode these versions add a Survive mode where the hunter needs to stay alive as long as possible. The wind locator has been moved inside the compass to make more room on the screen. Most of the new content was not available right away, but added in gradually through updates. The hunter is controlled through a virtual d-pad on the left side of the screen and on the right side two icons can be tapped quickly to call an animal or to draw a gun and aim. For Android an iOS there is a free-to-play version with microtransactions. In the Android version two additional bundles can be purchased to expand the game and access everything, while for iOS there is a separate commercial app with everything unlocked.",

He gets a lot of money and an agent suit for that. The game generally resolves around a James Bondish spy theme, but the story is not referenced later in the game.\n\nGex has to enter levels through TVs to collect three types of remote controls in order to unlock more of the Media Dimension, boss levels and secret TVs. Gex can tailwhip or karate-kick his enemies, climb certain walls and ceilings, eat bugs for power-ups, and spout one-liner wisecrack jokes. The gameplay is non-linear, the player can choose from multiple routes and goals on each level, and are replayable anytime after accomplished. \n",

      "description": "<i>Metal Gear Solid</i> is a sequel to Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake. After the tragic confrontation with Big Boss, the hero, special agent Solid Snake, decided to retire and has since then lived in a secluded region in Alaska. But the US government recruits him once again for a dangerous mission. The members of Foxhound, a renegade special forces unit, threaten to use a devastating nuclear weapon if the government doesn't hand them the mortal remains of Big Boss, their former commander. Foxhound is now led by a talented, ambitious young man with the codename Liquid Snake. Knowing that the visual resemblance between this new terrorist mastermind and himself can not be coincidental, Solid Snake agrees to infiltrate the new Foxhound base, destroy the unknown nuclear weapon, and find the truth about his own identity.\n\nThe gameplay in <i>Metal Gear Solid</i> follows the prototype established in the two earlier <i>Metal Gear</i> games. Solid Snake has a limited arsenal of weapons and cannot allow himself to pave his way to the goal by killing all the enemies. He has to stay unnoticed, hide, crawl, wait for the right moment, sneak, and use various gadgets that will prevent him from alerting the enemy. Boss battles and some other sequences are played out as action-oriented set pieces, with the player having to figure out the weakness of the enemy in order to succeed. \n\nThe game utilizes traditional top-down view, but the graphics in this installment are real 3D. Conversations with Snake's allies and cutscenes are used extensively to advance the plot and gain more insight into it. ",

The government that funded his research wrote the whole affair off as a loss, which made it all the more upsetting when reports of Dr. Kirk's good health and nearly finished research came in. A special forces team is sent to the doctor's private island laboratory to extract him and his research, but they are totally unprepared for some of the side effects of his developments. Side effects that come from 100 million years in the past.\n\n<i>Dino Crisis</i> is a survival horror game that is very similar in both control and gameplay to its sister series, Resident Evil. As in that series, protagonist Regina will have limited supplies and ammo with which to fight deadly enemies while searching rooms for keys (some figurative, some literal) to open locked areas. Unlike <i>Resident Evil</i> games, Regina will find very few actual supplies laying around, and will instead find \"plugs\" that are used to open caches of emergency supplies located around the complex. There are only enough plugs to open some of these caches, however, so care must be taken to decide what items are really needed. In another change from <i>Resident Evil</i>, the game is rendered in 3D, allowing the camera to rotate or pan, although camera angles are still out of the control of the player. Even the dumbest dinosaur is smarter than the undead, and enemies can chase and disarm Regina, and even occasionally follow her through doors. Regina can use the force fields in the complex to block her enemies.",

Her close friends begin to recollect her previous adventures, which occurred during different periods of her life. These include searching for the Philosopher's Stone in Rome; preventing the Spear of Destiny from falling into the hands of a ruthless gang leader; facing monsters on the Black Isle of Ireland as a child; and, finally, infiltrating a high-tech complex in pursuit of the Iris artefact.\n\nLike its predecessors, <i>Tomb Raider: Chronicles</i> is an action game with puzzle-solving and platforming elements. The gameplay is very similar to that of the previous games, with the addition of a few new skills. Lara can now walk on tightropes, swing on horizontal bars, and somersault forwards from a ledge while crouching. A grappling hook has been added to her inventory. The game also includes a level editor, allowing the player to create new stages for Lara to explore.",

But Rupture farms was just the beginning; the Glukkons are digging up bones at the ancient Mudokon burial grounds. They use the bones to make Soul Storm Brew. Abe must travel to the Soul Storm Brewery, stop those corporate villains and save the enslaved Mudokon workers.\n\n<i>Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus</i> is a 2D platform game very similar to its predecessor both visually and gameplay-wise. Like in the previous game, Abe has to outsmart his foes and avoid obstacles rather than confront them directly. The game is larger than its predecessor and is more oriented towards puzzle-solving, featuring more complex interaction with the Mudokons, who can now be angry, wired, depressed, sick, or blind. The first three problematic conditions can be removed with the appropriate \"Gamespeak\" command; sick Mudokons must be cured with a special item, while blind ones will follow Abe's voice and may fall to their deaths if Abe doesn't stop them in time.\n\nAn additional ability Abe has is turning into a Mudokon deity called Shrykull, which possesses the power to instantly kill enemies. Transformation into Shrykull is possible only if Abe succeeds in sending several Mudokons through the bird portal at the same time. After having used Shrykull's power once, Abe transforms back into his normal Mudokon self. \n\nAs opposed to the predecessor with its limited saving possibilities, a quick save feature has been added to <i>Abe's Exoddus</i>. The player can save at any time and resume playing from the same spot in case Abe dies.",

      "description": "<i>Carnivores: Ice Age</i> is third game in the hunting series. This version is set on the Arctic regions of planet FMM UV-32. Scientists of DinoHunt Corp. discovered that animals from the Ice Age still live there and they establish a hunting program. The player roams the planet using a mini-map, a compass and an assortment of guns to hunt down the animals. Unlike the previous PC games this title does not feature any dinosaurs (except for the prehistoric bird diatryma). The game uses the same engine as the previous titles and has five main areas: McRath Island, Ravaren's Bridge, Ring of Infernus, Dry Nodus Lake, and The Giant's Boot\u2014each with their own difficulty level. Just like the previous games animals do not leave behind tracks, despite the snow. The available weapons are largely identical to the earlier versions and include a a pistol, shotgun, rifle, crossbow, double-barreled shotgun, and sniper rifle. The included animals in the PC version are brontotherium, dire wolf, wild boar, woolly rhinoceros, diatryma, giant deer, smilodon (sabre-tooth tiger), woolly mammoth, cave bear, yeti, archaeopteryx, and the pig.\n\nThere are no missions in the game. The player selects what to hunt and the weapon, and then enters an area. It is always possible to leave as well. During the game points need to be earned. They are spent to customize hunts, as certain weapons, areas and animals cost more. Initially, only weaker animals (herbivores) and weapons are available until a sufficient amount of points has been earned. All animals are however able to kill the hunter. As in the previous games tranquilizers can be used instead of bullets, but these do not lead to trophies for kills. Points can also be spent on camouflage, a radar, or to cover scent. Hunting is done with a realistic approach as the animals need to be called to lure them and the player has to position himself against the wind, avoid noises and stay out of sight. The areas are open-ended and once again have a day-and-night cycle. A difference compared to the previous games is that here the weak points of the animals are not shown and they are generally more resistant to damage. \n\nThe enhanced iOS version features ten animals. The hunter is controlled through a virtual d-pad on the left side of the screen and on the right side two icons can be tapped quickly to call an animal or to draw a gun and aim. It also includes the ability to relocate to another place once inside a hunt. This can be done more than once and also refreshes the supplies. The Survive training exercise mode from the previous iOS game is not present. The iOS edition has a free-to-play version where additional animals, weapons and areas need to be bought through in-game purchases, next to a commercial release where everything is unlocked. In the PS3/PSP mini version the killing animations were toned down and corpses disappear instead of being picked up by a dropship.",

Smash enemies into the sides of frames, rip through the paper to unleash a super move and otherwise wreck havoc throughout the limitations of the graphic novel. Sketch himself can jump, attack and use various items that he finds along the comic book, including his rat friend, Roadkill. Button combinations can be used to unleash powerful techniques.\n\nThe game progresses linearly through each page of the comic book, however secret paths and alternate routes through the story can be discovered. At the end of each level, Sketch receives a super hero rating for how well he's progressing.",

      "description": "<i>Resident Evil 3</i> takes place during the events of Resident Evil 2. The midwestern town of Raccoon City is in ruins, having been overrun with the undead creating T-virus thanks to the wacky hijinks of William Birkin and Umbrella Inc. The player must guide Jill \"master of unlocking\" Valentine (one of the two main protagonists of the original <moby search=\"\n4976219154468\">Resident Evil) out of the city alive. Along the way, Jill will interact with and receive help from (or hindered by) three Umbrella mercenaries who are also stranded in Raccoon City. Standing in the way of your group's last escape are a horde of flesh-eating zombified citizens, homicidal mutants, and a relentless killing machine known only as Nemesis who is determined to hunt down and kill the survivors of the original <i>Resident Evil</i>, including Jill.\n\nA dramatic improvement over Tyrant/Mr. X/G from the previous games, Nemesis can run (faster than Jill, in fact), use firearms (a rocket launcher), dodge attacks, and even move through doors and from room to room in pursuit of Jill. On top of that he still possesses the nigh indestructibility we've come to know from Umbrella's ultimate bio-weapons. \n\nLike its two predecessors <i>Resident Evil 3</i> is a third-person action-adventure game with polygonal characters on pre-rendered backgrounds with cinematic camera angles, a technique originally pioneered by Alone in the Dark. Although the game uses the same basic engine and gameplay as the previous games, the gameplay is improved by features such as auto-targeting, a 180 degree spin, and a new dodge move that allows Jill to avoid enemy attacks. Another addition is Jill's ability to create different kinds of ammunition by mixing together three different types of gunpowder found throughout the game. The game include a randomization feature, which changes the location of certain key items and ammo. Another noteworthy feature is that at certain points in the game, Jill is faced with two choices for a situation, each will affect later story, and even the game ending. The zombies have also been made more diverse.\n\nThe number of polygons in the character models has also been increased, along with the possible screen resolution and color depth for the PC version (up to 1600 X 1200 at 32 bits, from a maximum of 640 X 480 at 16 bits for <i>Resident Evil 2</i>). Another addition in the PC version is the ability to skip cutscenes as well as the door loading animation.\n\nThe PC and Dreamcast versions includes all eight of Jill's possible costumes, as well as the mercenary mini-game Operation Mad Jackal which allows you to play as one of the three Umbrella soldiers. On the Playstation version, these special features must be unlocked by beating the game with a high score.",

      "description": "In a world covered almost entirely in water, there exist small islands that hide huge treasures. And where there's treasure, you can find treasure hunters called Diggers, who live for the thrill of the hunt...\n\nBarrel Casket was once one of the greatest Diggers, but he has now retired. He now cares for his young granddaughter, Roll, whose parents disappeared while on a dig. He had also discovered a strange baby boy in some ruins one time, who he also took under his care alongside Roll. He named the baby boy Rock Voulnut, and Rock grew up to be an expert Digger, sometimes known by his nickname, MegaMan.\n\nWhile out exploring one day, Rock, Roll, and Barrel's airship, the Flutter, crash lands on an island named Kattelox. As they explore Kattelox in hopes of fixing their ship, they hear word of a huge treasure, the legendary Mother Lode, that is buried somewhere on the island. Rock, Roll, and Barrel decide to look for the treasure, but at the same time, they're going to get a little competition from a pirate family named the Bonnes...\n\n<i>Mega Man Legends</i> is the first of the <i>Mega Man</i> series to take place in fully explorable 3D, and is paced more like an RPG than the previous stage-to-stage action games. Rock can explore the town and follow the story to find entrances to the underground ruins, where in he will find traps, feral Reaverbots, and large boss robots. Destroying enemies will reward Rock with health, sub-weapon energy, and the power cores of the robots, which people in his world use as currency. By searching through the town and ruins Rock will find items of dubious use and value, and they can be brought back to Roll to be assembled into useful items and upgradable sub-weapons, although not for free. Rock can run while shooting, go into first person mode for aimed shots, and also lock onto an enemy and circle around them to avoid their attacks.",

      "description": "The young sorceress Nikki, the court jester Fargus, and his side-kick Sid the puppet are the three main protagonists of this 3D platform game. While attending a \"Wizards in Training\" seminar, Nikki accidentally casts a powerful magic spell, which results in a giant monsters swallowing the whole village. The three friends must now travel to a place called \"Wishing Engine\", and be granted a wish to revert the world back to normal.\n\nThe characters each have a special movement to kill enemies with. The game uses floating camera angles through a vast Prince of Persia-style world. The goal of the game is to clear the various levels, avoiding spikes and enemies and collecting coins for extra lives.\n\nUnlike most 3D platformers, <i>Pandemonium</i> offers only two-dimensional movement, rather than complete freedom of movement. The characters move along a curving 2D course within a 3D environment.",

      "description": "Yet again Sonic and friends find themselves wrapped up in the schemes of Dr. Robotnik. This time he plans to exploit the power of Chaos, a malevolent being that feeds upon the power of the Chaos Emeralds. In their own ways five heroes will do what they can to save Station Square and, perhaps, the entire world.\n\nThe player can select from which character to play after meeting them with Sonic, and each has their own unique version of each level. Sonic's levels involve racing through a level as quickly as possible, destroying any robots along the way. Tails can hover over distances, and his levels are similar to Sonic's except that he must beat an opponent to the finish line. Amy can't charge up ramps or run as quickly as Sonic and Tails, but she does have a giant hammer she can break obstacles with. The goal of her levels is to avoid being captured by a robot sent after her by Dr. Robotnik. E102 Gamma is a slow, difficult to maneuver robot, but it has guns and missiles that can lock on to several targets at once, chaining together attacks and earning a higher score and more time on the clock. The goal of its levels is to reach a boss enemy and destroy it before time runs out. The final character is Big the Cat, a fisherman searching for his lost frog. Big's levels are almost entirely devoid of action or fighting; he just fishes. Each character can find items that increase their abilities as the story progresses, such as a ring for Sonic that lets him home along lines of rings, or improved lures for Big. A final chapter wrapping up the story is unlocked after all other characters have been completed.\n\nAdditionally each of the characters can visit the Chao garden where they can raise baby Chaos. By petting, feeding, and showing animals found in levels to the Chaos they can grow stronger, and optionally be put into races against other Chaos. As well each level in the game has additional objectives that can be completed to acquire extra emblems, although the emblems don't do anything in this version of the game. Finally at one time it was possible to go online and download additional levels and bonuses in the game, such a Christmas theme for Station Square and a level sponsored by AT&T, but since SegaNet shut down this is no longer possible.",

      "description": "Introducing Lammy, a totally rockin' guitarist.  In day-to-day life, she's quite timid, shy, and wimpy - but put a guitar in her hands, and she'll blow you away!  Help Lammy get to her latest gig on time, and face obstacles such as flaming buildings, out-of-control airplanes, and even getting trapped in Hell.\n\nIn this sequel to PaRappa The Rapper you play as Lammy, a guitarist for MilkCan - the coolest, hippest band ever!  While <i>PaRappa</i> focused on lyrics, with each button controlling a different word; Lammy is a guitar player, so naturally, each button controls a different note on the guitar.  Lammy will encounter seven different teachers on her travels to the big gig, so either follow their lessons accurately, or do even better - improvise and blow them all away with your axe.  The teacher will then step away for you to go it solo for an even better performance.\n\n<i>Lammy</i> improves over <i>PaRappa</i> in a multitude of ways.  Rather than just being a single player experience, you can now play the game with a friend.  Any stages that you unlock can be played either co-operatively or competitively.  If you don't have a friend to play co-operatively with, you can also get the computer to take on the role of your partner.  After finishing the initial game, PaRappa also makes a return, allowing you to play through the game again with raps instead of Lammy's guitar.",

      "description": "<i>Resident Evil: Director's Cut</i> is a reissue of the original <a href=\"http://www.mobygames.com/game/playstation/resident-evil\">Resident Evil</a>.  Unlike <a href=\"http://www.mobygames.com/game/gamecube/resident-evil-\">Resident Evil</a> for the GameCube, it is not a remake of the original game, instead, it is more of a slight remix.\n\nThere are three gameplay modes available.  \"Original\" contains the original game with no changes or additions.  \"Beginner\" features double the amount of ammunition and save ribbons, plus increased health for the player, increased damage for their weapons, and an auto-target feature.\n\n\"Arrange\" mode is the \"Director's Cut\" version of the original.  The default outfits for Jill, Chris, and Rebecca are changed, new camera angles are introduced, and the placement of key items is changed.  Most of these changes are designed to play against the expectations of veteran players of the first <i>Resident Evil</i> - so zombie dogs may smash through new windows, or keys will not be where they were, forcing players to hunt for them anew.  The default Beretta pistol is also changed to a chromed version with a randomized chance to kill standard zombies in one shot.\n\nThe original release of the <i>Director's Cut</i> advertised an uncut version of the opening cinema, in full color, and never-before seen.  Notable aspects of this video include shots of a corpse with bites taken out of the face, close-ups of zombie dogs bleeding when shot, and graphic quick-cuts of Joseph being bitten by these dogs. Chris is also shown smoking in his introduction, which was cut from Western releases.  However, only the French and German releases contained this footage.  U.S. and UK versions retained the censored black-and-white video shipped with the original release.  This has never been corrected, either in the Greatest Hits reissue, or with the PSOne Classics downloads on the Playstation Network.\n\nThe original issue of the <i>Director's Cut</i> contained a demo of Resident Evil 2 on a second disc.  The \"Greatest Hits\" re-release added Dual Shock support for the controller (left \"movement\" stick only).",

When Harry gets closer to town, he sees that same motorcycle sprawled in the middle of the road.  Harry also spots a woman standing in the road, but due to the dense fog, he can't stop in time, so he swerves to avoid her, crashing into a railing, knocking him unconscious.\r\n\r\nWhen Harry wakes up, his daughter, Cheryl, is missing.  Sensing that she would head to the town to seek help, Harry sets out on a journey, not knowing what to expect from this eerie town, enshrouded with fog.\r\n\r\nYou play Harry Mason, a normal man, with no powers or training of any kind.  You must search through the town of Silent Hill, looking for your daughter.  You will come across many people, some friendly, some not.  You must visit many different areas, such as the school, and the church.\r\n\r\nWill Harry find his daughter and safely get out, or is there more to this town than a simple fog layer?",

The fatally wounded boy is approached by the Devil, who offers him his life and a chance to become a fearsome fighter in exchange for his soul. Determined to get even with his father, Kazuya agrees. Twenty-one years later Heihachi, now the head of a corrupt corporation, organizes a fighting championship his son is eager to join.\n\n<i>Tekken</i> is a versus fighting game similar in concept to Virtua Fighter. Besides Kazuya, other fighters of the tournament all have their own range of moves, something to prove, and a reason for any combat opponent to fear them. For example, Nina Williams is a trained assassin, Yoshimitsu is a robotic recreation of a ninja, and Marshall Law aims to set up a fighting school to pass on his knowledge. \n\nAs one of these eight figures, the player must come through fights in a 360-degree 3D environments with texture mapped backdrops and polygon graphics. After beating the seven rivals there are two bosses to beat. There are three difficulty levels, and fight lengths and number of rounds can be varied.\n\nEach limb's movement is controlled with a different button, making finding the right combos a matter of instinct and planning rather than experimentation. Pure martial arts inspire most of the moves. <i>Tekken</i> also introduced the ability to dodge an opponent's attack to versus fighting games, made possible by the 3D perspective. The slow-motion replay of the final moves allows the player to see where and what went right or wrong.",

      "description": "The research on the mysterious Third Energy is being continued in secret, but then an entire island with the facility conducting this research and a neighbouring town has vanished, moving back in time to the dinosaur era. A military unit is sent to the past to save the survivors and retrieve the research data. But nearly all soldiers are massacred by dinosaurs. You take control of Regina and Dylan, who managed to escape this fate. Now you must find the survivors, retrieve the data, and get back to your own time. \n\n<i>Dino Crisis 2</i> is a survival horror game in which you control the characters Dylan and Regina (switching from one to another at various points in the storyline). You will collect items and use them to solve puzzles while fighting the hordes of dinosaurs that inhabit the island. Much like Alone in the Dark, the game uses 3D models for characters, enemies and items and static 2D backgrounds for their surroundings. \n\nInitially, each character starts with a gun and a melee weapon, but more weapons, such as flamethrowers or rocket launchers, can be bought later in the game. The dinosaurs' attacks cause you to lose \"vitality\", which can be restored using healing items. Sometimes an attack will cause you to bleed and thus slowly lose health; specific health items stop the bleeding. \n\nFor each killed dinosaur you receive \"Extinction Points\". By killing a couple of dinos in quick succession, you activate a 'combo' and thus get more points. The points can be used in \"Save Shops\" throughout the game to buy weapons, ammo (and cartridge upgrades which allow you to store more ammo within the weapon), healing items and \"tools\" (such as armor, more powerful melee weapons, or \"cards\" which allow you to get bigger combos). You can also save the game at these points. \n\nWhile wandering around the island, you'll find many documents and letters to read, including \"Dino Files\", which contain a flavor description of a dino species.

He has also stolen the dragons' gems by locking them up in chests or turning them into soldiers for his army. But he forgot about one little dragon: Spyro. Now Spyro has to travel through the dragon kingdom and free all the dragons from their crystal prison, recover the dragons' gems and defeat Gnasty Gnorc. \n\n<i>Spyro the Dragon</i> is a 3D platform game similar to Super Mario 64. The game consists of six worlds: Artisans, Peace Keepers, Magic Crafters, Beast Makers, Dream Weavers and finally Gnasty's World. Each world consists of a home or hub area, three regular levels, one flight level and one boss level.\n\nThe goal of the game is to beat Gnasty Gnorc by working your way through all six worlds. Along the way you  have to find all 80 dragons, collect all 12 dragon eggs and collect as many gems as you can. Gems are found scattered throughout the levels, in treasure chests. Also, each defeated bad guy yields a gem and end bosses hold several gems.\n\nThe inventory screen shows progress for each level, how many gems found and how many dragons, it also shows many there are in each level. The real challenge lies in completing every level 100%. To do this you really have to explore every nook and cranny, the last gems are usually located on hard to reach places.",

Over the years, Selene grows larger, more powerful, and more independent of the Earth - to the point that the moon and Earth battle in a war that winds down without a definite victory for either side. In 2242, war breaks out again - the Earth slowly begins to win... except for the efforts of an experimental Selene technology known as Einh\u00e4nders: flying machines with a \"hand\" that allows them to change weaponry mid-battle.\n\nOn December 12, 2245, Selene sends down 3 Einh\u00e4nders in a last attempt to turn the tide of the war. You get to choose the craft to pilot, and it's up to you to battle your way through the Earth's monstrous defenses and win the battle.\n\nThe game is a traditional side-scrolling shooter, with rendered 3D backgrounds and enemies. The atmosphere of the game is very \"industrial\", down to the German industrial music playing in the background (think Einsturzende Neubauten mixed with Lords of Acid). The weapon-switching and claiming is an integral part of the game, as weapons have limited shots. This forces a bit more strategy than the usual button-mashing shooters inspire.",

      "description": "It starts as a simple assignment for the three mercenaries - the beautiful, mysterious Hana, the former army officer Glas, and the ruthless killer Deke. Somewhere in the futuristic Hong-Kong, full of huge corporations, flying cars and helicopters, home for the famous Triad mafia, they have to find the young Wee Ming Lam, the daughter of a powerful gangster. But Hana and her partners don't suspect that the search for Wee Ming will lead them not only to very dangerous areas of Hong-Kong, but to outskirt villages infected by zombies, a dubious restaurant-brothel, and the Chinese hell, where they'll have to confront Yim Lau Wong himself - the Chinese equivalent of the Western Satan.\n\nThe gameplay of <i>Fear Effect</i> is similar to survival horror titles such as Resident Evil, but it also features many pure action elements and arcade-like sequences, where precise timing matters. The player controls Hana, Glas, or (in a few instances) Deke during different chapters of the story. Player characters can crouch, sneak on enemies, and roll forward or to the sides. There are many human as well as monster enemies to eliminate or avoid. Characters can run and shoot at the same time, as well as use two weapons at once to combat multiple enemies. A considerable portion of the gameplay is dedicated to puzzle-solving.\n\nInstead of the traditional health bar characters have a \"fear meter\", which turns red and eventually kills the character whenever he or she is damaged or found in a particularly stressful situation. The functional difference between the fear meter and a regular health bar is the possibility to restore it to a normal green color by reducing the character's stress, e.g. solving a puzzle or killing an enemy in a stealthy way. \n\nThe game's 3D character models are unshaded, aiming to resemble cel-shading technique and anime art. The backgrounds are pre-rendered and often consist of streaming or looping full-motion video. The story unfolds through numerous pre-rendered movies.",

      "description": "The year is 2048, and a new terrifying disease known as EINDS (Environmentally Induced Nucleotides Degeneration Syndrome) is rapidly spreading, having already claimed over one billion victims. The disease attack directly the human cell DNA, and no cure is known. Crime flourishes, and scientists fear that the DNA manipulation may lead to unforeseen disasters that would eventually destroy mankind.\n\nFour people with different pasts and motivations arrive in Hong-Kong. Hana Tsu-Vachel is a young woman of French and Chinese descent, who was once a member of the criminal Triad organization, and now takes high-risk assignments in order to buy back her contract. Royce Glas is a former commander in the US military and an ex-member of a secret organization, now a mercenary, persecuted by his former employers. Jacob \"Deke\" Decourt is a professional killer from Australia, whose life purpose is to enjoy his bloody work. Rain is a mysterious young woman, found by Hana during one of her missions, lying unconscious in a garden. The search for a cure against EINDS leads these people to exotic locations, where Chinese folk tales and ancient legends co-exist with our reality.\n\n<i>Fear Effect 2: Retro Helix</i> is a prequel to Fear Effect, describing events that lead up to the beginning of the previous game. The gameplay is very similar to that of the predecessor, combining shooting, puzzles, and action set pieces. While the first game only featured a survival horror-style character-dependent control scheme, the prequel allows the player to switch to 3D camera-dependent controls. The game is more puzzle-oriented than the first <i>Fear Effect</i>, and contains more locations to explore. A few new weapons and items have been added.\n\nThe visual style of the preceding game is also present in this installment: the player navigates unshaded 3D anime-like character models over backgrounds, which are composed of pre-rendered images and looping or streaming full-motion video.",

      "description": "<i>Ehrgeiz: God Bless the Ring</i> is an arcade-style fighting game from the makers of  Tobal. In this version, Cloud, Tifa, Yuffie, Vincent, Zack, Red XIII & Sephiroth from  Final Fantasy VII join the many characters from the arcade version released in Japan. \n\nComprised of the main arcade mode, mini-game mode, and an all new RPG mode known as \"Brand New Quest\".\n\n The mini-game mode contains four games:\n\n - Battle Beach, a triathlon of button mashing.\n\n - Battle Square, tackle-Othello on a disco floor\n\n - Infinity Battle, an endurance test with unlimited lives.\n\n - And a foot racing game using the fighting game controls.\n\n The main game mode is an arcade-style fighting game.  Charismatic fighters from around the world compete in a tournament for a mysterious sword as the prize.  In addition to your archetypes of kick boxers, wrestlers, and mixed martial artists there are also animal type fighters, homing missiles, characters with swords, and many other attacks that shake things up.\n\n The fighting system is based on attack height (much like Bushido Blade) - with the triangle, square, and x buttons corresponding to high, mid, and low attacks respectively.  There are also different buttons for low and high guard - both working against mid-level attacks but specific to high and low attacks.  The circle button is used for 'special' attacks, which drain the 'special' bar.  There is a button to jump, as well as a button that changes between 'locking' on the target to move or free running.\n\n The standard balance in fighting games is speed vs. damage.  Whether it be ranged or melee attacks, the 'damage per second' should be the same - as every character has an equal health bar.  Ehrgeiz is a very balanced game, despite the complexity presented by how fundamentally different most characters are.\n\n The vast differences between certain characters require the player to devise separate strategies for different opponents. The animal type opponents, for example, can only be hit with roughly half the attacks of the normal opponents - head kicks, many long range attacks, and most throws will hit empty air, especially since animal characters can 'duck' even lower to the ground. Fighting a gun wielding character will result in a battle where you must chase and pin down. Fighting Cloud or Sephiroth will require both constant pressure and vigilance against being thrown to ensure that they are not able to unsheathe their sword and finish the fight in a few blows. \n\n The game features unlock-able costumes and characters, as well as 'ending videos'.\n\n The \"Brand New Quest\" feature is a dungeon delver that uses the fighting game engine along with randomly generated dungeon layouts to create a 25 level dungeon with set bosses.  It borrows the magic and equipment system from the Final Fantasy games, you will collect materia and magic stones, as well as a full range of visibly different weapons and armour.  This game puts strong emphasis on food (like the early Ultima series).  Not only will you have to eat, but you will have to be conscious of what you are eating - your diet affects how your stats change at level up.  Eat meat for strength, minerals for dexterity, carbs for speed, lipids for defence, and vitamins for magical ability.  Standing still allows your depleting 'stomach' meter to fill your health.  If your hunger meter reaches 'zero', however, it will start draining your health.  \n\n There are two playable characters, and the game can be played with both characters or with only one.",

      "description": "Aya Brea is back in a new game. This time there are fewer RPG elements than the first game, and the game plays more like Resident Evil. Battles are now entirely action-oriented, and a new range of weapons is available. Defeating enemies rewards money as well as points used to revive and power-up Aya's suppressed Parasite powers, like healing and igniting foes. Weapons and armor now have fixed stats, but attachments can be swapped in and out of them to modify their properties.\n\nAfter surviving the events of <i>Parasite Eve</i> Aya left her job as a cop and became a member of MIST (Mitochondrion Investigation and Suppression Agency) in order to hunt down the remnant mutants spawned by Eve's awakening. In the year 2000 a new breed of Neo Mitochondrion takes over the Akropolis Tower in downtown LA. Aya is called in and uncovers a secret organization that threatens all humanity.",

      "description": "The powerful and holy Moonlight Sword was stolen from King Alfred of Verdite. Prince Alexander, one of the king's closest friends, embarks on a journey to retrieve the sword. During his voyage a terrible storm overcomes his ship, and it sinks to the bottom of the sea. Alexander miraculously survives and is washed ashore on the mysterious island of Melanat. He has to explore the island, aware of the monsters roaming it, and find the sword.\n\n<i>King's Field</i> (originally dubbed <i>King's Field II</i>) is the second game in the series, and the first one to become localized in Western countries. Like its predecessor, it is a first-person 3D action role-playing game with a heavy emphasis on dungeon crawling. The game takes place in world consisting of interconnected areas, which gradually open up as the player acquires keys and other means to enter them. Most of the time the player is free to explore large areas, though he may encounter powerful enemies he is yet unable to defeat.\n\nThe player character can attack physically with melee or ranged weapons (bows), as well as cast magic. Physical attacks and spells are each assigned to a different button. Character growth is handled by repeatedly executing the same types of attacks and applying certain items to raise attributes. New in this installment is the learning of magic from special crystals. Most of the creatures encountered in the game are hostile, with only a few offering help such as procuring different types of crystals needed to make healing potions. Every NPC in the game, whether hostile or friendly, can be killed by the player. Alexander can sprint now, though doing this depletes his hit and magic points and he must rest for a while to recover them. It is also possible to teleport between areas.",

      "description": "150 years ago, the legendary warrior known as the Brave Fencer Musashi saved the kingdom of Allucaneet from the evil Wizard of Darkness. Now, his spirit is reincarnated in a young, rather short-tempered boy. Fillet, the princess of Allucaneet, summons the reluctant hero to the palace and gives him the powerful sword Fusion, which he needs to defeat the evil Thirstquencher Empire. It soon turns out that the Empire is after another legendary sword, Lumina, so Musashi's first task is to get it before the bad guys do!..\n\n<i>Brave Fencer Musashi</i> is an action game with strong RPG elements. Controlling Musashi, the player explores the pre-rendered backgrounds from third person view (similarly to  Final Fantasy VII), visiting towns, talking to NPCs, etc. There is a day/night cycle in the game, which is manifested in the schedules of NPCs and/or monsters, as well as Musashi's fatigue level, which increases if he doesn't sleep enough. Musashi uses the two swords, Fusion and Lumina, to fight his enemies. The two swords have different properties: while Fusion behaves more or less like a traditional melee weapon, Lumina needs to be imbued with various elemental items in order to unleash powerful attacks.\n\n",

      "description": "The Bushido code of honor governs the actions of the Samurai and sets a code of ethics for use in fighting. Sometime in the 20th century, a group of Narukagami ninja, each proficient in a different style, find themselves in a battle to regain their honor in the fighting ring.\n\n<i>Bushido Blade</i> is a versus fighting game with several unique features. It does away with health bars, special meters, and other traditional gimmicks and allows for battles to be won with a single hit. Players select from among six ninja, each of a different fighting style and attributes. Players also choose equipment from among eight weapons, including Japanese swords, European blades, naginata and a sledgehammer. \n\nBattles take place in wide open areas in which combatants can run around as well as climb up and down. Some structures, like bamboo trees, can even be cut down. In the single player game, players can even run through the entire castle, picking a preferred fighting ground location. In addition to the single player story mode, there's a versus mode, a slash mode where you will be attacked by 100 generic ninja in one long corridor, a training, and a 'POV' mode, which allows players to play from first person, heightening the realism. The game's versus mode can also be played using two Playstations linked up.\n\nGameplay involves picking one of three stances, then attacking high, middle, or low. Directions while attacking change attacks, and attacks can be combo'd. Player damage is location based, with hits to arms often making them useless, hits to legs crippling, and hits to heads and clean across the torso being mortal. The use of stances and the easily achieved one hit kills make <i>Bushido Blade</i> one of the most deadly, and therefore realistic, weapon fighters around. ",

      "description": "Two samurai families who date back over eight hundred years have been feuding ever since the Gempei War, where the Kagami family sided with the Minamoto and ensured themselves a victory over their rivals, the Sue. Over the centuries since, the two families evolved into ninja clans, but their hatred of each other never faded. Now, in the 20th century, the Shainto, descendants of the Sue, are in a position to bring vengeance on the Narukagami. \n\n<i>Bushido Blade 2</i> takes place some time after the events in the original game, and is also a weapon fighting game without health bars, power displays, or over-the-top special maneuvers. The game features the Story Mode, Versus Mode and Slash mode present in the original game as well as a new tournament mode, where the two sides face each other with shinai and other bamboo weapons in a kendo like ring. Fighters have different styles (including some with two sword nito and iaijutsu styles) and there are many weapons to choose from (although the hammer has been replaced with the yari spear). The controls have changed somewhat, but stances are still in the game, as are one-hit kills if blows strike a sensitive part of the body.\n\nInitially players can choose from six warriors, three from each clan. As progress is made in the story mode, supporting characters will be encountered. If beaten, those characters will become available for play in the game's other modes. ",

Dhalsim and Zangief also return to the fight with some news moves.\n\nThe other major difference is the loss of chain-combos and the gain of a custom combo system. Once you reach the required level (which is 1 at the least) you can execute a custom combo by combining any of the buttons (which there are 6 in total) or any of the special attacks (fireballs, etc.)",

Honda, Blanka, Vega, Cammy, T. Hawk, Dee Jay, Juni and Juli. Some of the newest fighters on the block include a former Final Fight character (Cody, who has been in jail since the last Final Fight game, or so his clothing suggests), Karin Kanzuki and Rainbow Mika.\n\nThe major difference between this Alpha and the last two are the new play modes World Tour, Arcade, VS, Training and Entry. \n\n<b>World Tour</b> - Simply choose your fighter and travel around the world, fighting the home town heroes that you run into. The more fights you win, the stronger you fighter becomes. You can also learn new moves, and there are three levels of Super moves to choose from before you start each round (called Isms).\n\n<b>Arcade</b> - A simple conversion of the arcade version. Beat each fighter with your chosen warrior, in three rounds per match (much the same as past versions of Street Fighter)\n\n<b>Versus</b> - Two human players battle it out. \n\n<b>Training</b> - A good way to learn all the super moves that are available, against a dummy.\n\n<b>Entry</b> - If you save your character during the World Tour mode, you can upload him here to use in the other modes in the game (especially handy for Training).\n\nFinally, if you complete certain areas of the game three new fighters become available, including another old favourite in Guile, Evil Ryu and Shin Akuma.",

      "description": "Five years ago, Richter Belmont, the latest in the Belmont lineage and the one destined to be a Vampire Hunter, defeated Dracula in a brutal battle which nearly cost him the love of his life, Annette, and her sister, Maria. Now, Richter has suddenly vanished, Dracula's castle has mysteriously reappeared, and Maria, now a young woman, sets off to find Richter. Alucard, the son of Dracula, is awakened from his eternal slumber after this large shift in power, and enters into the castle to find some answers and confront his own father.\n\n<i>Symphony of the Night</i> is a direct sequel to Rondo of Blood. Unlike the previous installments of the series, the game is set in a castle which the player can explore freely with many different paths, although often items in certain areas need to be found that will allow passage to others. The action-based gameplay incorporates now strong RPG elements. The hero receives experience points for defeating enemies, gains levels and becomes more powerful. There is also money to be found in the game, and various accessories to buy. In a separate screen, players need to equip attack weapons, shields and other items. Magic plays an important role, as well as secondary weapons and a large amount of \"special moves\" that are executed similar to advanced one-on-one fighting games.\n\nThe Saturn release adds two new areas to the castle (the Underground Garden and the Haunted Path), a third playable character (Maria), and a few new remixed music tracks. However, it sacrifices a few of the graphical effects from the PlayStation version, particularly true transparencies. All other releases are based on the PlayStation version, and do not feature these changes.",

As a pilot for the Thunder Force group, it's up to you to destroy an evil alien race bent on destroying the Earth and all of its inhabitants. As in its predecessors, the gameplay is fast and furious, with more powerful weapons. All weapons now have an extra powerful blast mode, triggered by holding down the fire button. Sprites have been forfeited in favour of 2D polygons made possible by the new platform. The musical score contains a lot of techno rearrangements of old Thunder Force themes. In spite of all the changes, Thunder Force V aims to please fans of old-schoolers by not abandoning concepts and details introduced in earlier games in the series.",

      "description": "Following genetic experiments conducted by a group of scientists at the turn of the millennium, a biological explosion contaminated the genetic structure of life on Earth. Two attributes emerged from the ruins, known as Silhouette and Mirage; like Yin and Yang, they cannot exist without each other, but are fundamentally opposed in their nature and ideology. Only a Messenger, one who contains both attributes in a balance, is able to get to the Edo facility and reverse back the genetic disaster, destroying both Silhouette and Mirage. This messenger is a young girl named Shyna Nera Shyna.\n\n<i>Silhouette Mirage</i> is a side-scrolling action game. The basic gameplay is somewhat similar to that of Gunstar Heroes. The game's standout feature is the concept of the two attributes. Depending on the enemy's attributes and the type of attack used by Shyna, damage can be increased, and spirit (equivalent to magic power) can be absorbed from enemies. Shyna can dash, jump, crouch, slide, and grab enemies, executing combo attacks. It is also possible to master moves, acquire money, and purchase special creatures called \"parasites\", which teach Shyna various types of attacks.",

      "description": "Tokyo-to, a city not unlike Tokyo, somewhere in Asia, in the near future. This is the story about the GG's, one of three rival teenage gangs who ride motorised inline skates and are tagging the streets with graffiti. There is a turf war going on between the gangs GG's, the Poison Jam, and the high-tech freaks, the Noise Tanks. The evil Rokkaku Corporation has the corrupt police in their grasp, and, headed by Captain Onishima, the cops are hell-bent on subduing the unruly teen protagonists. But there is light in the darkness: the underground DJ, \"Professor K,\" and his Jet Set Radio station keep tabs on what is happening on the streets of Tokyo-to, and soon our teens will have something much darker than the police to worry about.\n\nAs one of the GG's, you skate through a variety of different levels, from busy streets to run-down rooftops and smelly sewers where you learn new moves, collect spray cans, and tag the streets with graffiti. New graffiti designs can be unlocked by finding \"Graffiti Souls\" in levels, by designing new graffiti yourself, or by going online and downloading any images you find while browsing the internet. Fight the rival gangs \"Poison Jam\" and the \"Noise Tanks\", the evil mega-corporation Rokkaku and their police cronies in this fresh take on the platform genre, mixing traditional platform elements with skating similar to that of the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater games. Players are scored on their performance in a level, both on the level of graffiti attempted as well as optional tags and skating tricks. As the game progresses challenge maps open that test the player's ability to do larger tags, more tricks, or race against an opponent.\n\nThe American and European release contained two new levels based on New York. The story and order that you meet characters was modified to include these two levels. Both releases also have different unique soundtracks for these levels.\n\nThe 2012 HD version has widescreen HD graphics and a new camera system, as well as all the original songs but one.",

Whilst using a portal to travel to the coast, he is enlisted to help a professor defeat Ripto the dinosaur. \n\nThe game is split into 3 worlds - on each of these Spyro must collect all the gems and then kill a boss. Level layouts are less linear and more expansive than many platform games, with lots of sub-quests - exploration is required.\n\nThis time around, the fantasy 3D worlds are larger and more complex. Though most of the gameplay elements from the original game have remained, more puzzle elements and bonus levels have been added to this chapter. Spyro has a new ground-pounding move.",

It is your duty to take up the investigation and find out the secrets of Shadow Island. But you're not going alone... your companion will be a redhead by the name of Aline Cedrac who has her own reasons for tagging along. Aside from being a woman and inexperienced in the world of danger, she is the only one with the knowledge for translating the ancient Abkhani tabloids which may hold the secrets behind Carnby's friend's death and the disappearance of Aline's father.\n\nUpon arriving on the island, your plane has been shot down by the things unknown, and the heroes have no other choice but to jump with a parachute, thus separating them on the island.\n\nNow you choose the character to play with, either as Edward Carnby or Aline Cedrac, as they explore the mysterious and gloomy island with all its secrets and parallel stories that contain different locations and tasks for different characters, thus adding the level of replayability in a different experience - Carnby's story is more action oriented while Cedrac has more puzzles to solve. \n\nJust like in the predecessors you move your characters through pre-rendered backgrounds while the camera perspective switches around. You collect various items and books which are used to solve puzzles. Many situations can only be solved with violence which means you'll have to use guns to get rid of your foes. Aiming is manual and especially when playing Cedrac ammo is scarce. Saving a game uses up a save medallion which can be found during the game.",
