      "description": "Commonly considered the earliest progenitor of first-person shooters (FPS), <i>Battlezone</i> is a 3D tank game initially released in the arcades, and later converted officially to many systems. Earth has been invaded, and you and your tank lead the defensive effort. You drive around the battlefield from a first-person view, targeting and firing at tanks, planes and UFOs. You have a radar to help you see where the enemies are in direction and distance. Objects can be used as strategic cover. Controls simulate the tracks of a tank realistically, so the direction and speed settings are varied - combining forward right and backward left movements (as you can on keyboard versions) sees you change direction more quickly.",

There are three different types of fighters roaming throughout the galaxy; cruisers, fighters, and basestars. With the help of your galactic map, you can find the sectors of the galaxy where these fighters are located and then warp there to destroy them. When all of the fighters in a sector are destroyed, you can warp to a new location for the next battle. Be sure to keep an eye on your starship's energy level; warping to new locations, being hit by enemy fire, or colliding with an asteroid will drain your energy. If you completely run out of energy, your starship will be destroyed, however you can warp back to a starbase to refuel at any time. Returning to a starbase will also repair other types of damage your starship can receive, such as faulty engines, loss of your shields, and faulty photon torpedoes. When all of the enemy ships have been destroyed, you win the game and receive a rank.\n",

You begin the game with five balls, and need to score as many points as possible by hitting the ball into the various bumpers and targets on the pinball table. The pinball table consists of three different screens, each with a different layout and level of difficulty. To advance from one screen to the next, you need to use a single ball to hit several targets and then get the ball into a white cup that appears. If you are on the second or third screen and the ball falls off the bottom, you will be back to the lower screen; if the ball falls off the bottom screen you will lose that ball. The game ends when all five balls have been lost.",

Fresh from the flight-academy he learns from an good friend of his father, that his mysterious death was caused by sabotage. As a last gift from his father, he gets the ownership of the one-of-a-kind ship Darkstar One and now makes his way to find out the truth behind his fathers death.\n\nDarkstar is a mix of Freelancer and Wing Commander: Privateer as you can fly your ship either with a mouse or a joystick. \n\nAs you solve the riddle you can visit 330 star-systems in which you can trade goods from other systems, take contracts like blasting a pirate gang out of the sky or try to be a pirate yourself. Every action influences the reputation with at least one faction and the game gives you total freedom in what you want to do or what career you want to pursue.\n\nIt is also possible to search for artifacts. As opposed to other games of this type, you don't buy a bigger ship. Through the whole game you only fly the Darkstar One. You upgrade the ship through artifacts you found in asteroids. If you have enough artifacts for an upgrade, you can boost the basic attributes of the ship. This enables you to install more and bigger weapons or goodies like a shield-booster.",

The game includes 17 GP tracks as well as 17 faster, less technical (and also fictional) \"Extreme\" tracks. Some of the modes available are typical racing types, with Career, Stunt and Practice being a few.\n\nThe updates to the game in this particular case are refined controls, updated graphics to bring the game up to par with the capabilities of the 360, new bikes and racers and quite importantly a heavily re-worked and refined Live play mode, which supports up to 16 players in a race on either the \"GP\" or \"Extreme\" tracks.",

With 8 difficulty settings there is a lot of the game to master as you must start to keep an eye on your fuel, torpedoes, radar, and enemy while avoiding depth charges as the difficulty rises.  You can fire up to two torpedoes at a time. While enemy shows go by your periscope sink as many as you can.  The periscope can turn 360 degrees and look off into the horizon or close to your sub.  Some ships move slower than others, and one of the ships moves so fast that the only way to hit it is by tracking it by radar instead of visually.",

You can focus on entertainment, commercial activities or science, but you also have to construct buildings, provide enough power and repair all your structures. Every port can be micromanaged for content and price, and you can upgrade to new expansions and sell the old ones. At the same time, you have to keep an eye out for alien attacks or asteroids.\n\nThere are two story modes: Adventure and War, with goals for each mission, based on shielding off attacks, constructing buildings or getting revenues. There are seven races and 50 space stations to play with. Like most tycoon games, there is also a sandbox mode where you can play without objectives or restrictions. Soon after the release, additional scenarios and picture packs were made available.",

In singleplayer mode, you try your hand at specific challenges, tournaments and basic games, accompanied by achievements. There is also a help function available to learn the fundamentals.\n\nIn the online mode, you can join open-table games with up to eight players. All known actions are available through the interface. Your cash is saved at all times, both online and offline, but you can re-buy when you are out of money. There is no option to play for real cash, though. To avoid relying on careless all-ins all the time, waiting for a lucky break and starting over all the time, certain tables require a large amount of chips before you can join.\n\nNo (virtual) players are visible, the game is shown through a first-perspective with a camera that can be panned up and down. There are also various modes in multiplayer and you can create custom games.\n\nFor 48 hours after the release, the game was made available for free to all Xbox Live Gold and Silver members. After that, the game was available for 800 points on marketplace.",

Nurture your garden to attract a wide variety of unique Pi\u00f1ata species as you aim to keep your residents happy.\n\n<i>Viva Pi\u00f1ata</i> is a simulation in the vein of a game like Harvest Moon. While there is no specific story or goal to the game, you can progress further by attracting many different types of Pi\u00f1atas into your garden.  At first, you'll only have a small patch of land covered in junk; however, with some cleaning up and basic maintenance, you can begin to attract many different species, starting from the tiny Whirlm, to larger creatures like Horstachio.\n\nIf you're more interested in money-making than collecting, you can get the Pi\u00f1atas to produce goods, like honey or milk, for you.  Failing that, you can simply sell off any of your excess Pi\u00f1atas after you learn how to get them to mate.  Each species has its own particular ritual and conditions for mating.  Occasionally, mischievous Sour Pi\u00f1atas will turn up to cause trouble in your garden.  If you can cure them of their sour condition, they'll help your garden instead!  You can also get the services of the local Pi\u00f1ata Island residents, such as shopping, garden maintenance, and Pi\u00f1ata capture (if you require a particular species).",

      "description": "Star Trek Legacy begins a few years after the end of the TV-series Star Trek Enterprise. Starfleet is growing fast and new technologies have been introduced like the tractor beam or starbases. You take the helm of the starship Enterprise NX-01 which has been heavily upgraded with all the cutting edge technology and your mission is to find a missing Vulcan ship. During the campaign you play get the chance to play all the great ships from the five series up to the USS Voyager under the command of Captain Janeway. All five captains (Archer, Kirk, Picard, Sisko, Janeway) are voiced by their actors from the TV-series.\n\nYou control your ship either directly with the keyboard or by giving orders to your helm on a map of the current sector or by marking planets or enemies in directly on the screen. Depending on how good you solved a mission, you earn command points with which you can buy up to 4 ships. They function like a squad. You can either give them individual commands like defend this position or take the lead and tell them to do, what you do. If you aren't satisfied with the actions of your individual ships, you can take over the helm yourself at any time.\n\nDuring the campaign you only take control over ships of the United Federation of Planets and fight against Klingons, Romulans and the Borg. But in skirmish as well as in multiplayer, you can take either side yourself and fight against up to 4 other players or together against a common threat in coop in which each player takes control over one ship of the squad.\n\nAlso there's much fighting with enemy ships, your mission goals include escorting medical ships to poisoned planets or defending planets against incoming asteroids.",

These include a new default GUI created with the aid of user feedback in an attempt to make it more user friendly. \n\nThe game also includes pre-match team talks. In the previous edition, only half-time and full-time team talks could be given. The game has also increased functionality of the half-time team talk, managers can now target individual opposition players for special attention, such as instructing players to close them down or always to tackle them with force. \n\nA significant new addition is the ability to create a feeder club affiliation. This allows larger clubs to set up a relationships with a smaller club and vice versa. This can be used by users managing larger clubs to loan out players to their feeder club to gain the first team experience that they are unable to get at higher levels. On the other hand, the smaller clubs can benefit from the ability of these players. \n",

      "description": "<i>DiRT</i> is the first racing game in the Colin McRae series not to solely focus on the rally championship. It features other offroad events with vehicles like buggies, jeeps or trucks all licensed from the manufacturers. Races are not always solo against the times of other drivers, but up to eight cars often race together on a single track.\n\nThe main game mode is the career where you work your up a pyramid of different tiers with events ranging from normal Rallies over Crossover or Corr to Hill Climb. For every event you complete successfully, you get points and money. Money is used to buy new cars. While the amount of money depends on choosing one of the five difficulty levels, the amount of points depends on your final result in the event; you receive the maximum of 10 points for completing an event with a first place regardless of the difficulty level. These points are needed to unlock new events in the current tier. If you have gathered enough points the next tier will be automatically unlocked so you don't need to do every race in a tier in order to unlock the final event at the top. The difficulty level not only influences the strength of the other drivers, but also how critical the damage is upon hitting obstacles. Some events are further split up into two or three races where the damage is carried over and the allotted sixty seconds worth of damage repair is not offered after every subevent. The main parts that can be repaired are the engine, turbo, exhaust, gearbox, bodywork, wheels, suspension, cooling system and it is also possible to clean the entire car.\n\nAll events feature several licensed true-to-detail-vehicles which also have a detailed damage model. Each vehicle can in addition be tuned in several categories like engine or suspension before each event. To help you make it even more individual, you can create your own look of the car with several dozens predefined kits. There are also 182 different liveries to collect in the game and 46 different cars.\n\nIn addition to the career mode, the game features the classic Colin McRae rally mode with four championships where you need to proof your worth in several car categories like 2WD or Classic. Of course you can also do a time trial, a single event or a single race.\n\nIf you're tired of driving only against the AI, you can go online and compete against up to 100 other players at the same time. An official ranking ladder is also available. After each race your best times can be compared directly to other drivers worldwide.",

However, the new heart of the game is the Racing career. There you not only create your very own character but you also fully customize your own ride from the general look to nearly every bolt inside. Every GrandPrix features the three stages practice, qualifying and race but you don't need to go through all of them. In addition there are three challenges for every course like Speed Run in which you've 45 seconds to reach the goal and if you're fast enough you can earn either a bronze, silver or a gold medal. The qualifying and race are also watched by the program and you can fulfill several goals like being 1st in qualifying or being on the podium at the end of the race.\n\nAt the end of each GrandPrix you not only get some money to invest into your ride but you also gain some credits with which you increase the stats of your character in the four talent \"Cornering\", \"Braking\", \"Top Speed\" and \"Acceleration\" to make him more like a Pro.\n\nThe fictional \"Extreme\"-mode is also part of the game again and the 17 old tracks have been revised and 20 new motorcycles are waiting to be driven around the courses in both single player and multiplayer.",

Handling is loose and arcade-oriented, and the setup options are not as detailed as those in DiRT. \n\nThere are fifteen circuits across 5 terrain types - safari, alpine, tropical, canyon and arctic. As such, you must drive through snow, sleet, sand, mud, water and gravel. Track deformation technology ensures that no 2 laps are ever the same, as grooves are impacted into the ground and snow is moved off the primary racing line.\n\nGame modes include Quick Race, Championship, Time Attack and Online multiplayer. Time Attack allows plays to set their best times and upload them to 360 Live or PSN. Similarly, players can download other individuals ghosts and try to beat them. Online multiplayer caters for online battles between up to 6 players.",

      "description": "<em>Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock</em> is the third full game in the Guitar Hero series and fourth game overall. The gameplay remains similar to the previous games: using a guitar-shaped controller, you need to coordinate pressing the five fret buttons and strumming to the scrolling notes on screen. Missing notes will cause your performance meter to drop; if the meter drops too low then the performance is a failure and you will need to try again. This edition of the game features 71 new songs to play from various artists including Cream, The Rolling Stones, Black Sabbath, Aerosmith, Guns N' Roses, Santana, Sonic Youth, Weezer, and many more. In addition to the available songs the game also features \"boss battles\" against famous guitarists such as Slash, Tom Morello and Lou the Devil. Several game modes are available including career mode, co-op mode, and multiplayer mode. In addition to the main game modes, training and practice modes are available to aid in learning the game or figuring out a tricky passage in a song.\n\nIn <b>career mode</b> you play the part of a wanna-be rock star. Beginning with easier songs in small venues, you need to successfully complete tracks to make your way up to a superstar. Each venue you play requires a certain number of songs to be performed before you can move on to the next larger venue. Successful completion of songs also earns money which can be used to unlock characters, outfits, new guitars, and other bonuses.\n\nThe <b>co-op career mode</b> is similar to the single player variation, except two players work together (one on lead guitar, the other on bass or rhythm guitar) to complete songs. \n\nThe <b>multiplayer</b> game modes allow two players to compete against each other. In the Face-Off variation, two players take turns performing a song. The Pro Face-Off variation allows two players to compete at the same time playing the exact same note chart. Finally, in the battle mode each player can earn power ups by performing well which can be used to disrupt the other player.",

Most of the game's new content is provided through the Earn Your Stripes career mode (PS2).\n\nIn Earn your Stripes, you start by going through time trials to get better starting contracts. After you get a contract, you can start racing. You can tune up your car in the areas of acceleration, tire wear, top speed, among several others. After a set amount of races, you will need to go through another time trial to get to the next set of races. As you complete races and gain reputation, more contracts will come in. In every race, you need to complete some objectives set in your contract. Some contracts are easy to complete (such as finishing a race), while others give more complex objectives (such as gaining several allied cars). Players can also race in the Craftsman Truck, National (Busch), and NEXTEL Cup.\n\nThe PS3 and Xbox 360 versions allow players to share their setups online. The chase mode offers a series of challenges like drafting or passing to unlock new features. All versions offer online multiplayer races.",

      "description": "<i>Rock Band</i>, by the original developers behind the Guitar Hero games, takes the concept a step further. Instead of solely playing the guitar along with songs, this game allows players to start a full virtual band with up to four players, with different sequences for each of the three supported peripherals: guitar (electric and bass), drum and microphone. Gameplay is based on hitting scrolling notes on the screen in time (scrolling vertically for drum and guitar), and getting the right pitch for the vocals (scrolling horizontally at the top of the screen, along with the lyrics).\n\nThe game offers a Solo Tour Mode for a single player or a Band World Tour (as well as Quick Play) for two to four players. By doing well players earn cash to customize the characters in the Rock Shop, with tattoos, face paint, clothing and logos. Customized characters are automatically locked to an instrument. Other customizations include movements on stage, instruments, and the general physique and appearance in the game. To succeed, players need to reach a set score through their combined performances. Multipliers for playing perfectly are tracked for the individual instruments and there can also be separate difficulty levels. The Star Power from the Guitar Hero series has been replaced by Overdrive, a meter filled by not making any mistakes in certain sections of a song. In band play using Overdrive also increases the band's score multiplier.\n\nPlayers who fail during the song are locked out and the audio mix takes over. Other band members can revive the player by using their Overdrive. Failed players will however drag down the band's overall performance, so it becomes important to bring back band members. Next to the Overdrive sections, there are also Union Phrases (score bonus and extra Overdrive) and sometimes Big Rock Endings at the end of a song where another bonus can be gained.\n\nIn the Tour Mode players visit 41 venues in seventeen different cities. After the initial venues, others need a certain numbers of fans to be unlocked and certain continents only become available when tour buses or private jets are acquired. Not every venue comes with a set list of tracks. They consists of single tracks, multiple tracks, custom setlists or mystery setlists. Performing poorly can also have the band lose fans. Extra competition is included to attract managers, roadies and deals with record labels. \n\nNext to the main modes there is also a versus mode for the individual instruments (Tug of War), Score Duel (get the most points) and a Tutorial mode. The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions feature multiplayer games with new songs through downloadable content.\n\nThe European version is not sold as a single package. Instead, there is an instruments package and the game is sold separately, for a much higher price than the original US release.",

These motion controls include drumming the remote and nunchuk when trying to speed up and using the remote as a bat when hitting.\n\nInstead of a traditional season mode as in many other baseball simulations, in <i>The BIGS</i> there is a mode titled Rookie Challenge, where the player creates a ballplayer and tries to lead him and his team to the World Series. Another mode, Home Run Pinball, puts a hitter in the middle of Times Square, New York, with the aim to hit balls into windows and neon lights.",

      "description": "The heart of <i>GRID</i> is the career-mode called GRID World. Divided into the three regions USA, Europe and Japan, the player has to earn money and prestige points to move up into a higher license category which then gives him access to more and harder racing events. These events are divided into categories like normal races, Drift-events, Destruction Derbies and even the famous 24 hours race in Le Mans.\n\nBut of course not every car is suitable for every event so there are several different series to chose from. So while the player drives a tuned car for the Drift- or Racing-events in Japan, muscle cars await him in for the Destruction Derbies in the USA or Formel 3000 racers in Europe. Each car also handles very differently. Of course the player needs to buy the suitable car first before he can enter a tournament. There he can decide if he wants to buy a brand new car or go over to eBay Motors and look for a solid used car which of course cost less but has already seen some crashes and might not provide the best possible performance.\n\nTo earn the money to buy a car for a event, the player can complete so-called Driver Offers. These are offers by other racing teams to take part in an event and see it through. But there are also bonus objectives like \"Finish before Team Top Secret\" which grant the player additional cash if he successfully completes them.\n\nBesides money the player also earns prestige points. These are required to unlock the next higher license category in the corresponding country. Of course tournaments give way more points than completing Driver Offers but the player can also get a few more points by adjusting the realism settings before the race. The higher the realism is, the higher the point gain will be after successful finishing the event. These settings include things like a difficulty level, traction assistant or how many flashbacks the player has available during a race. These flashbacks are similar to the Sands of Time in the Prince of Persia-Series. If the player for example drifts out into the gravel pit, he can activate the instant replay, rewind time a little bit and then immediately reenter the race at that point and try to avoid the crash.",

      "description": "<i>Guitar Hero: Aerosmith</i> is considered an expansion of Guitar Hero III and it is the first title in the series primarily focused on a single band. The gameplay concept is similar to the game it is based on. About 60% of the included tracks are by Aerosmith, while the others have influenced or have opened for the band (Run-D.M.C., The Kings, Lenny Kravitz, ...). Four songs were re-recorded by the band directly for the game and they also performed as motion capture actors for their 3D models. The majority of the tracks consists of master recordings.\n\nThe prominent game segment is the career mode where players go through the band's history, from the earlier seventies to 2001. Times of internal issues are not touched upon. Players initially start as Joe Perry but can later also unlock the other band members Brad Whitford and Tom Hamilton. The career has been divided into six tiers with five tracks, each based on a period in the band's history. There are also encores when a tier has been completed, and two opening acts playing as another band. After each tier, bonus material is shown such as trivia or video sequences and interviews.\n\nSongs are unlocked gradually and become available in the other modes, identical to <i>Guitar Hero III</i> (Quickplay, Cooperative, Competitive + Battle modes). Only the cooperative career mode is absent. The menus have been redesigned and there are new venues, based on historical performances. There are 41 songs in total, of which 31 can be unlocked in the career mode and an additional 10 in the vault.\n\nThe game is available in a bundle with a custom guitar or as a single game release. For the PS2 version there are two bundles, one with a single, wireless guitar and another with two, wired guitars.",

It once again gives the player the opportunity to take the reigns of an NFL franchise and coach them to the <i>Super Bowl</i> and ultimately be enshrined in the <i>Hall of Fame</i>.  Once again the player will hire and release players, along with assistant coaches and various office personnel as well as edit plays to be used by their team.\n\nGames are once again played out in real time, but the player has no control of their team, instead they coach their players, telling them what runs to play as well as make game breaking decisions such as going for the win on 4th and goal with only a few seconds on the clock or faking a field goal and going for two points to win rather than tie the game.  Players can also control their team in the offseason, tracking future players in the <i>NFL Draft</i>.\n\nPlayers can also go online and share their playbook for others to view as well as compete head-to-head, coaching their team against their opponents.",

It's up to you to help restore the records, and keep those candy-filled pi\u00f1atas coming!\n\n<i>Viva Pi\u00f1ata: Trouble in Paradise</i> is the sequel to Rare's gardening simulator, Viva Pi\u00f1ata.  The overall game remains the same - lure pi\u00f1ata by tending your garden.  Some animals are attracted by the appearance of others, while others will come because of the types of plants that you grow.  As you progress, the more valuable your garden will become - and that means that Professor Pester and his Ruffians will turn up to try to vandalize it, either causing fights with pi\u00f1ata, or smashing your most expensive object.\n\n<i>Trouble in Paradise</i> includes all the pi\u00f1ata from the original game, as well as some new species that can only be found by traveling to the Dessert Desert or the Pi\u00f1arctic.  These pi\u00f1ata are wild, and need to be lured with bait and caught.  Unfortunately, new Sour Pi\u00f1ata are also waiting to come in and cause problems for you as well.\n\nA new feature of the game is Pi\u00f1ata Vision, which uses the Xbox Live Vision Camera to scan in cards.  These cards can drop in an assortment of items into the game - anything from new pi\u00f1ata, to garden objects, to tools - even shop discounts!  Players can even take a photo of an object in their garden and transform it into a Pi\u00f1ata Vision card to send to a friend.  The game also features two mini-games - a Pi\u00f1ata racing game, and Pi\u00f1ata contest game.  Winning these mini-games increases your pi\u00f1ata's value.",

      "description": "<i>Guitar Hero: World Tour</i> is the fourth main game in the series and brings a major change to the concept. Following the release of Rock Band that built on the <i>Guitar Hero</i> concept but added additional instruments, <i>World Tour</i> introduces these as well to allow players to play together simultaneously as a real band. Next to the guitar that was the main peripheral for the previous titles, the bundled edition of the game adds a microphone for the vocal parts and drums for percussion. Just like the previous game, the guitar tracks are split up for the lead and bass. The lyrics and the vocal pitch is shown near the top of the screen, while the bottom part is split up for bass guitar, lead guitar and drums, each with a separate set of notes that need to be hit to correctly play the part.\n\nWhile playing, a rock meter keeps track of successive notes hit (one for each player), which leads to score multipliers. When the meter becomes too low, other players can make up for this on a shared, general performance meter. In the same vein players share a star power meter, built up by playing through certain sections successfully, that any player can access.\n\nThere are four difficulty levels and a new beginner mode where notes are made as easy as possible to introduce the concept to new players. Most of the game content is centered around a Career mode (both Solo and Band) where players start a new band, choose an avatar an instrument, and then play different gigs unlocking new songs along the way. Completing tracks earns money that can be spent on outfits or instruments. There are once again encore songs and \"boss challenges\" where the lead guitar enters a duel. This is similar to the battles in <i>Guitar Hero III</i>, but without the power-ups. Instead it returns to a call-and-response mechanic similar to the Face-Off mode. Bands consists of offline players but online members can join as well. Complete bands can take on others online through the Battle of the Bands mode.\n\nThrough the Music Studio editor new songs can be composed and shared using the GHTunes service (not for the PS2). In this edition avatars can be customized with more detail using the Create-a-Rocker mode. Major artists have licensed their appearance in the game. The Wii version contains a Mii Freestyle mode where players can use their Mii characters in-game and compose songs through motions of the Wii remote and the Nunchuk controller.\n\nThere are several bundles for the game, based on the amount of instruments included, but also a stand-alone version as most of the versions are compatible with the controllers of previous games and even some of <i>Rock Band</i>.",

Directly competing with Guitar Hero: World Tour, the game allows different people to play together as in a band, with the same peripherals as the first game: lead guitar, bass guitar, microphone and a drum set.\n\nThe new drum and guitar controllers for this version, bundled or sold separately, have been revised and older controllers are also supported. The guitar controller, modelled after the Fender Stratocaster, has five additional fret buttons near the neck, for fast fingertapping sessions. There is also an effect switch to toggle between five different effects. Players use the instruments to match notes on the screen, divided in different portions for different instruments, along with the lyrics for the singer who need to match the pitch.\n\nThe original game's Solo Tour mode and the multiplayer Band World Tour mode have been merged into a single Tour mode where up to four players can cooperate, both local and online (PS3/Xbox 360). Band leaders are no longer necessary and instruments can be swapped at will. From this mode, three options are available: Start Tour (regular tour mode), Tour Challenge (different challenges), and Battle of the Bands (compete against other bands online through score tracking - not on the PS2). The game includes a training mode for the different instruments, as well as a freestyle mode for drummers where they can drum along with custom mp3 files (Xbox 360/PS3). Other modes and modifiers for the regular game modes can be selected from an Extras menu.\n\nThe in-game characters can also be customized and 84 tracks are included on the disc, with many more as downloadable content (not on the PS2). It is also possible to transfer the songs of the first <i>Rock Band</i> (for a price), and downloadable content as well as the two track packs.",

But the situation isn't going very well. No horse has won for a few seasons and even worse, some are falling sick. As the story unfolds we realise that the only way to get the ranch out from its financial problems is to win the final race in Kentucky. \n\nOther changes: new five mini-games loosely connected to the horse riding called \"fun games\" to unlock: Gather the foals, Play with a ball, Break in the Bull, Race with Katelyn, Labyrinth.\n\nIn \"My Horse and Me\" on the Wii platform, the horse jumps automatically and we steer the horse by moving wiimote and nunchuck up and down. In the second part, we steer the horse by turning wiimote and nunchuck left and right. We can also choose whether we jump automatically or by pressing the A button. Differences in gameplay are only because of different control (wiimote / keyboard / pad).\n\nThe game is also licensed by Federation Equestre Internationale FEI (International Equestrian Federation).\n",

It was updated to allow players to use their Xbox LIVE Avatars when NXE was released. \n\nMost of the puzzles in the game involve selecting one of four multiple choice answers to a trivia question about movies. Many of the puzzles are simple text questions, others have players viewing a movie clip, listening to an audio sample, or unscrambling an anagram. One of the puzzle types new to Box Office Smash, Pixel Flix, has players identify a movie based on a pixelated animation that evokes early computer adventure games. Another new puzzle, Crosswords, has players filling in a crossword puzzle as nearby letters gradually appear, making the clue more obvious as time goes on. Approximately half of the puzzles require allow the first player to buzz-in to offer an answer, the other half let all players answer simultaneously.",

      "description": "<i>The Sims 3</i> is, like its predecessors, a real-time simulation game where the player controls the lives of one or more people in a family including their work life and social activities. In order to do so, at the start of the game the player creates one or more characters on the character creation screen which has been even more expanded since The Sims 2. Besides more choices in terms of look, clothes, colors and such, the player also chooses five personality traits from a set of 63 sorted in four groups \"Mental\", \"Physical\", \"Social\" and \"Lifestyle\" as well as a lifetime-goal. The personality traits influence how the Sim reacts to each event in the game. The trait \"work-a-holic\" for example makes the Sim love to go to work and allows him to use a computer at home to put in additional hours.\n\nThe lifetime goal, on the other hand, is similar to wishes but requires a lot of work to get to. While granting wishes can be as simple as ordering a pizza, one lifetime goal requires the player to make his Sim a CEO of a big corporation which can't be done over night. As a compensation, the fulfilling of a lifetime goal grants the player a very large amount of lifetime points as opposed to the normal wishes. These lifetime points are used to buy numerous forms of relief including the ability to make the Sim immune to hunger. This allows the player to focus less on fulfilling the basic needs of a Sim but more on advancing his skills and socializing with neighbors, co-workers and other people in the city. The six needs themselves are the same as before including fun, hygiene and hunger.\n\nAs opposed to its predecessors, the game isn't limited to the property a Sim owns with loading times in-between traveling to other places like family retreats. Instead <i>The Sims 3</i> now simulates a full city the player's Sim is free to move around in and do what he wants, including working and socializing, but also buying groceries or books and visiting classes to further advance his personal skills. However, not every house can be seen from the inside. While the gym functions like a normal house with the ability to remove the walls and look inside, other places including the workplace, book store and hospital the Sim just enters and vanishes until his duty has been fulfilled there. The only influence the player can make in case of the workplace is how his Sim should go about his work. Should he work through lunch, get friendly with the boss or talk to his co-workers and such. All this influences both his happiness and his job performance and once his job performance reaches a certain level, he get's promoted which includes a higher pay and sometimes different work hours. during his visits the Sim can also collect stones, gems, metals, bugs, butterflies and seeds to be used in his garden, as decoration or jewelery. If he is really bored he can even go fishing at one of the lakes and rivers.\n\nWith the money a Sim starts with and earns during the game, he either buys a pre-created lot or builds/expands his own house from ground up including all of the interior decoration. This time around stuff can even be placed in an 45\u00b0 angle.\n\nThe console versions introduce karma powers where players receive godlike powers to influence the life of their sims for better or worse.",

      "description": "<i>The Beatles: Rock Band</i>  is the second released game in the Rock Band series to focus on a specific band, following the AC/DC Live: Rock Band  release.\n\nThe title borrows features from the Rock Band 2 game, but offers a revamped career mode, with the opportunity to play a story mode going through the different Beatles eras, with specific songs and venues, from The Cavern Club to their rooftop performance on top of Apple Corps' studio.  Whilst the game attempts to capture the spirit of significant periods in the band's history some liberties were taken in the presentation; for example Ringo Starr is shown playing the drums on Back in the U.S.S.R. despite not appearing on the actual recording and the studio versions of songs are used in the Live at the Budokan section. Along with the now classic guitar, bass, drums, and vocals parts, the title adds the possibility to have three separate vocals parts, where each singer gets to sing in a different harmony.\n\nThe game features 45 remastered Beatles titles, and further albums will be released, available for purchase through DLCs and exclusive to <i>The Beatles: Rock Band</i>. This is the first time that Apple Corps allowed the Beatles\u2019 music to feature in a video game.\n\nContrary to the AC/DC game which looked just like the original Rock Band, the entire game is skinned in a Beatles theme: characters, overall look and feel, sound effects. Skinned instruments were also released. Also still contrary to the AC/DC game, it is not possible to export the songs to play in Rock Band or Rock Band 2.\n\nThe tracklist:\n\n<b>Singles</b><ul>\n<li>I Want to Hold Your Hand</li>\n<li>I Feel Fine </li>\n<li>Day Tripper</li>\n<li>Paperback Writer</li>\n<li>Revolution</li>\n<li>Don't Let Me Down</li></ul><b>Please Please Me (1963)</b><ul>\n<li>I Saw Her Standing There</li>\n<li>Boys </li>\n<li>Do You Want to Know a Secret</li>\n<li>Twist and Shout</li></ul>\n<b>With the Beatles (1963)</b><ul>\n<li>I Wanna Be Your Man</li></ul>\n<b>A Hard Day's Night (1964)</b><ul>\n<li>A Hard Day's Night</li>\n<li>Can't Buy Me Love</li></ul>\n<b>Beatles For Sale (1964)</b><ul>\n<li>Eight Days a Week</li></ul>\n<b>Help!

      "description": "The player's goal in <i>Need for Speed: SHIFT</i> is to take part in the Need for Speed World Tour and become the ultimate champion. As opposed to its predecessors, this doesn't mean racing around an open-world city with pimped cars. Instead the game is more similar to GRID with races taking place on closed city circuits or even famous race tracks like the Circuit de Spa-Franchorchamps.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, the player drives a test-round as well as a race. During this tutorial the game evaluates the player's skill and changes the realism settings accordingly ranging from the usual arcade-style controls with many driving aids to an almost realistic simulation-like driving model. Then the main game begins where the player has to successfully earn stars in order to unlock the next tier and ultimately gain access to the World Tour. Stars are earned by getting on the podium at the end of a race as well as by fulfilling certain objectives on the track. These range from simply gaining a specific amount of points in the race to more challenging objectives like driving a clean lap. Points on the other hand are earned by the player through his driving style and are separated into two groups: Precision and Aggression. While the first group honors clean sectors or driving on the race line, aggression-points are earned by hitting other cars or sliding through curves. Once the player has earned enough points (both categories are summed-up at the end of an event, he gains a level and by doing so unlocks new upgrades for his car, get's a big money bonus or receives an invite to a special race event. To keep the player even more motivated, tons of badges are waiting to be earned which are in part also the same as the available achievements/trophies. Again actions like performing 25 overtakes or winning three consecutive races are needed to earn a minor badge. If he keeps his streak up or has earned all the minor badges in one category, he earns additional badges ranging from bronze to epic.\n\nThe available events include normal races in various variations, a time attack mode, a car attack in which the player needs to be either five seconds in front of his opponent or get 1st place in order to win and drift events. The car park includes many licensed cars from normal middle to high class vehicles to high-powered racing cars which can all be bought through the money earned by winning races or leveling up. In addition the look of the car can be changed by unlocking new vinyls. Also available are extensive upgrade and tuning options allowing the player to change every detail on his car down to the tire pressure.",

      "description": "<i>Lips</i> is a singing game in the vein of Sony's SingStar series of games.  Much like the popular past time of karaoke, players sing along to the lyrics of songs that are displayed on-screen.  The game also judges you based on pitch, earning you points based on how accurately you sang.  At certain points in the game, players are prompted to perform gestures with the microphone (such as tilting it upwards).  When they do this, the bonus 'Star Stream' mode is activated which earns even more points.\n\n<i>Lips</i> can be played in either Solo, VS, or Co-Op modes.  At any time during solo play, a second player can shake their wireless mike to create a multiplayer game.  VS mode is a battle for the highest score, while Co-Op has players working together to achieve a high score.  If both players trigger Star Stream simultaneously in co-op, their star bonuses are doubled.\n\nThere are also special game modes for those who want to try something different: in Kiss, the on-screen couple gets closer together the better that both players sing.  When they get close enough, you'll be prompted to tilt your mikes up to make them kiss.  Time Bomb lights a bomb's fuse at the start of the song.  By singing well, you'll fill a glass up with water - when there's enough water inside, use it to extinguish the fuse.\n\nPlayers who don't want to sing can still participate by using a controller as a Noise Maker.  This allows them to add sound effects such as snapping fingers, cowbells, tambourines and even crowd noise to the song.\n\nThe song list is localized for different countries, with certain tracks only included in the version for specific regions. Below is the main track list that is largely shared across versions. An overview of the localized differences can be found through the related links section.<ul><li> Ace of Base - The Sign\n<li> Alicia Keys - No One</li>\n<li> Avril Lavigne - Complicated</li>\n<li> Ben E.

      "description": "Skira is a lovely little island in the Pacific Ocean just north of Japan and was always the center of many conflicts because of its strategic value. Sadly, nice beaches and crystal blue water isn't the only thing Skira has to offer. After the second world war, the Russians managed to gain control over the island and found a huge oil deposit of a size similar to the ones in the middle east. No one cared at first but China's economy grew and grew and with it their need for oil. Then the recession hit. China's manufacturing industry was especially affected and civil unrest got stronger and stronger bringing the country closer and closer to a civil war. Because of these riots the National People's Army guarding the Russian border under the lead of General Zhang was put on high alert, further increasing the tension between China and the international community. As Russia was preparing for the worst-case-scenario, General Zhang suddenly invaded Skira saying that the island is the rightful historical property of China. Since Russia is too busy preparing for a possible war against China on the ground, they ask the USA for assistance in regaining control over the island. Soon afterwards UH-10 Black Hawks are sighted over Skira and in one of those helicopters: the player.\n\n<i>Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising</i> is an action-orientated military-simulation. The player moves through the mission areas in a typical first-person-shooter fashion and has to fulfill certain objectives like blowing up a generator or taking out anti-air-guns in order for the invasion to move along. But since realism plays an important part in this game, the player can't just walk up to the enemy base and shoot everyone. Instead he and his three squad-mates have to use the different stances like crouching and couching to move from cover to cover in different formations and think before a bullet is fired or in short: the player needs to take a tactical approach in order to not end up dead in the high grass. To that end, he has a radial, context-sensitive menu at his disposal with which he can give specific orders to his teammates. In addition, the player can change the weapons-load-out of each team-mate (and himself) at the beginning of each mission to what best fits the situation. The armory only covers real-world weaponry like the MK16 MOD 0 Assault Rifle. If all the sneaking didn't help and combat ensues, the player has to watch both his blood- and injury-status. Depending on where and how badly he has been wounded e.g. his arm, his ability to keep his weapon straight decreases. In addition each wound causes the player to loose blood and of course once he has lost too much blood, he'll lose consciousness and the mission is over.\n\nThe game features several multiplayer-modes. The players can either take on the whole campaign together or just one mission or engage each other in \"Destruction\", which is similar to Team Deathmatch, or \"Infiltration\" in which the smaller team has to fulfill an objective while the other has to prevent it from destroying their target. As opposed to the single-player campaign where the player has only limited access to vehicles like jeeps or helicopters, the selection in multiplayer is much greater and covers everything from a HUMVEE to a AH-1 Cobra helicopter. The PC-version also includes a powerful map-editor.",

      "description": "<i>Guitar Hero 5</i> is the fifth main game in the musical rhythm series. Similar to the previous title, Guitar Hero: World Tour, the focus is on a band-experience, with a lead and bass guitar, drums and vocals. The title is available standalone or bundled with the instruments.\n\nNext to a new soundtrack with 85 songs, many animated lead singers are now modelled after famous musicians such as Johnny Cash, Carlos Santana, Shirley Manson, Kurt Cobain, and Matthew Bellamy. Players can still compose their own songs in the included studio and the game relies heavily on downloadable content, through tracks and full albums. A portion of the songs of <i>Guitar Hero: World Tour</i>, Guitar Hero Smash Hits and Band Hero can be imported in exchange for a small fee per song.\n\nIn the Band Lobby players can assemble a party of local and remore players to form a band, play the Career mode or opt for Quickplay. Most of the competitive multiplayer modes are carried over from former versions, along with two new ones: Party Play (random song selection with the option to join and leave at will using any instrument) and RockFest, a band mode for up to four (local) or up to eight (online) players with a variety of submodes. The songs are divided in smaller portions and for each section the players are rewarded based on a variety of conditions.\n\nGeneral new features introduced to the gameplay include drop-in/drop-out play, where it is possible to join in the middle of a song or stop playing without interrupting gameplay. There is also a new Challenges section in the Career mode.\n\nThe different game versions are identical, except for the PS2 version that lacks online game modes and downloadable content, drop-in/drop-out play and song challenges. It is also limited to two instruments and the multitap is not supported. The Wii version is very similar to the major console versions, including downloadable content on SD cards, multiplayer through the global Wii address book, and the Mii Freestyle mode from the previous game. It also supports interaction with the Nintendo DS to edit videos and provides access to the Roadie Battle mode, similar to the main battle mode of Guitar Hero III, where players complete mini-games on the Nintendo DS to sabotage the players on the console.",

As the matchmaker you ask the contestants questions and judging from their answers you get an idea of what the character likes and dislikes. You only have a certain amount of \"match points\" to ask questions for each round, The characters can give you an honest answer but also lie to you, making it more of a challenge to figure out who they would match best. The more rounds you use to ask the candidates questions, the smaller your potential winnings will be. Different match levels are available in the game too, for example \"shallow\" will only match candidates based on their preferences in appearance while \"deep\" takes both appearance, interests and personality into consideration. A local leaderboard with rankings determined by four different categories is also available.",

      "description": "As it's predecessor, the racing-game <i>DiRT 2</i> doesn't just focus on accurately simulating the Rallye-sport like the earlier installments of the Colin McRae-Series did. Instead eight types of Offroad-events await the player during the main campaign called DiRT Tour:\n<ul><li><b>Rallye</b> - The player has to get as fast as possible to the finish line. He's the only one on the course at the same time and instead has to deal with hairpin curves and difficult terrain.</li>\n<li><b>Trailblazer</b> - Basically the same as Rallye but instead of narrow courses, this mode features long and open stages.</li>\n<li><b>Raid</b> - Races over wide and open terrain with many dangerous shortcuts allowing the player to get distance between him and the other drivers.</li>\n<li><b>Landrush</b> - All drivers start at the same time and the tracks are littered with crazy curves and jumps.</li>\n<li><b>Rallyecross</b> - Takes place on round-courses with a mix of dirt and asphalt streets.</li> \n<li><b>Gatecrasher</b> - The player has a limited amount of time to get to the finish line. To replenish that time, so-called gates are scattered around the track each granting +2 seconds upon destruction.</li>\n<li><b>Domination</b> - Similar to Rallye, the tracks are divided into sectors. Each sector gives 1-10 points depending on how fast the player in relation to his opponents finishes it. In addition 1-10 points are added for his final position in the race once he crosses the finish line. The winner is the driver with the most points.</li>\n<li><b>Last Man Standing</b> - As the name implies, the goal here is to race around the course and be the last car in the race at the end with the last car being removed after each lap.</li></ul>\nEach event requires either a different car or at least a so-called race-pack for that car both bought with the money earned by winning these events. Each car can be customized both visually and under the hood with parts unlocked by gaining a level. Experience points are awarded both for finishing races as well as completing missions like jumping over the finish line or getting through a race without any damage. The amount of cash earned at the end of each race, is influenced by the difficulty level. The higher the difficulty, the higher the reward. In addition the difficulty-level also changes the amount of flashbacks that are available for the race (from five to none). Flashbacks allow the player to rewind the action a few seconds when he made a mistakes or crashed and allows him to try that section again - hopefully without making the same mistake a second time.\n\nThe game features many real-world racers including their voices and their cars who give the player tips during the course of the DiRT-tour and also offer him additional challenges including duels and time trials. They'll also take part in team-events with the player, if he keeps them happy by not crashing into them that often during races.",

In this satirical simulation game you take on the role as Jennifer, starting from your first day at work at a new office. Here you get to do exciting office-related tasks like mailing documents, obtaining a parking pass and even saving the company! Try to keep your spirits up too since you'll be facing all the dreaded office-related difficulties such as layoffs, reorganizing and your boss. It's important that you tend to your bodily functions too. This is handled with a The Sims-like system where you see how much you need to empty your bladder, sleep, eat and drink. When one of your motives falls to a critical level, a stress meter will show up and increase, eventually causing you to quit your job and resulting in game over. The gameplay is accompanied by satirical dialogue, poking fun at pretty much everything there is to office work.",

New to the series is the ability to choose between the simulation handling like previous games, and arcade handling, which is new for the series. As the game is predominantly a simulator, it features realistic damage models including engine damage and bullet holes on the hull of your aircraft.\n\nMultiplayer includes 4 game modes, which include Dogfight (basic death matches), Team Battle (team death matches), Capture (akin to capture the flag, in this, you have to land on an airstrip and hold it for long enough. The enemy must take you out and capture it themselves) and Strike (team game, you must destroy the enemy base before they destroy yours).\n\nPlanes featured in game include the IL-2, IL-4, Hurricane Mk II, the Spitfire Mk II, IX XVI, JU-87, and the P-51.\nYou have the option to apply different skins to these planes.\n",

      "description": "<i>Band Hero</i>  is a karaoke/rhythm based game, similar to the Guitar Hero games, but directed at the pop loving teenage crowd, as well as a more group based party game (unlike with guitar hero, full band instruments are included from the beginning of the series).\n\nThe instruments are the same as in the more recent GH games. You have the microphone for vocals, guitars for either lead or bass guitar and the drum kits for drumming along. Accordingly, each instrument has its own 'career' path in game.\n\nIf you are doing the vocals for your band, you have to sing along in time to the music, matching the pitch as closely as possible. Lead and bass guitar is played by holding down the fret buttons and strumming as the appropriate fret icons cross the strike line on screen. Drums are done similar to the guitars, hitting the correct drum pad's/cymbals at the correct time. The better you do, the more points you score, however if you make too many mistakes, you will fail the song.\n\nYou can either play alone on any of the instrument careers, or you can play with up to three friends on one console or online to compete with other players and bands from across the world.\n\nSongs featured include Duran Duran's <i>Rio</i>, Don McLean's <i>American Pie</i>, Evanescence's <i>Bring Me To Life</i> and Queen's <i>Crazy Little Thing Called Love</i>.",

The Xbox 360 version features the possibility to import the Xbox avatar who walks around the game field as giant worker- since this obviously doesn't work on the PC there are seven pre-defined characters to choose from.",

      "description": "<i>MLB Front Office Manager</i> is a managerial simulation where the player is responsible for the athletic and financial success of his baseball team. As with most non-German games of this genre the financial aspect is limited to player trading and hiring players through free agents. The player spends the most time with his team: line-up, studying extensive statistics (divided over many menus in a big font) and tactics. The matches are shown in a 3D presentation and the player can give commands to his athletes.\n\nBefore starting his career the player can choose his former profession which influences his stats, e.g. a former scout has a good eye for talents. With successes the player gains experience points which improve his stats. Besides the usual 30-year career there are three fantasy playing modes: In \"Rotisserie\" the championship is not solely based on the athletic success of the team but in the personal ranking of the player in certain categories, in \"Head-to-Head\" the player changes his team multiple times during a season and in the third finances play absolutely no role. There is also an online-league.",

      "description": "<i>Beat'n Groovy</i> is a music and rhythm game centered around dancing girls. Players pick a girl and then a song (from an obscure selection) for her to dance to. The gameplay element consists of hitting notes in a timely fashion as they drop down the screen in one of the five coloured columns, passing a line, similar to the Guitar Hero mechanics. Confusingly each colour is mapped to a very different control mechanism, ranging from the D-Pad to pressing two buttons together for a single colour.\n\nAs the player does well a combo builds up and a meter ranging from bad to good reflects this. On the screen a visualization of the dancing (drawn) girls is shown. At a higher combo they start doing more risky moves. The game supports two-player games, both offline and online, and an arcade, training and endless mode. There is an additional game mode that supports the Xbox Live Vision camera where you play along doing motions instead of using a controller.",

      "description": "<i>Lips: Number One Hits</i> is the second game in the karaoke series and largely continues the ideas from the original Lips title, but with a fresh bunch of tracks. This title solely consists of songs (all master tracks) that have reached a number one position on the global charts. Players have to sing along with lyrics on the screen using a microphone to fill empty bars, along with pitch and timing lines to get it right, while a video plays in the background. Points are awarded based on accuracy. This builds a meter that can be used to unleash a Star Scream. When it's available you tilt the microphone and all lines are filled with stars. You can then fill them with your voice. The points are used for a levelling system along with medals that can be earned. Instead of the original video another type of visualization can be shown as well, and it is possible to reduce the vocals more. The menus have been overhauled, but the in-game mini-games are still identical.\n\nThere are Solo, VS and Co-op modes. While playing a second player can shake the microphone to hop in. The motion controls are also used when your avatar (or a silhouette if you have none) turns up in between verses. They show a motion such as moving their hands in the air or playing a guitar and you have to mimic it. The same has to be done when a tambourine or a maraca appears on the screen. You move the microphone as if you're playing the instrument. Players with a regular controller can still hop in and make noise that adds to the song or distracts other players. Importing custom songs through USB is also still supported.\n\nMost of the DLC from the original game can be carried over and when a savegame for the original game is detected, the songs can be imported by swapping the disc. After every track the original disc needs to be reinserted however. The game comes bundled with a wireless, motion sensitive microphone and a redemption code to download a five-song pack for free from the Lips store.\n\nThe 40 songs included on the disc are:<ul>\n<li>2Pac feat. Dr. Dre and Roger Troutman - California Love</li>\n<li>Akon - Don't Matter</li>\n<li>Atomic Kitten - The Tide is High (Get the Feeling)</li>\n<li>Aqua - Barbie Girl</li>\n<li>Beck - Loser</li>\n<li>Black Eyed Peas - Don't Phunk With My Heart</li>\n<li>Blondie - Heart of Glass</li>\n<li>Bob Sinclar - Love Generation</li>\n<li>Bobby McFerrin - Don't Worry Be Happy</li>\n<li>Colbie Caillat - Bubbly</li>\n<li>Coldplay - Viva la Vida (also the game's theme song)</li>\n<li>Culture Club - Karma Chameleon</li>\n<li>Cutting Crew - (I Just) Died In Your Arms</li>\n<li>DJ \u00d6tzi - Hey Baby</li>\n<li>Extreme - More Than Words</li>\n<li>Fergie - Big Girls Don't Cry</li>\n<li>Fine Young Cannibals - She Drives Me Crazy</li>\n<li>James Morrison feat. Nelly Furtado - Broken Strings</li>\n<li>Jason Mraz - I'm Yours</li>\n<li>Kanye West - Heartless</li>\n<li>Lady Gaga feat. Colby O'Donis - Just Dance</li>\n<li>Lily Allen - The Fear</li>\n<li>LL Cool J - Around The Way Girl</li>\n<li>Mariah Carey - Touch My Body</li>\n<li>Marvin Gaye - I Heard It Through the Grapevine</li>\n<li>MC Hammer - U Can't Touch This</li>\n<li>Nickelback - How You Remind Me</li>\n<li>OneRepublic feat.

      "description": "<i>Party Classics</i> is the third main game in the <i>Lips</i> karaoke series and builds on the concept of the previous games. The visuals have been slightly overhauled, which is most apparent in the menus, with different themes. Largely the same modes are supported, along with the ability to sing long or short versions of the songs. There is a singleplayer mode, and multiplayer with versus, co-op and a number of mini-games. Players have to sing along with lyrics on the screen using a microphone to fill empty bars, along with pitch and timing lines to get it right, while a video plays in the background. Songs can never be failed, players just receive less points. The real music videos are supported, along with custom, animated ones. Points are awarded based on accuracy. This builds a meter that can be used to unleash a Star Scream. When it's available you tilt the microphone and all lines are filled with stars. You can then fill them with your voice.\n\nThe motion controls are still used when your avatar (or a silhouette if you have none) turns up in between verses. They show a motion such as moving their hands in the air or playing a guitar and you have to mimic it. You move the microphone as if you're playing the instrument. There are some new moves such as clapping to the beat in time.\n\nJust like the previous games the series' sensitive wireless microphones are supported, but for the first time regular USB microphones can be used as well, from Rock Band or Guitar Hero for instance. With those, avatar movements, mini-games and percussions instruments are not supported, as those peripherals are not motion sensitive. Importing custom songs in the Freestyle mode from a USB device is also still possible.\n\nThe disc-swapping mechanism to import songs from other <i>Lips</i> titles is still retained. Those songs can be imported by swapping the disc in-game. The only improvement is that the original disc does not need to be reinserted after every song anymore. Once Lips: Number One Hits has been inserted for instance, you can continue singing songs from that disc without having to swap back constantly. The mic tutorial makes a return, to making syncing the microphones easier.\n\nNew to the series is the performance viewer. Any performance can now be saved to watch again afterwards. The Jukebox mode has been removed and it is replaced with the ability to make a playlist from the main menu.\n\nThe 40 songs ranging from 60's up to the 90's included on the disc are:<ul><li>4 Non Blondes - What's Up</li>\n<li>Alannah Myles - Black Velvet</li>\n<li>Amy Winehouse - Rehab</li>\n<li>Aqua - Doctor Jones</li>\n<li>Black Eyed Peas - Let's Get It Started</li>\n<li>Cameo - Word Up</li>\n<li>Chumbawamba - Tubthumping</li>\n<li>DeBarge - Rhythm of the Night</li>\n<li>Deee-Lite - Groove Is in the Heart</li>\n<li>Divinyls - I Touch Myself</li>\n<li>Don McLean - American Pie</li>\n<li>Dusty Springfield - Son of a Preacher Man</li>\n<li>Foreigner - I Want to Know What Love Is</li>\n<li>Gloria Gaynor - I Will Survive</li>\n<li>James - Laid</li>\n<li>James Blunt - You're Beautiful</li>\n<li>Kiss - Rock and Roll All Nite</li>\n<li>Lynyrd Skynyrd - Sweet Home Alabama</li>\n<li>Maroon 5 - She Will Be Loved</li>\n<li>Mr. Big - To Be With You</li>\n<li>Nancy Sinatra - These Boots Are Made For Walking</li>\n<li>New Order - True Faith</li>\n<li>Opus - Live is Life</li>\n<li>Percy Sledge - When a Man Loves a Woman</li>\n<li>Poison - Every Rose Has Its Thorn</li>\n<li>R.E.M. - Shiny Happy People</li>\n<li>Right Said Fred - I'm Too Sexy</li>\n<li>Robert Palmer - Addicted To Love</li>\n<li>Sixpence None The Richer - Kiss Me</li>\n<li>The B-52's - Love Shack</li>\n<li>The Cure - Friday I'm in Love</li>\n<li>The Knack - My Sharona</li>\n<li>The Pretenders - Brass in Pocket</li>\n<li>The Righteous Brothers - Unchained Melody</li>\n<li>The Spice Girls - Wannabe</li>\n<li>Tiffany - I Think We're Alone Now</li>\n<li>Tom Jones - It's Not Unusual</li>\n<li>UB40 - Red Red Wine</li>\n<li>Village People - Y.M.C.A.</li>\n<li>Whitesnake - Is This Love</li></ul>",

As the title implies, the focus of this version is the music of the eighties and there are no notable changes to the gameplay mechanics. \n\nThe game is available stand-alone, and bundled with a wireless microphone. Just like <i>Lips: Party Classics</i>, regular USB microphones can be used as well, from Rock Band or Guitar Hero  for instance. With those, avatar movements, mini-games and percussions instruments are not supported, as those peripherals are not motion sensitive. Importing custom songs in the Freestyle mode from a USB device is also still possible. The disc swapping problem of the previous game is still present.\n\nThe tracklist includes:<ul>\n<li>ABC - The Look of Love</li>\n<li>Alphaville - Forever Young</li>\n<li>Bananarama - Cruel Summer</li>\n<li>Blondie - Dreaming</li>\n<li>The Buggles - Video Killed the Radio Star</li>\n<li>Chicago - You\u2019re the Inspiration</li>\n<li>The Communards - Don\u2019t Leave Me This Way</li>\n<li>Culture Club - Do You Really Want to Hurt Me</li>\n<li>The Cure - Boys Don\u2019t Cry</li>\n<li>David Bowie - Let\u2019s Dance</li>\n<li>Devo - Whip It</li>\n<li>Dexys Midnight Runners - Come On Eileen</li>\n<li>Duran Duran - Rio</li>\n<li>The Beat - Mirror in the Bathroom</li>\n<li>Erasure - A Little Respect</li>\n<li>Feargal Sharkey - A Good Heart</li>\n<li>Frankie Goes to Hollywood - Relax</li>\n<li>Huey Lewis & The News - The Power of Love</li>\n<li>Human League - Don\u2019t You Want Me</li>\n<li>J.

To keep the ladies happy and continue dating them, the player must talk to them, listen to their problems, arrange dates and keep them from finding out about one each other.\n\nWhen the player gets to meet a new girl, she will ask him on a date and provide a time and a day they want the date to take place. You must then decide on the details of the date itself, this includes how long you will be with them, how much you will pay and what you will talk about. There are multiple options for the player to choose from which consist of two answers that will produce either one of two possible neutral responses, one positive response, or one negative response. The game starts with only a couple of girls, but as the game progresses the player will have more ladies to split the time between.",

      "description": "<i>Rock Band 3</i> is the third game in the main Rock Band series, and features numerous new additions to the original game.  As with previous games in the series, players form a band (of up to seven players) and perform a song together using guitar, bass, drums, vocals (solo or harmonies) and new to this game, keyboard.  By working together, players can maximise their scores.  Each player can fill a power bar by performing special sets of notes.  When they have enough of these, they can activate \"Overdrive\" which adds a x2 multiplier for each player that has Overdrive activated simultaneously (so, for example, having four players with Overdrive activate will score you x8 rather than x2 for only one person).\n\nVocal harmonies, first introduced in The Beatles: Rock Band, are carried over into the main <i>Rock Band</i> series for the first time.  Up to three players can perform on the microphone, with one player performing the lead, and the remaining players performing backing vocals.  By keeping in harmony with each other, players can earn double or triple score, depending on how many players can keep up.  The game also introduces a new style of play for each of the instruments, \"Pro Mode\".  Pro Mode is more accurate to actual instruments for those players who are looking for an even greater challenge - guitars have multiple buttons on the fret board and players must actually strum strings, the drums must have the three cymbal attachment, while with the keyboard, even more keys are used so that the performance is much closer to actual play.\n\nThe Career Mode of the game has also been revised for this game.  Rather than grinding to earn money to unlock new items, the game is instead based around Achievement-like \"goals\".  Each goal you unlock earns you more fans for your band, and often unlocks new items of clothing or instruments.  All songs are initially unlocked so that those who just want to play for fun can, while those looking for a deeper experience can tackle the \"Road Challenge\" mode, which has you travelling to different venues and performing song sets.  Each star you earn for a song gets transformed into \"Spades\" at the end of the performance, and the more Spades you earn, the more goals you unlock which again translates into even more fans and items.  Bonus Spades can be earned by performing the requested tasks at the start of each song, such as continuously deploying Overdrive, performing note streaks while you're in the spotlight, or deploying Overdrive when full and then performing note streaks.",

      "description": "<i>Kinectimals</i> is one of the launch titles for Microsoft's hands-free controller, the Kinect sensor. The game falls in line a bit with Nintendo's Nintendogs titles about playing with and taking care of virtual pets. Except here, petting the animal has moved from swiping a stylus across a small screen to physically petting the animal with your hands using the Kinect camera.\n\nThe game features thirty different cubs that can be raised, trained, and played with. It also features light story elements focused on pirate treasure with various mysteries to solve on and about the island, Lemuria, on which the game takes place. A small flying character known as Bumble introduces the player to the game and various other elements, such as guidance on the story part of the game. Initially five cubs are available (Cheetah, Royal Bengal Tiger, Black Panther, African Lion and African Leopard), but later on six additional ones can be unlocked (Bornean Clouded Leopard, Serval, White Jaguar, Bobcat, Siberian Tiger and Saber-tooth Tiger). Additional ones can be added to the game through downloadable content and toy animals that come with scan codes that can be held up to the camera to redeem them. These are tied through game shops and a deal with Burger King for instance.\n\nBesides simply raising and petting a virtual cat, the player can also take part in mini-games with pets, as well as teaching them tricks. Mini-games involve some abstract ideas for a virtual pet, such as jumping rope and driving the pet around on a remote control car. Aside from the story elements, the game is very open-ended allowing players to experience the game, generally, however they want.",

      "description": "EA's 2010-2011 release in their NCAA Football series focuses on recreating the unique nuances of each of the 120 schools in the NCAA.  Playbooks, stadiums, mascots, traditional team strengths, tendencies, and even locker room rituals are included with as much accuracy as possible.  Games also use a complete ESPN broadcast package, including graphics, fly-ins, and replays. Broadcasters Kirk Herbstreit, Brad Nessler, and reporter Erin Andrews offer commentary and sideline updates throughout each game. The lighting engine has also been improved for all on-field conditions.\n\nGameplay improvements target A.I. and physics.  The Locomotion and Pro-Tak systems from the Madden series moves to NCAA in this release, basing the success of the running game and tackles more on physics and momentum, and less on arbitrary player stats.  Players can also use the analog sticks for precision running, with direction on the left, and spins, jukes, and stiff-arms on the right.  A.I. has been updated to run its assignments more effectively, and utilize new routes and concepts like double-blocking.\n\nAlso in <i>NCAA 11</i> is expanded use of social media and online integration.  Players can run all aspects of their Dynasty online, and keep up with their team's performance.  The Team Builder returns from NCAA Football 10 with expanded options; allowing players to go online and build a team from uniform color to on-field logo, and then share their teams online for public or private download.  Players can also use the StoryBuilder online feature to package clips, shots, and results from games into news stories that can be published on Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter.\n\nMultiplayer uses EA's Online Pass system, and requires a code from a new copy of the game, or one purchased through XBL/PSN, to use any of the online features.\n\n",

      "description": "<i>Apache Air Assault</i> is a helicopter flight simulation. The player takes control of an AH-64 combat helicopter and fulfills a variety of missions in three different scenarios. The settings include Eastern Europe, Africa and South America. Each scenario has a different storyline, revolving around the pilot and the gunner of each battleship.\n\nThe player's campaign missions usually consist of seek and destroy objectives, as well as the occasional air support deployments to protect allied vehicles and ground troops. The weapon load-out varies from helicopter to helicopter and includes guided hellfire missiles, hydra rockets, anti-air missiles and the built-in machine gun turret. The turret can be controlled either by an AI gunner, manually during flight or by switching to a black and white gun camera that includes an infrared view for better spotting of ground troops. Countermeasures against incoming missiles are available and deployed automatically. A great amount of decals can be unlocked by completing certain mission objectives or attempting higher difficulties. Four of these decals can be applied to each helicopter skin in the hangar.\n\nIn the multiplayer modes, players are able to fly Mil Mi-24 Hind and small helicopter drones as well. Various mission objectives exist that include races with aerial checkpoints and coop objectives, where one player controls a drone and marks target, while the other player flies the Apache and destroys the marked objects.",

      "description": "<i>City Rain</i> is a strategic, ecological city planning simulation combined with timed falling block puzzle gameplay. The game is set in a future where environmental challenges demand drastic measures. This led to the formation of the Rescue and Intervention Non-profit organization (R.A.I.N.), created by the World Environment Protection Agency to help maintain and enforce environmental laws, and confront multinational conglomerates. Players start as a new employee with R.A.I.N. With the help of Catherine, a partner who provides hints, the player is gradually introduced to increasingly difficult challenges.\n\nThe game environment is shown as an isometric board of tiles. In each stage the player needs to complete a number of goals, such as building specific structures, cleaning waste, or raising money for research. While the gameplay is similar to a simplified version of SimCity, a fast element is introduced. New buildings drop down from the top of the screen and the player only has a limited amount of time, but more than ten seconds, to select a location on the field. Each \"block\" can be rotated to choose between different buildings such as schools, residences, factories, hospitals, police stations, and more. Certain buildings can be stacked multiple times to upgrade their level. During certain turns the player is forced to drop down four buildings at once in a set pattern, due to planning regulations.\n\nEach decision by the player alters six main parameters: sustainability, jobs, health, leisure, security and education. Safeguarding security is for instance achieved by constructing police stations. Money is earned through the economy, but influenced by the chosen buildings. Residences and schools deduct money per round, while factories bring in revenue, but with ecological consequences. After a while, special buildings such as fire stations and recycling sites can be bought in a separate screen. The game's main campaign mode is divided into different levels. The player only has a limited amount of rounds to complete the challenges to progress. With each level, all previous work is generally reset.\n\nNext to the campaign mode, there is quick play where different starting parameters can be defined. The third mode, blockmania, does away with all missions. The player simply needs to build a city by quickly putting down buildings in defined patterns. The buildings can be rotated to upgrade existing ones, but overlapping a wrong one destroys it. When too many buildings are destroyed, the game is over. To score, buildings need to be upgraded until a certain amount is met.\n\nThis commercial version is a reworking of a student game. It contains a new story plot and dialogs, profile management, a music soundtrack, updated AI and gameplay changes, online scoreboards and customizable settings.",

The goal is of course to become formula one champion in a reasonable amount of seasons. Accomplishing the team manager's objective rewards experience points which in turn allows to upgrade the car. But racing is not the only thing the player needs to keep in mind: press interviews influence his reputation and becoming the first driver of the team means he has a higher saying in the team's strategic decisions. He may even choose to negotiate a contract with another team.\n\nBesides the full weekend with training, qualifying and the race there is also a shorter weekend available. In the workshop the player can tune his car or choose between pre-defined configurations.",

      "description": "<i>DiRt 3</i> is a rally racing game. Just like expected, most time is spent in races which, at least in most scenarios, are set in offroad environments. The main difference to other racing events is, that the player drives not alone, but has a front-seat passenger with him, who announces when to turn. The game features overall 98 courses, but some of those are just variations of the same. Also on board is the iconic ability to turn back time after screwing up.\n\nIn contrast to DiRt 2, in this installment there are other playing modes than the career available, e.g. a single race. But the career is still the heart of the game; here the player tunes his car, participates in races and earns experience points, which are used to unlock new cars. There are six different race modes to solve during the career; e.g. regular races and \"trailblazer\" (no passenger available). Two of those are newly introduced: drift tournaments and Gymkhana, which are basically confined areas with a lot of stunt opportunities - the goal is to perform as many as possible in a limited time. Additionally every mode has special tricky bonus goals which reward more experience when fulfilled.",

It is a movie karaoke game where players can act out 80 famous scenes from movies such as <i>300</i>, <i>The Matrix</i>, <i>The Godfather</i>, <i>Kindergarten Cop</i>, <i>Shaun of the Dead</i>, <i>The Terminator</i>, <i>Frankenstein</i>, <i>The Wizard of Oz</i> and many more. The game uses a rotoscoping technique to filter out the original actors and replace them with the player's image. The game requires a camera function through Kinect (Xbox 360) or PlayStation Eye (PS3) to capture the player, with optional support for Move on the PS3.\n\nThe player is put inside the scene and needs to imitate the original motions as well as speak out the lines. Players can either act out the scenes straight or improvise their own lines. The game grades the player based on the imitation of motion and gestures (a silhouette outlines where you should stand in the screen), as well as the rhythm of speaking the lines, similar to the SingStar games. In the Challenge mode there are additional goals while acting out the scenes. Clips can be saved and shared on the Yoostar website, as well as on Facebook and Twitter. Additional movie content is available as DLC.",

      "description": "<i>Pinball FX2</i> is an update to the Xbox 360 game Pinball FX. Upon release of this title, <i>Pinball FX</i> was de-listed and its tables made available as downloadable content (DLC) for the sequel. For the PC and Xbox One this is the first game in the series. The game works as a hub, allowing players to purchase and play downloadable tables. All tables can be played freely for a few minutes. They are permanently unlocked or added by purchasing them as DLC. Major updates from <i>Pinball FX</i> include a revised physics engine and various graphical updates. Tables have six to eight different view options, along with optional supplementary effects like floating points numbers, a ball trail, or a picture-in-picture skillshot camera showing the next target on the table. The table's active LED display is also shown within a window, and can be moved to one of the four corners of the screen. Separate windows appear when the player is close to specific milestones (such as a high score, beating a friend, or moving up in the leaderboard).\n\nPlayers use the left and right triggers to control the respective flippers. Balls are shot into play either using a mechanical trigger or an analog plunger.  You can also freeze the game and enter a free look mode, where they navigate a zoomed camera around the table to get a better sense of the layout. When this is activated high scores are not saved.\n\nAll tables include a rules sheet that explains each mini-game's activation criteria and goals. An authentic operator's menu (driven through the LED display) allows loading difficulty presets, run light, and sound tests on the virtual circuitry, reset each table's local high scores, and calibrate aspects of each table (such as flipper strength and tilt sensitivity). While most of the tables are grounded in reality and based on physical pinball parts, the virtual nature is occasionally used to do things physical tables could not - figures on the table move and interact with the ball, some tables have secondary modes (like a day-to-night cycle, or temporary zero gravity), and objects are sometimes flown into or out of the table.\n\nMultiplayer options include split-screen, simultaneous over internet, or local hot seat for up to four players. Ranked multiplayer uses fixed rules where the players have infinite balls and try to be the first to reach a target score or highest score in a time limit. Unranked multiplayer can be customized. Leaderboards are also driven by Superscores and Wizard Scores. A player's Superscore is the player's highest score on each table, rounded to the nearest million. A player's Wizard Score is their Superscore, plus the Superscore of anyone on their Friends list, times the number of tables they own. The system encourages interaction, competition, and of course, buying more tables.\n\nOn the Xbox 360 players who purchase the game as a Core pack (for 800 MSP) get four new tables: Biolab, Pasha, Rome, and Secrets of the Deep. On the Xbox 360 and also by default on PC, players can download the free version, play every table in a limited time trial mode, and/or purchase and play DLC tables. On Xbox 360 the <i>Pinball FX</i> Classic pack ports over Speed Machine, Agents, Buccaneer, and Extreme from the original game.  Each table has its own set of three achievements, usually tied to winning mini-games / missions. None of the core tables from <i>Pinball FX</i> or <i>Pinball FX2</i> are available for the PSN's Zen Pinball, though many of the DLC tables can be purchased for either. The PC and Xbox One versions contain the full and unrestricted table <i>Sorcerer's Lair</i> for free. For Xbox One tables previously purchased for the Xbox 360 version can be imported for free. The Xbox One version has a new overview system where tables (Marvel, Star Wars, etc.) are grouped together in separate tabs, along with a tab for all your purchased tables.",

      "description": "<i>Cabela's Big Game Hunter 2012</i> is an FPS-style hunting game where players partake in a hunting contest taking place at various locations around the world.  The game can be played with a standard controller, or with the Cabela's Top Shot Elite gun peripheral.  When played with a controller, the game operates in much the same way as a standard modern First-Person Shooter.  \n\nThe story is centered around a hunting tournament, in which the player is one of the participants.  Each level features three hunts with a variety of animals and challenges, as well as bonus challenges.  A hunt may include shooting a red deer, but the bonus may be to shoot it in the heart.  Each stage features ample chatter among the participants in the tournament, which is where the bulk of the story is told.  Hunts take place in areas all over the world, including Montana and Nigeria, and there are three levels pertaining to each location.\n\nBesides the Story Mode, there are a variety of shooting galleries listed as Arcade, Reflex, and Target.  Arcade is simply to score the highest points, Reflex is to hunt animals in a specific order, and Target galleries are simple shooting range style affairs with wooden \"pop-up\" animals and clay pigeons to shoot.",

      "description": "<i>The Price is Right: Decades</i> is a video game based on the popular TV show \"The Price is Right\".  It is the third \"Price is Right\" video game developed by Ludia Inc. for Wii and the first for Xbox 360, but the very first to allow players to play as their Mii characters/Xbox Avatars instead of Ludia avatars.  It is also the first game of the series that is completely rendered in 3D.\n\nThe game starts in a backstage lounge, where the player is asked to help the lovely Jessica, one of the \"beauties\" from the show, to go through a series of \"The Price is Right\" VHS tapes.  Jessica will put the tapes in the VCR and the player will be transported into the show, where he/she will bid on several items and compete against other players to win fabulous prizes and money.\n\nIn single player mode, the player will first go to Contestants' Row and bid on the selected item against 3 NPCs.  If the player's bid is the closest to that item's retail price, without going over, he/she will then go on to play a pricing game.  The player will then go to the Showcase Showdown to spin the wheel.  If the player beats the NPC's best score while spinning the wheel (by landing on the highest number, without going over 1$), he or she will then go to the Showcase, just like on the TV show.\n\nIn multiplayer mode, up to four players can compete against each other on Contestants' Row, pricing games, Showcase Showdown and the Showcase. The player with the most money wins.\n\n<i>The Price is Right: Decades</i> features pricing games from four different decades; the 70s, the 80s, the 90s and the 2000s decade.  Each decade's set from the TV show has been faithfully recreated in 3D.  There is one pricing game for every year the show has been on air, up until the year 2010. Among the included pricing games are Professor Price, Plinko, Hole in One, Golden Road, Spelling Bee, Rat Race, Pathfinder, and many others. The Xbox 360 version is also compatible with Kinect and features an online mode.",

      "description": "Family Feud: 2012 Edition is a video game based on the TV show \"Family Feud\".  It is the first Family Feud video game to be released on Xbox 360 and the third to be developed on Wii by Ludia Inc.\n\nIn Family Feud, one hundred people were surveyed and gave answers to various questions.  Two families then battle each other by trying to guess the top answers to each question.  In each round, a member of each family is asked to join the host on the center of the stage to answer one question.  The quickest player to buzz in gets to answer first.  If he/she doesn't give the number one answer, the other player can give his/her answer as well.  Whoever has the best answer will then decide to either \"play\" or \"pass\".  If the player decides to play, his/her family will have to guess all the answers to win the round.  If the player decides to pass, the opposing family will have to find all the answers.  \n\nEach wrong answer results in a strike.  After three strikes, the other family has a chance to steal the points.  To do so, they must find one correct answer that hasn't already been given.  When all the rounds are over, the family with the most points gets to play \"fast money\".   In \"fast money\", the player is asked to answer the five same questions twice (or in multiplayer mode, two players can each answer the set of five questions).  If the player gets 200 points or more in the \"fast money\" round, he/she wins $20 000!\n\nFamily Feud: 2012 Edition includes over 2000 survey questions, three difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard), a party mode with up to 4 players, bonus videos featuring Steve Harvey and lets the player play as his/her avatar on Xbox 360 or Mii on Wii.\n\nIn challenge mode, 1 to 4 players can play cooperatively against 16 different families.  Each family has its own themed alcove (a beach, a mansion, a spaceship, a prehistoric den, a haunted house, a private boat, a bowling alley, etc).  In party mode, 2 to 4 players can compete against each other.\n\nKinect features were developed for the game on Xbox 360, but were eventually dropped as they didn't add any fun factor to the game.  It was then decided to also port the game to Wii.",

      "description": "<i>NASCAR: Unleashed</i> is a racing game based on the US stock car racing sports event. Rather than a true simulation, it espouses realistic control, driving, and physics for much more hectic and over-the-top arcade racing, complete with many typical arcade racing features such as boosting and drifting, and the like. It has several features from both simulator-style racing games (e.g. NASCAR 09) and from arcade racing games (such as Burnout). Authentic NASCAR tracks are present in the game, but most \"break out\" from the track and into the surrounding city area, hence the \"Unleashed\" aspect. Pit lanes remain and are important for vehicle repairs and obtaining Slingshot boosts. A 15-driver \"All-Stars\" list of NASCAR drivers and their cars is present in the game, though all control identically. Drafting (lowering air resistance, and increasing speed by driving behind other cars) is also present.\n\nBesides drifting and boosting, the game features wild arcade-infused physics which often see cars barrel-rolling through the air, and collisions are rampant.  Cars can be wrecked and players will routinely create Rivals, who become much more aggressive opponent racers.  Should the player be wrecked, he has the ability to perform a Payback wreck on the Rival.\n\nThe boost meter is filled through extremely aggressive driving, slamming other cars, wrecking other cars, drifting, and drafting. Filling the boost meter gives the player the ability to use a Slingshot boost to race quickly around opponents, and the time limit on a boost tends to depend on the skill of a player to maintain the car around obstacles, walls, and other cars.\n\nChallenges routinely present themselves during each race. Completing challenges adds to the boost meter, and are occasionally part of secondary race challenges.  An in-race challenge may be as simple as reaching a certain position in the race or destroying obstacles on the tracks, or may require a bit more attention, such as creating Rivals or performing successful drifts.\n\nThe included game modes are:<ul>\n<li><i>Championship</i> - The standard career mode with three tiers of difficulty where the player progresses through several races with the goal of finishing within a specific place such as placing in the top 12 or top 5.  Each track features two secondary challenges such as creating a set number of Rivals or performing a set number of Drifts.  Can be played by one or two players.</li><br>\n<li><i>Quick Race</i> - Simple races that can be performed on any track, or in small, player-created career-style modes.  Only tracks unlocked in Championship mode can be used, and this mode can be played by one or two players.</li><br>\n<li><i>Time Trials</i> - The standard, basic Time Trial mode of a typical racing game.  The player only races against the clock, but there are several checkpoints available where boosts (Slingshots) can be obtained.</li></ul>",

      "description": "<i>F1 2011</i> is a racing game simulating the Formula 1 with the complete license for the season 2011. It is not an exact simulation like other games like Grand Prix Legends, but it still focuses more on the simulation side of the racing genre. Driving assists are available for inexperienced players.\n\nJust like with the predecessor, the heart of the game is the career mode in which the player begins with a smaller team and tries to work his way up to the top (the attention of bigger teams comes with personal successes, solving the current team's goals and careful interviews with the press). As \"headquarter\" serves the team truck in which the player can look up statistics or advance his personal career with contract negotiations. For every race the player can choose between several configurations or set various details himself. Other playing modes besides the career are a custom grand prix, time trials, time attack and multiplayer.\n\nThe main changes in comparison to <i>F1 2010</i> are the same as in the real-life formula one: two new courses, KERS (more speed for a short time) and DRS which is supposed to help during overtake manoeuvres. Other changes are safety cars, an overhauled AI, new graphical effects, slight changes with the press system and a co-op championship mode.",

      "description": "<i>Warriors of Rock</i> is the sixth main game in the rhythm game series. Similar to the previous games it focuses on the band experience, allowing up to four people to sing vocals, or play lead and bass/rhythm guitar, and drums. For the game's music selection this version returns to the series' roots with a less wide spectrum of genres and more focus on rock 'n roll songs.\n\nThe game's main career mode is called the Quest mode. It has players go through a campaign here they must defeat a mechanized creature called the Beast by helping save the Demigod of Rock. Players recruit characters by completing some songs in their genre. When successful, the character transforms into a warrior, receives a unique power, and is added to the band's roster. Other game modes are Quickplay+ and Party mode. In the latter one or multiple players go through different songs like in a jukebox, with the ability to drop in or out at any time. The Wii version adds DS functionality with the Roadie mode as introduced in the previous version of the game. It has been expanded to three different game modes and supports up to eight players simultaneously. New abilities for the roadies are now for instance to throw powers at the different players (as unlocked in the Quest mode) to help or sabotage them.\n\nAll previously bought tracks for other games in the series can also be played in this version.",

Instead of simply riding, players participate in an adventure based on the film world represented in that attraction. For example, instead of sitting in a flying boat on the Peter Pan attraction, the character flies in a mini-game with Peter Pan.\n\nThe Park ties together the different games in each attraction. Players interact with Disney characters like Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Goofy, Dumbo, Cinderella - 40 characters in all. Unlike the games, this is more of an open world where the player's avatar can hug the characters, take pictures with them, get clues and be sent on adventures. In addition to the characters, ordinary objects like trash cans, water fountains, and statues come alive and interact with players.\n\nKDA is a combination of the games in the attractions and the open world that connects them where players meet objectives, perform tasks and get rewards from the characters.",

      "description": "<i>Game Time</i> is the follow-up to Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?: Make the Grade and it is based on the concept of the TV show where contestants try to prove they are smarter than fifth graders. Players must answer a series of question and pick a 5th grade partner to fall back on when they need help. The questions are grouped in categories from first grade to fifth grade. Every question leading up to the final is multiple choice and there are also bonus questions and mini-games. The answer to the very last question always needs to be spelled out, making it a little more challenging.\n\nNext to the main game modes, interspersed with dialogues between each question, there is the Homeroom challenge where the game can be played with a group. In Battle of Wits the questions are asked quickly in successions and players can earn bonuses to sabotage other players. In Three and Out players need to buzz in rapidly and after three incorrect answers the game is over.\n\nThe Xbox 360 version supports online multiplayer.",
