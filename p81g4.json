      "description": "What if Hitler never existed? Einstein pondered the question and created a time-machine to eliminate Hitler as a young man, thus preventing World War II as history remembers it. However, Einstein stopped one evil only to create another - because Stalin's Soviet Union is now poised to conquer Europe... and Allies must stop them!\n\n<i>Command & Conquer: Red Alert</i> can be considered a prequel to Command & Conquer. Like its predecessor, it is a real-time strategy with an isometric semi-top-down perspective using 2D sprite graphics engine. The player takes control of either the Allies or the Soviets, as he battles for destiny of the planet. Gameplay features are similar to those of the previous game, including building a base with some defenses, massing units, harvesting resources, etc. The game has a variety of environments in its missions, adding some indoor missions that use only infantry units.",

Nuclear grenades and psycho gas are among the new weapons. Tubes, a monorail system and unimpeded Antigrav vehicles give a futuristic feel to travel.

You can now give names to places, and your city is surrounded by neighboring towns with which you can make trade. Finally, instead of the poll in the first game you now have the option of reading several newspapers to get an idea of your progress.",

      "description": "<i>Populous: The Beginning</i> is the third part of the Populous series originally created by Peter Molyneux. This is the first part with 3D graphics. Gameplay also received a major overhaul; the player no longer simply has to lower and raise land to gain bigger houses which can defend themselves stronger. Now the player has to chop trees to build your huts. Depending on how many men are in the house, the faster its population and the house itself grows. It's possible to train men as fighters, priests, etc. New spells can be added to the shaman's spell inventory through the act of prayer at shrines scattered all over the world. Most spells take the form of natural disasters such as tornadoes and volcanic eruptions.\n\nEach level is represented by a tiny planet that the player can scroll around freely. Aside from the single player campaign it's also possible to challenge other players online.",

There several additional rooms, such as a staff room for your employees to rest, a toilet so that patients don't have to relieve themselves in the corridors, a research department to get the most advanced diagnostic and treatment technologies and a training room where consultants can teach a thing or two to rookies, making them capable doctors. The size and layout of each room can be set by the player, according to the available space. In addition to rooms, the player must provide radiators, seating for patients and drink machines.\n\nHowever, rooms don't run by themselves. Most diagnostic and clinics can work with regular doctors, but others like the operating theater and the research room require specialized staff while the ward, pharmacy and the fracture clinic require an attending nurse. At the same time, the hospital can't run without handymen cruising around the hospital to water up dry plants, clean up litter and vomit (after all, people go there because they <i>are</i> sick) and fix machines, while receptionists direct patients to the proper rooms.\n\nAs levels advance, the player faces increasingly harder situations: VIP visits, emergencies, epidemics and earthquakes, which can either take a toll on reputation or on the bank account. On the other hand, as more and more equipment is required, additional plots of land are available for purchase in later maps.",

The first task is to set up your rides within the available land, structuring convenient paths and queues and ideally leaving some space for bigger rides once they become available, and include some lakes and trees to increase the park's allure. Rides range from Teacups and Haunted Houses to the biggest most elaborate roller-coaster you can design, and water rides that loop around other rides.\n\nShops must also be included, so that the visitors can buy food, drinks and souvenirs - the cunning player will combine salt, sugar and caffeine settings to maximize consumer interest. Staff must be hired to keep everything running smoothly, and they will only work for what they consider a fair rate of pay.\n\nYou are competing against other Theme Parks, so don't let them get an advantage over you - monitor your success in attracting customers and financial viability closely using the supplied statistics pages. More important, ensure that research is adequately funded to produce new rides.\n\nIt can be played in three modes - Sandbox level lets you concentrate on the park design elements, while Sim and Full add more strategic features.",

      "description": "Three years ago a brilliant scientist disappeared while researching a new form of energy. The government that funded his research wrote the whole affair off as a loss, which made it all the more upsetting when reports of Dr. Kirk's good health and nearly finished research came in. A special forces team is sent to the doctor's private island laboratory to extract him and his research, but they are totally unprepared for some of the side effects of his developments. Side effects that come from 100 million years in the past.\n\n<i>Dino Crisis</i> is a survival horror game that is very similar in both control and gameplay to its sister series, Resident Evil. As in that series, protagonist Regina will have limited supplies and ammo with which to fight deadly enemies while searching rooms for keys (some figurative, some literal) to open locked areas. Unlike <i>Resident Evil</i> games, Regina will find very few actual supplies laying around, and will instead find \"plugs\" that are used to open caches of emergency supplies located around the complex. There are only enough plugs to open some of these caches, however, so care must be taken to decide what items are really needed. In another change from <i>Resident Evil</i>, the game is rendered in 3D, allowing the camera to rotate or pan, although camera angles are still out of the control of the player. Even the dumbest dinosaur is smarter than the undead, and enemies can chase and disarm Regina, and even occasionally follow her through doors. Regina can use the force fields in the complex to block her enemies.",

From there, taking advantage of their fast reproduction rate, the player can train new workers, and as soon as three different wooden huts are available, the council will allow the construction of a cement yard, which in turn allow the construction of better buildings. However, slobs wouldn't appreciate living in such luxury, and so a gadget factory can be built so that computers are distributed to their houses, allowing for a new generation of better educated citizens. \nWhile the workers pack a nasty punch when in a large group, violence should be left to the professionals. After building a Pizza Parlor, the player is allowed to use the services of gangsters. These are able to take on that pesky foreman or that building the Council asked to get rid off.\n\nBut there's more to the game than build from ghetto houses to luxury buildings, and as they say, all is fair in war, and construction IS war. The player can send his foremen to capture other teams' buildings, or do even worse: provide housing for the scum of society. From hippies to ghosts, these can do a number on the other teams' properties. Want to stress out a tenant? Send the thugs to do a wild party in their house. Need some cash or materials? Send the thief to relieve a team from them. All this while avoiding the others do the same on you by assigning police patrol to key areas. \nAs time passes, it pays out to build other, more friendly, buildings. A school allows everyone to breed more civilized members of the society, the hospital allows recovery of wounds much faster or the park, where everyone goes to relax a little, among others. Improving the rooms and giving them garden furniture is also a good way of keeping tenants happy, but jealously can grow among neighbors. Failing to comply to tenants requests and demands will quickly turn the Council against the player.\n\nThe player will have to balance the output of their tenants to achieve success: overdoing one of the elements will take a dent on the bank account (leading to bankruptcy), cut the arrival of new workers (putting a strain of existing teams), replacement for deceased tenants (leaving houses vacant that eventually decay into a flaming pile of rubble not before giant cockroaches settle in) or police and mob favors (to patrol areas against undesirables and gangster actions). \n\nThe difficulty level affect what maps can be selected, but also which  actions the undesirables can perform. To choose higher difficulty settings, more computer players (up to three) must be activated.",

      "description": "Yokosuka, Japan, 2112 AD. The young student Kazuki Takemura works as a test pilot with Kirishima Industries, a production company of military battle wanzers (walking panzers), mechanized walking robots with movement similar to that of a human being. Kazuki has just finished testing the combat capabilities of the new Zeinslev prototype in the lab. Finishing his day's tasks he is asked by his best friend Ryogo to help with a company delivery to the Japanese Defense Force (JDF) military based. This simple choice determines where Kazuki is when strange things begin happening in Japan. A large explosion, a wanzer theft, his sister Alysia being hunted, rumors of a powerful weapon, and accusations of involvement by agents of both the OCU and the USN all make the situation more complicated. Kazuki is swept up in a plot of conflicting loyalties and attacked by various factions. He will need to recruit additional characters and wanzers in order to be victorious in battle and investigate leads to uncover what is going on.\n\n<i>Front Mission 3</i>, like other games in the Front Mission Series is a turn-based strategy game featuring real-time environments, CG movies, mechanized robots and strategic battles. The game contains two independent storylines with different situations, environments and unique characters made up of different set of allies and enemies. The majority of the game takes place on the battlefield where Kazuki and his allies are controlled in an overhead view 3D environment. The game is tactical and nature, so the player chooses his unit and assigns where it will be moved and what action it will perfom. Typical actions include attacking with a shoulder weapon (missiles or gernades), attacking with a weapon held in the hand (ranged and melee), using items, guarding against future attack and simply ending the turn. As chaarcters fire weapons back and forth at each other, they will inflict damage to different parts of the wanzer. Areas that can be damaged and destroyed/disabled include arms, legs, and body. Complete damage to the body will 'destroy' the wanzer in battle, whereas disabling other parts will merely render it less effective. Each weapon has a damage type which includes (I) \"Impact\", (F) \"Flame\" and (P) \"Piercing\". In practice these types function as weapon \"elements\" which can be reduced with the proper armor coating, however it usually renders it vulnerable to another damage type. Typically Anti-I defense is very weak against Class-P attack and defending against that is weak from Class-F and defending against that is weak from Class-I. Each weapon carried by the wanzers is also classified as either Ranged, Melee, Shield or Missile . Each pilot can have a proficiency in these skills, making the usage of some weapons by them more effective than others. Pilots also learn special skills during battle, these are activated by experience points, and amount of weapon usage. Special abilities are very dependent on the types of actions being performed and items equipped, so for example the ability \"Double Shot\" requires a weapon equipped in each hand of the same weapon class.\n\nBetween combat missions, Kazuki is able to save his game as well as explore the \"network\". The network is a virtual internet, allowing connections to the (completely fictional) websites of organizations involved in the <i>Front Mission 3</i> plot. While exploration on the network is not required, it's exploration will uncover clues to some of the game's backstory as well as open up the opportunity to develop email contacts, obtain additional funds and unlock new wanzer gear.\n\nBetween certain missions, Kazuki will enter a town. These are represented by a simple graphical menu of different locations. Areas that can be visited typically include Pubs, Wanzer Equipment Shops, Wanzer Parts Shops and specific locations. Wanzers are mix-and-matchable so that feet from one model can be attached to another and different weapons carried. Different wanzer parts each have unique values for HP, accuracy, movement and armor. However each part and weapon has a \"weight\" value, which is determined by each individual Wanzer model's engine (as well as additional parts). A wanzer is always unable to carry more than it's maximum weight. Towns are also where Kazuki will often meet new characters and have conversations to uncover the plot.",

      "description": "<i>Final Fantasy Tactics</i> was a big move for the whole Final Fantasy franchise into different fields. Tactics combines traditional elements of the Final Fantasy series with a completely different game mechanics and battle system. It was the 1st game during the Final Fantasy 32-bit era using a 3D, isometric, rotatable playing field, with bitmap sprite characters and a turn based strategy system.\n\nIn the game you build up a team by recruiting many available characters you meet during your travels and stocking up plenty of items, to defeat various enemies waiting on your path. The game features a very complex character class(job) system where each character begins his way with a job such as Squire or Chemist. Successfully participating in battles, characters can later select one of more advanced jobs, with a total of 19 to choose from. In addition there are certain monsters and computer controlled \"guests\" with their own jobs and special abilities available to learn. In total, over 400 abilities are available which leads to nearly endless combinations.\n\nThe PSP version of the game mostly reiterates the original for the PSOne. Visual presentation is almost a 1:1 copy, looking like the old version with a zoomed-in camera to make it fit the PSP screen. Port developer Tose added cel-shaded introduction movies and numerous animation sequences played after each chapter ends. Some maps were completely remade as well, but you still cannot skip event scenes.\n\nAlso the PSP version features two new playable characters: Balthier, from Final Fantasy XII and Luso from Final Fantasy Tactics A2. Two new job classes have been added - the completely new Onion Knight and the Dark Knight class which was available on the PSOne only after using a cheat code. There are two wireless multiplayer options available once you've reached the world map (just go into a bar in any town). One is Coliseum (Versus Battle Mode), the second is Cooperative Challenge (team mission).",

      "description": "It is a time of war. Many leaders from different factions fight to control their land. One such leader, Liu Bei, has only one wish: peace. But war stands in his way, after his land Shu is attacked by the kingdom of Wei, led by the warlord Cao Cao, who abducts Liu Bei's beloved Diao Chan, the keeper of the Imperial Seal. Liu Bei has to flee, but swears to return, exact revenge on Cao Cao, and liberate the kingdom of Shu.\n\n<i>Kessen II</i> is a real-time strategy game, and a follow-up to Kessen. Unlike the first game, it is set in the Chinese Three Kingdoms period. The account of historical events is heavily fictionalized in the game, liberally adding new sub-plots (such as the entire romance angle of the story) and supernatural elements. The player can choose to command the armies of either Liu Bei or Cao Cao in their respective scenarios.\n\nThe gameplay is similar to that of the previous game, the most notable change being the shift to supernatural warfare, including the addition of magical attacks such as tornadoes, lightning strikes, earthquakes, meteor showers, etc.  The player can now control 500 units at one time, as opposed to 100 in the previous game. New unit types (elite horsemen, elephant cavalry, etc.) have been added.",

      "description": "About 1800 years ago in China, there were three fearless warriors battling for ultimate control over the country. One who sought hegemony. One who sought ambition. One who stood up for righteousness. Veterans who shared the same swarmed under each leader.  These stalwart souls waged war across the vast expanse of the land and, like blood thirsty demons, cut down any and all who stood in their way.\n\nThey followed their own rules, they were both revered and feared by millions... they are the Dynasty Warriors.\n\n<i>Dynasty Warriors 3</i> takes place over the 50 years of war recounted in <i>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</i>, from the first flames of battle in the Yellow Turban Rebellion to the final battle between Wei and Shu on the plains of Wu Zhong. Over 40 characters are playable, both from the three main sides as well as leaders of lesser armies along the way. Each character that belongs to either Wu, Wei, or Shu has their own series of levels where they will turn the tide of battle for their force to win. Each character has their own unique weapon type and magic ability, although they can share weaker variations of weapons with other characters who use the same style of weapon. Weapons and items are dropped randomly from boxes in levels as well as from defeated enemy generals, and each has a range of stats dependent on the difficulty level and the strength of the general. The most powerful weapons and items, however, can only be collected by completing hidden objectives as each character. Characters grow more powerful by collecting stat up items from defeated generals, and doing well in levels rewards points that level up the bodyguards who follow the player character.\n\nMost completed levels can be replayed with any character and any side in free mode. An encyclopedia is included as well that details every event and character from the <i>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</i>, even those that never appear in <i>Dynasty Warriors 3</i>.",

      "description": "Once upon a time, there was a prince who wanted nothing else out of life but marry his sweetheart Fiana and live happily ever after. But his fate took an unexpected turn when his malicious brother Yurias killed their father, the king, and framed the prince for murder in order to get Fiana for himself. Possessed by despair, the prince's soul could not rest in peace. The prince made a pact with Satan himself, and was given the Castle of the Damned, where he would set traps to capture souls, grow stronger, and eventually get his revenge...\n\n<i>Deception</i> is a first-person perspective game that has elements of strategy and role-playing. The main activity in the game is setting traps for those who dare to venture into the castle, which requires magic points. Captured invaders can be dealt with in various ways. They can be released, killed, or have their soul devoured. The game registers the prince's deeds with a morality system: killing innocent people who just happen to be inside the castle would lower the morality level of the protagonist. Devouring the souls increases the hero's parameters, similarly to experience points in RPGs. Money can be obtained from corpses and spent on expanding the castle. Body parts can be used to create and summon monsters, who would help the owner to stop invaders. ",

      "description": "The race of Timenoids was once human, but long time ago, they have traded their human souls for immortality. The humans perceive them as demons, and invade their country. Fearing that they might lose the war, the Timenoids brainwash a human girl named Millennia, effectively turning her into a tool to serve their purposes. They put her in charge of defending their castle by entrapping the human invaders. But Millennia has yet to choose whose side she will eventually be on...\n\n<i>Kagero: Deception II</i> is the sequel to Tecmo's Deception. It follows a similar, hard-to-classify gameplay style, which can be perhaps defined as a real-time strategy game with RPG elements. Instead of commanding troops and units, Millennia has to place traps and activate them to prevent the intruders from conquering the castle. Unlike the first game, <i>Kagero: Deception II</i> is played from a third-person perspective. A major addition to the gameplay is the introduction of \"trap combos\": traps can be positioned in such a way that they will trigger each other, leading to powerful combinations that would harm the invaders more. The game also allows to customize traps and use various materials to build new ones. As before, the main character and her traps grow in power in correspondence with the amount of enemies killed, lending the game a RPG flavor.\n\nThe morality system also present in this sequel, as the player can decide for Millennia whom to kill and whom to spare. Eventually, the player will be able to choose to join either the Timenoids or the humans.",

After escape, she must try to survive while helping the people that helped her. Her persecutors have interest in a mysterious gem brooch she owns, which gives her the power of controlling traps (pendulums, bombs, claws, arrows, and other lethal traps). \n\nThis is the third game in the Deception series. You control the character in a 3D environment in which you place traps to kill your persecutors (who have weapons). It's a real-time game with elements of strategy and role-playing, which allows you to use a system of timing and skill of activating traps through the rooms of a medieval castle as the opponents try to kill you. As you activate the traps, you can link them to activate each other, in way to increase the number of combos.\n\nDepending on how you kill your opponents, and how many of them, determines how much \"Ark\" (money) you get to develop better traps. They can be created by using ancient black magic: emblems (fire, ice, thunder, poison, etc.), orbs (that improve the power of the trap) and rings (automatic, charge, damage, zero, etc.). \n\nThere are many other traps set over the environment, working automatically out of control of the player (spears, spikes, fans, etc.). They also can be used to increase the damage inflicted at the invaders. The game features over 2000 different traps, four modes of play (story, mission, training, license), trap element system (linking traps), and multiple endings that change according the choices you take through the story mode.",

Not willing to give up his rightful place as the next king, Laharl joins with his subordinate Etna and her underlings to fight back.\n\nThe Overlord's castle acts as a hub to manage the party. It has shops to get new equipment, a gate to the different battles, a NPC to travel to the Item World, which is used to boost items, and the Dark Assembly, where the player can create new units, and have the assembly vote to pass (or not) special laws that will affect the game. To unlock some characters, a special chapter must first be unlocked by the Assembly.\n\nThe story progresses in the form of chapters. In each chapter, new battles become one after another, with dialogues at the beginning and end of those battles. Any completed battle becomes available to play again, sometimes with minor changes. At the end of every chapter, a parody cut-scene announcing the next chapter,(most often, it is Etna who tells the story as if she were the protagonist) is shown.\n\n<b>Battle</b><ul>\nIn a similar style to Final Fantasy Tactics and Ogre Battle, <i>Disgaea</i> is a turn-based strategy RPG on an isometric grid. Characters are dispatch in battle one after another, and each have a move action and an battle action. Each class has its own set of abilities, ranging from simple attacks and area attacks to magics that can affect all the battlefield. In each battle, up to ten bonuses can be obtained by clearing the Geo Panels and defeating enemies to fill the Bonus Gauge. The battle is won when all enemies are defeated, or, in the Item World, by accessing a gate to move to the next floor.\n</ul>\n\n<b>The Item World</b><ul>\nThe Item World is a world divided in floors, inside any of the player's item. The goal of the Item World is to progress through the floors, which raises the item's level. The more enemies are defeated before moving to the next floor, the more the item will improve. A special king of enemies, Residents, can be found in the Item World. These have their own level, and add a bonus to the item in which they reside. Once a Resident is defeated, it is \"subdued\", its level doubles and it can be moved between items. Residents can be fused together to get better bonuses. This is necessary because each item has a maximum number of Residents it can contain, determined by the item's rarity (common, rare or legendary) .</ul>\n\n",

      "description": "The sequel to Dynasty Tactics gives the player more tactics to choose from, and introduces some new characters and features.\n\nLike in the first game, the player assumes the role of 3 important leaders in ancient China: Cao Cao, Liu Bei and Sun Ce. A new choice is the warrior Lu Bu.\nThe characters have their own, unique story paths, which are affected by choices and outcomes occurring during the chapters the game is divided into. The player organizes and moves his officers and armies over the map while engaging others, trying to fulfill certain objectives during a turn limit.\n\n For battles, the game switches from the map to a dedicated screen showing the battlefield. The battle system is a bit like chess: the player moves the units around the battlefield in a turn-based fashion, mostly trying to bring them in a position to pull off special tactics. Ideally, this results in effective combos, that may not only defeat enemy units, but also capture the leading officers, which may join the player (there are over 200 in the game). \n\nMorale and terrain need to be taken into consideration as well. Units have different abilities depending on their type and position in the army, Engineers may build useful installments like supply depots for example. Army strategists can use the link command retained from the previous game for pinning down enemy units and helping to rack up higher combos, in addition, they may order chains now. These allow individual officers to perform multiple tactics (provided the conditions are met for each of them), but cost morale. \n\nThe game also contains a two player versus mode, which consists of random battles.",

Kukuru must marry a man she doesn't love, and in order to avoid this marriage, she accepts the offer of the mayor: he asks her to extinguish the flame. As a result, the spirit awakes and threatens to destroy the world. A young adventurer named Arc arrives to the village at the same moment as Kukuru is standing frightened in front of the spirit. Arc immediately recognizes it - it was the murderer of his father! Before he realizes how that could be possible, the spirit disappears, and now Arc and Kukuru have to do everything in their powers to undo the error, to stop the spirit, and perhaps to avenge the death of Arc's father.\n\n<i>Arc the Lad</i> is a hybrid of traditional and strategy-based Japanese-style RPGs. The story unfolds as you are transported from location to location and enter battles - you don't walk around on the world map, choosing yourself which location to visit. The battles take place on a battle field, on which you can move and attack only when you approach the opponent.",

      "description": "<i>Vanguard Bandits</i> is a tactical RPG that takes place on the continent of Eptina, which has been at war with itself for years until the kingdom of Pharastia discovers ancient mechanical giants created by a lost civilization. With the new found mecha's called ATAC (All Terrain Armored Combatant) Pharastia once again brings peace to Eptina until civil wars and coup d' etat's took place and thus began the Second Eptina Wars. Take control of Bastion as he wages war against the Junaris Empire to regain control of the continent. \n\nGameplay consists of controlling a group of ATAC on missions on a 2D sprite map where players take turns moving and attacking. Once a fight between two ATAC's starts the game is switched to a 3D side view and the battle between the two continues. Use the terrain to your advantage like attacking from above or behind your enemy. \n\nFollow the story of Bastion and his friends on 56 missions to regain peace on the continent. Your actions before battles and as the results of battles will decide your outcome - with 5 different endings along three separate story lines.",

      "description": "Dynasty Warriors 4: Empires is a strategy-oriented variant of Dynasty Warriors 4, mixing it with gameplay similar to Romance of the Three Kingdoms. The heart of the game, campaign mode, begins by choosing any of 24 regions and 42 rulers (custom characters can be created). Beginning with a small kingdom, the ultimate goal is the conquering of all others. Each turn, the player is given a choice from 4 different governing options (brought to your attention by your generals) followed by a single decision of action. These actions typically include the invasion or defense of a specific province or the option to aid an allied empire with those same actions.\n\nIn any battle, be it offense or defense, the player chooses up to three generals and three lieutenants and their troops to form the army. Soldiers fill the battlefield with different ranks and styles (normal, archers, guards, sorceresses and 2 types of siege weapons) as well as horses which can be riden. The player, in 3rd person perspective, may guard, parry, attack, charge, fire arrows, jump, announce or charge up to unleash a special musou attack. All generals and lieutenants are displayed on the map and may be attacked or challenged. Enemy characters who are defeated enough times in a battle can be challenged to a duel. The obvious goal of the battlefield is to control strongholds at strategic points that will make it easier to defend or reach a certain area or opponent. At any given time, these stronghold areas are under control of either of the two sides. They are won by defeating all of the opposing forces in the immediate area. Strongholds routinely generate health recovery items. The winner of a offensive action can win territory and capture enemy soldiers. Each province under control of an empire nets that empire 100 gold each turn which may be spent on various governing decisions.\n\nThe game also features a 2-player mode where players compete against one another in 4 different styles: Defeat more enemies (Vanquish), Collect more treasure (Pilfer), Knock more enemies off a wall (Melee) and a test of survival (Endurance). The game also features unlockable art galleries and data that can be imported from either Dynasty Warriors 4 or Dynasty Warriors 3: Xtreme Legends.",

This fog devours everything on its way, and is slowly moving towards the few remaining towns and villages, about to consume the rest of humanity. The main religion of this world, Aeque, preaches that this is the will of God, and that the human beings should not resist and allow themselves to extinct. But an underground rebel movement is trying to dispel the fog with a magical structure called Gate of Eternity. Spero, the young protagonist of the game, must find his place amidst the conflict between the Empire he serves and the rebels.\n\n<i>Stella Deus</i> is a tactical role-playing game. You command your units by moving them around the isometric battle view. Each action -  whether movement, physical attack, or magic spell - requires action points (AP). After the battles, your characters gain levels and get new abilities. Outside of battle, you can tackle the huge optional dungeon, Catacomb of Trials, and access towns via the menu. In towns you can fuse items to obtain more powerful ones, and receive side quests which mostly involve going to a certain place on the map and participating in a battle there.",

      "description": "Front Mission is a strategy RPG set in a futuristic world. This is a remake of Front Mission. Various organizations are trying to gain power through military assaults, piloting huge robots which are the main means of combat in those days. A war between the USN (United States of the New Continent and the OCU (Oceana Community Union) begins because of the so-called Larcus Incident. Huffman Island, a location with important weapon factories, is infiltrated by USN people under the leadership of commander Driscoll. Driscoll causes an explosion that blows the factory off, and puts the blame on the OCU soldier, Roid. A year later, Roid makes a living with his robot in the arena when he is approached by a mysterious man from the OCU. Embarking across Huffman Island, now controlled by the OCU, Roid receives a mission to investigate the USN forces recently sighted.\n\nIn Front Mission, you progress in the story through large strategic battles and cutscenes between them, although at certain places you can also visit locations and talk to people. In combat, you fight inside the robots, and have a large variety of weapons and attack styles at your disposal. You get experience for defeating enemies and also for using various techniques - the more you use an attack, the more powerful it becomes. You can also learn and upgrade various skills. \n\nThe game features better sound and music, updated backgrounds and graphics, and an entire new scenario that allows you to play as on the side of the U.S.N.",

      "description": "<i>Conflict: Vietnam</i> is the third game in Pivotal Games' Conflict Series this time taking you further back in time to the bloody battleground of Vietnam. The game is set during the Tet offensive in the year 1968.\n\nYou take over the role of four soldiers who aren't, contrary to previous games, elite S.A.S / Delta Force soldiers. In fact, they are normal American G.I. who are separated from their unit during battle  and have to fight themselves through enemy territory with hordes of hostile Vietnamese.\n\nYou can issue orders to every member of your squad or directly take control over one of them. In every mission you have one or more main and several bonus aims like destroying all tanks in  the area or collecting Vietcong documents. For each achieved objective, killed soldier or destroyed vehicle your soldiers get experience points. Each soldier has different abilities (Sniper, Leader, Heavy Weapons, Medic) which can be improved with these points. To defuse one of the numerous booby traps it is necessary to have skills in that ability.\n\nThe levels are set around the jungle and include underground Vietcong complexes or temples. You don't only meet enemies but also friendly persons like own soldiers or citizens with which you can talk and which sometimes give you bonus objectives. Furthermore, in some missions you can use stationary weapons like machine guns and drive jeeps or tanks.\n\nThe console versions of <i>Conflict: Vietnam</i> feature a split-screen multiplayer co-op mode with up to four players (Xbox) resp. two players (PS2). The PC version doesn't have this feature.",

      "description": "In <i>Trapt</i>, the player takes on the role of Princess Allura, horrified by the sudden murder of her father the King of Fronenburg and worse, being framed for his murder by step mother - Queen Catalina, later forced unwillingly to flee the castle with her maid Rachel.\n\nFleeing her pursuers, she takes refuge in a forbidden castle, known through rumors as the place where an evil being only known as 'the Fiend' was imprisoned. It was not by coincidence she was led here, as it turns out she was chosen by the Fiend to become her servant and wielder of the evil power the Fiend possesses. This power transforms the once innocent princess into a brutal Trapmaster capable of summoning and activating traps at will to the unwary enemy.\n\nThe game starts in this castle and the unfolding of this new-found power as well as the attempts of Princess Allura and her allies in thwarting the plans of Queen Catalina.\n\n<i>Trapt</i> is set in medieval and most of the gameplay is located in and around castle rooms, though not specifically limited to the aforementioned castle. Gameplay of <i>Trapt</i> consists of the following:\n<ul><li><b>Traps/Info Screen</b><br>\nIn this section the player has access to various important information to prepare for the upcoming mission/story, such as traps and items that may be bought (providing there is enough money), upcoming enemies and their stats in the next mission, and room information of areas available for access in addition to what traps are already located there.\n\n<li><b>Real-Time Combat</b><br>\nThis is where the real game play occurs, third person perspective view of the character and her surroundings. Most of the game play consists killing off enemies by placing traps to the unwary pursuer. The Princess cannot fight personally (only run) so the player has to rely on the traps to survive.</ul>\nUnlike other similar games with a trap system, in <i>Trapt</i> the traps are not automatically set. The player have to activate them manually by pressing the appropriate triggers (via buttons) to activate the traps. The three different button/triggers represent three different traps: floor traps, ceiling traps, and wall traps. These are the only traps the player has direct access to.\n\nOther traps or devices are also located in the many rooms. The player can link/connect them with other traps to create combos at the displeasure of the enemy. The more combos, the more money the player acquires, of which means the more traps the player can purchase for future planning.\n\nPlacing traps can be done at any point during this real-time setting, which is basically the uniqueness of your powers. This means the player may move and place traps around, even when the enemy is chasing the player. However, traps have to recharge: after it is placed and after it is sprung, so timing is also crucial here.",

You and Flo build a restaurant empire through 50 levels in five different restaurants of seating customers, taking their orders, serving their food, and cleaning up after them. Speedy service and good atmosphere is needed to keep the customers happy, and keeping them happy is the best way to get huge tips.\n\nThe player must balance service for the five different customer types, each with their own quirks. For example, the business lady is very impatient, but eats very fast and gives very big tips, while the senior citizen is extremely patient, slow to eat, and cheap (he's got to save his retirement money, after all). There are also two chain systems to keep track of, a service chain for doing the same service multiple times in a row, and a seating chain for seating customers of the same color in the same seat.\n\nThe Wii, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 versions support multiplayer games - cooperative, competitive (with tip wars for instance, where the first player to reach a certain amount of tips, wins), and team based with up to 8 players.",

Each general has its own army with its strengths and weakness as well as unique magic powers, plus many generals have feuds or alliances with other generals so you must consider weaker but friendlier generals that allow you to form alliances.\n\nFor the PS2 re-release new polygonal elements have been introduced (such as a 3D world map) and the original 2D artwork has been cleaned up. New quests, characters and items have been included and the 2D cutscenes have been completely redone with complete voiceovers.",

      "description": "In Sam Fisher's first next generation adventure, the splinter cell has a tragedy befall him.  Shortly thereafter, Sam's life collapses around him.  He becomes more distant from Third Echelon.  In fact, he even goes so far as to get himself arrested.\n\nBut it's all part of the plan.  Sam Fisher is now a double agent, working for both the NSA and a terrorist organization known as the JBA, or John Brown's Army.  Sam is for the most part a good guy still.  But will that remain?  Will Sam do good for the NSA and bring the organization to justice, or will the lure of the terrorist group overpower and overcome Sam?\n\nThe choices you make affect that outcome.  Moral questions will pop up in various places throughout the game.  Do you shoot a prisoner to earn trust with the JBA, or do you hold off, keeping the NSA on your side?  Whatever outcome you decide on, your trust with one will go down and the other will go up.  This trust system is a new addition to Double Agent.\n\nAs you work your way through ten missions, your best friends are shadow and silence.  You can go in guns blazing, but you won't get far.  As a master spy, Sam will have to sneak around crates and walls, hide under vehicles and tables, sneak through highly guarded areas, and bypass electronic, fingerprint, voiceprint and retinal locked doors.  You must interrogate or hack for keycodes and combinations, and you have the choice of knocking an enemy unconscious or killing them.  When hanging by a rail, you can let an enemy guard walk by, or reach up, grab him and throw him to his death.  Your best weapon is your mouth.  Lure an enemy to your location by whistling, then sneak around him as he abandons his patrol to find the source of the noise.  Your configurable weapon is really a backup.\n\nSam will go on many missions as a double agent.  You'll be visiting the JBA headquarters in New York City, you'll travel to the Congo to rescue a soldier, you'll board a cruise ship in Cozumel wearing shorts in broad daylight with minimal cover, forcing you to change your stealth patterns.  You'll wind up in the middle of a wartorn city, in the middle of a battle between guerrillas and the military, both of which want you dead.  Your missions are varied, and all can be completed without firing a single bullet.\n\nMultiplayer is similar to the past Splinter Cell games.  You take on the role of either a spy or a mercenary; spies are played from the standard, third-person perspective, while mercs are played from the first-person perspective.  Spies are tasked with stealing sensitive documents; mercs are tasked with killing the spies and protecting the documents.  Each side has its own unique weapons and items.  Spies do not have conventional weaponry, meaning nothing that can kill a merc, but they have several gadgets and devices to help them.  Mercs are blessed with a high-powered rifle, grenades, and the ability to toggle various vision modes.\n\nThe PS3 version includes some additional content: a new female spy character (multiplayer), two new maps based on a new environment (multiplayer), a new set of co-op challenges and some refinements for the existing content.",

Nobunaga has only one goal: to unify the lands and rid his world of misery and suffering.\n\nFollowing the predecessors, this game comes with lots of cinematics and stays true to strategic as well as action gameplay, adding a few new things along the road, like collecting items during battles.\n\nThe two main aspects of this game are planning and engaging in battle. Select officers and strategically place them on the field of battle, assign commands and issue orders. When on the battlefield, each of the officers, including Nobunaga, will have his/her army at their disposal which can be controlled at any point. Level-ups bring additional special attacks to both officers and their troops.",

Instead his daughter, Rozalin is summoned, and Adell commits to returning her home to her father, as well as to defeating her father when they find him. \n\nThe game is a turn-based strategy RPG in the vein of Final Fantasy Tactics. Classes gain abilities by gaining character levels, and can level up those abilities through use. New items and equipment can be bought or won in battle, and can be powered up up by entering and winning battles inside a given item. Characters can also \"gang up\" on enemies by performing combos that are activated by positioning other characters near an attacking character. This action only uses the attacking character's turn, leaving the others free to attack again. Clever coordination can have characters attacking quite a few times per turn. New characters can be created (or even reborn as other classes or just more powerful versions of the same class) by petitioning (or even bribing with special items) the Dark Assembly with \"Mana\" you earn by defeating enemies.

      "description": "<i>The Eye of Judgment</i> is a turn-based card battle game using the PlayStation Eye camera peripheral and a 3x3 rectangular table mat with real trading cards. The camera not only recognizes the cards (using CyberCode matrix codes), but also the position and the rotation. The mat represents a battlefield where players can summon creatures and cast spells.\n\nThe story takes place in a fictional world, shaped by The Source. Mankind's vain leads to the construction of the Bioliths, devices of iron to help defeat the gods. After a long war, Jeano, the son on the Source, turns all the devices to rust. Eventually, after a time of re-establishment, four sages found four different nations: fire, water, earth and wood. There is a time of peace, until a mechanical fortress appears in the sky and the Biolith surprise attack wipes out 3 of the 4 nations. The remaining one, wood, receives a message to send a lone wizard to Cape Edgeworth with a single chance to defeat the Biolith Castle.\n\nThe game can played through singleplayer (adventure with a path and different kinds of opponents), head-to-head modes, or online. Through the camera, movement is tracked and the creatures seem to come to life on the screen. Each turn, players move a card, rotate it or change its position. The abilities change according to the position and placing a card face-up summons a creature. While attacking, the screen shifts to a battle mode where spells can be used. The center area is always Biolith, while the others are randomly divided over the 4 different elements, influencing the abilities and providing bonuses or weaknesses to certain creatures. Action are performed through mana, received at the beginning of a turn or through certain cards. The first player to capture 5 areas of the field, wins.\n\nNeat tricks with the camera include a profile mode where the player can hold a card in front of the camera to view the information and interact with the creature.\n\nThe base game comes with 30 summoning and 4 function cards, and a booster pack with 8 additional summoning cards (5 common, 2 uncommon, 1 rare or ultra rare). Additional packs can be bought separately.",

      "description": "The fourth installment in Koei's P.T.O. series brings strategic naval combat to the PS2.  There are two levels of play: global strategy and resource management are handled with a turn-based system on a world map while individual battles are fought using a real-time system on a much smaller scale.\n\nThe campaign can be played as the Americans, British, Japanese, or Germans, starting either in September 1939 or December 1941.  If a players chooses to be American or Japanese with a 1939 start date, they will sit on the sidelines and watch the war until December 1941, but they will still be able to gather resources and spend them to build units or develop technologies.  Players can also concoct \"what-if\" scenarios by changing which countries belong to which powers: for example, one could play an Alliance of America and Germany against an Axis of Japan and Great Britain, or even play three-on-one for more of a challenge.\n\nThe world map used in the turn-based grand strategy side of the game is broken down into territories connected in a web of lines indicating where fleets may pass from territory to territory.  Game turns on this scale represent one month, and the time it takes a fleet to move from one territory to another correlates loosely to the length of the line connecting them.\n\nPlayers collect resources from the territories they control every turn.  Resources include money, iron ore, aluminum, and oil.  Money is used for construction of new units and facilities and to speed scientific development, iron is used in construction of ships, aluminum is used in construction of aircraft, and oil is consumed when fleets move.\n\nTechnological advances are not purchased; instead players direct their scientists to focus on particular developmental paths, and breakthroughs come semi-randomly.  The longer the scientists have been working on a particular problem, the more likely a breakthrough becomes.  Giving the scientists extra money accelerates this process.  In addition to the ship and aircraft types that become available automatically with scientific advancements, players can design their own custom types using whatever technology is available to them at the time.\n\nPlayers decide which types of ships and aircraft to build and how many.  Ships are formed into fleets that can be moved about the world map while aircraft can be assigned to defend land-based airfields or assigned to fleets with ships capable of carrying aircraft.\n\nWhen two hostile fleets meet in the same territory, or when a hostile fleet enters a territory defended by land-based aircraft, a battle ensues.  Battles are controlled in real-time with a 3-D isometric view.  Players control entire fleets, not individual ships.  Orders include sending a fleet to a particular point, ordering a fleet to attack a particular other fleet or airfield, and launching and recovering aircraft for CAP or to attack a particular fleet or airfield.\n\nPlayers can assign the computer to control as much or as little of strategy as desired.  A player who enjoys the turn-based grand strategy but not the real-time battles can have the computer automatically resolve individual battles.  Conversely, a player who enjoys the real time battles but not resource management can assign various aspects of resource management to the computer so that the player only has to decide where to move fleets.  At the extreme, a player could even assign fleet movement to the computer and focus entirely on real-time combat.  The game also offers a scenario mode that skips grand strategy entirely and throws the player into an individual battle.",

      "description": "<i>Saiyuki: Journey West</i> is loosely based on one of the four classical novels of Chinese literature, <i>Journey to the West</i> (Chinese: <i>Xi You Ji</i>) by the 16th century writer Wu Cheng'en. This tactical RPG lets the players take the role of the novel's hero who is also a historical character, the 7th century scholar and Buddhist monk Xuanzang (Japanese pronunciation: <i>Sanzo</i>) and his monster companions, including the famous monkey Sun Wukong (Japanese pronunciation: <i>Son Goku</i>), as they travel to India. The game takes quite a few liberties with the original tale, including allowing the player to change Xuanzang's gender, giving each monster a more powerful \"were-\" form, and tying each character, save Xuanzang's, to an elemental affinity.\n\nThe real meat of the game is the tactical battles, where careful unit placement and use of each monster's unique special abilities determine the outcome of the battle.",

      "description": "<i>Bladestorm: The Hundred Years' War</i> has players take control of a mercenary for hire during the legendary English / French conflict. Lead soldiers, warriors and fellow swords for hire into battle on horseback or on foot, fighting alongside Joan of Arc or the King of England as you strive to become the mercenary champion and gain fame and fortune during these dark times.\n\nThe gameplay takes place in a 3rd-person perspective and takes the form of an action / RPG of sorts. The 'central hub' of the game is a local bar where the player attempts to find jobs that will increase his or her wealth and reputation, as well as dealers that will allow the player to change weaponry or buy more troops to fight alongside them. This hub area also serves as a meeting place for characters from the game world and the player may gleam information from gossip heard that will help them later in-game. Talking to the barman within will present a roster of missions available, the length of that particular campaign and the reward for success - these can take place on either the English or French side (you cannot ally with just one faction). Selecting one of these missions will take you to the battlefield.\n\nThe main game itself is broken down into what first appears to be a strategy sort of game in which the player is shown which territories they have to take to successfully complete the mission - however any strategic element ends here. They can then select which 'home camp' to start from. Once this is chosen they are presented with a battlefield (similar in respects to dynasty warriors). The main objective is to make their way to the castle / village to be taken and successfully seize it from the occupying troops. battling with any enemy troops they encounter along the way. \n\nThe player can command a number of differing types of combatants, from archers to footsoldiers to horseback, and later on in-game camel and elephant riders. Battles are a simple hack and slash affair, with the player attempting to clear the area of enemy troops. Once this has been achieved a base commander will appear at the base under siege. Beat this commander and the player will have seized the territory and completed the mission. Extra fame can be achieved from beating in combat the VIP enemies found throughout the mission. This in turn will also yield treasure for the player, some of which is collectible throughout the game.\n\nAs such, <i>Bladestorm</i> has no end - the player will continue to fight battles as they progress (This is after all the Hundred Years' War!), but there is a story arc within the game to be completed, and the amount of missions - although very similar can give players a lot game content to keep them happy.",

      "description": "<i>PixelJunk Monsters</i> is a tower defense strategy game with a tiki island theme. Players control the character Tikiman and move him around a single screen area to transform trees into defensive towers that attack automatically and to collect coins and gems. Coins are used to buy new towers, and gems are used to upgrade the towers for four different categories: damage, range, blast radius, and fire rate. Various monsters appear and move towards his flock at a central building. To complete level a set number of waves need to be held back. Contrary to similar games, actions can only be undertaken when Tikiman is at that location, so he needs to be moved around by the player. He cannot attack himself, but when he runs into an enemy some collected coins are spread around as he respawns.\n\nJust as gems may be used to purchase upgrades to towers, they may also, on occasion be used to purchase entirely new styles of towers for use. The Tikiman needs only take a moment to visit his home to get the new towers. Some towers attack only ground forces, some attack only air, and some work equally on both. Towers are again broken into two forms, physical or magical. Besides purchasing tower upgrades, towers may also be upgraded through combat experience. Tower effectiveness and experience is improved during moments when the Tikiman stands in front of a tower and dances, and the dancing is automatic when positioned on a tower. There are nine types of towers with a tenth one unlocked after beating a certain stage. At the start of the game usually only a small amount is available and additional ones are acquired by saving up gems and then unlocking them at the central building. Tikiman also earns upgrades by completing levels, such as the ability to run or plant mines.\n\nThe game features 21 different stages set on Tiki Island for single and offline multiplayer co-op modes for up to two players. Players are rewarded with a rainbow for completing levels without losing a single unit from the flock and a certain amount is needed to eventually access all levels.",

The player needs to battle his way through numerous battlefields, capturing forts and succeeding in objectives in order to bring about victory for his faction. It is an action game with traces of strategy when the player is faced with how to achieve certain sub-missions during a battle.\n\nIt is the first of the series to be designed specifically for Xbox 360/Playstation 3 generation of consoles and graphically makes better use of their hardware, allowing for sharper detail and more enemies on screen. New elements include a redesigned combo system, called \"Renbu\" where longer, though less varied, attack strings can be made and the ability to climb and swim.\n\nContrary to tradition of past games in the series, <i>Dynasty Warriors 6</i> offers <i>fewer</i> characters than before. Forty one characters are eventually unlocked, but only seventeen have story modes, each designed specifically for that character. The others can be used in the game's free mode and can be built up and obtain weapons and skills.\n\nThe Playstation Portable and Playstation 2 release adds 6 new character story modes and 5 new stages not found in the Xbox 360/Playstation 3.  The PSP version also adds Meng Huo from Dynasty Warrior 6: Empires as a playable character.",

      "description": "In <i>Jane's Hotel</i> the player controls the protagonist as she operates a bed and breakfast, oddly enough though no one stays in the hotel past 12:00 AM. In the old country Jane's grandparents had run a successful hotel but events in Europe unwillingly delivered them to American shores. After an abnormally large loan for such an endeavor from the local bank; Jane reenters the family business. \n\nThe gameplay, reminiscent of Diner Dash focuses on providing a comfortable stay for your guests each of whom will stay for about a minute, 3-5 hours in game time. When a guest wants something you can click on that thing and bring it to them; for example, the gentleman in room four wants coffee, go to the coffee machine and deliver it to his room. You may stack a series of actions to cover the wants of many customers. In addition to Jane you will also command a maid who is in charge of cleaning and other low duties.\n\nAs the game progresses more tasks will become available for you to perform as your guests start lounging about the lobby such as turning on televisions, delivering fruit, water plants, and so on. Your hotel will also gain more rooms, until you can't see them all on screen at a single time. Your ability to keep up with the increased demands will affect how big your tips are. General things can also affect tip size, dead plants have a negative effect, while an aquarium will be positive.\n\nEach level can be completed by gaining a certain amount of money  before the last guest leaves, at around midnight. Should you succeed you'll move a step closer to upgrading your hotel and be able to buy new amenities. \n\n<i>Jane's Hotel</i> is available in English and Russian.",

Puzzle.\n\nIt is a puzzle-solving game where you need to race to the top of a tower. The player is cast as an astronaut who needs to move from one side of a building to another before ascending a floor and repeating. The astronaut can move and jump but only to the square of a single color so the player will need to find unique pattern for each level. But to achieve a perfect floor clear, he needs also move over all squares of the same color on the floor. Moving deeper into the game, puzzles become more complex with challenges including one where he will need to change color in middle of the floor. The game also features a puzzle mode where like in tutorial different floors layout can be tried to find the right solutions.\n\nThe game features four-player multiplayer via PlayStation Network with different multiplayer modes - combination of the high-paced race to the top of each building, combined with the weapons you can dispatch against your enemy, challenges and leader boards.",

      "description": "<i>TV Show King</i> portrays a standard TV trivia game show, with over 3,000 questions split into difficulty categories of Normal, King, and Genius.  Game play is for 1-4 players, and can be played in lengths of 3, 6, or 9 rounds, each consisting of 7 questions.  Between each round players have the chance to spin a wheel where they may gain or lose money, or get the chance to steal or give money to another player.  At the end the top two players face off in a first-to-five-correct competition.\n\nThe actual questioning works by displaying a question on screen with the four possible answers below it; 15 seconds are given to pick the correct answer.  A player chooses the answer with the Wii Remote, so everyone can see what they've picked.  However, speed is rewarded: the second person with the right response will get less than the first person, and so on.  It's possible to switch your answer at any time, so it's quite possible to follow the crowd (or fake them out).  In later rounds a gimmick can be introduced to make the player use the Remote to see the answers, either by \"scratching away\" a covering in front of them or using the pointer like a flashlight where only the illuminated circle can be read.\n\nPlayers choose Miis to represent themselves; if fewer than four are playing, the remaining spots will be taken by random Miis from your system being pulled out of the crowd.  If one is playing alone and doesn't wish to go through the normal game, there's a solo Quiz Attack mode, where you continue play until giving an incorrect answer.",

      "description": "<i>Revolution</i> is a turn-based strategy game about development and territorial expansion, with sixteen distinct civilizations from prehistoric times to the future. Not counting Silent Service, it is the second console-only Sid Meier branded game, the first being Sid Meier's C.P.U. Bach, and it is the first in the Civilization sub series to be released on console platforms.\n\nSpecifically built up with console controls in mind, the original gameplay is intact but with stripped-down complexity. The available civilizations include America, England, Japan, Aztec, China, India, Mongolia, Rome, Egypt, France, Arabia, Greece, Spain, Germany, Zulu and Russia, each with their own leaders (e.g. Julius Caesar, Abraham Lincoln) and specific perks. Another civilization, the Barbarians, is not playable and they constantly wage war with the other ones. Gameplay sessions are generally shorter with fewer victory conditions and simplified city management. The possible strategies are still very open, as the four victory conditions are Domination, Technology, Economic and Cultural. Players can either build vast armies and try to dominate the other civilizations to capture their cities (Domination), or use a more subtle, diplomatic approach to gain the upper hand. There is a technology tree to eventually move into space and be the first to reach Alpha Centauri (Technology), players can try to create a World Back earn 20,000 gold (Economic), or build twenty wonders (Cultural).\n\nUnits are often specific for a certain civilization and gain experience, as well as through research, to access upgrades. That way, a catapult can eventually become a tank. The focus is as usual on micromanagement. The two single-player modes allow for straight matches against AI players or rather fixed scenarios to complete. Multiplayer is supported for up to four players, free-for-all or with teams.",

The rollercoasters are designed in a four window 3D view, in the style of many 3D model editors.\n\nThere are several other attractions to build, but the focus is on the rollercoasters, which you can ride in 3D. The game includes 3 modes of play: \"Challenge mode\", in which you have to construct a rollercoaster which accomplishes a set goal (like a thrill value above 100, safety above 50, maximum and minimum heights and so on), while avoiding to construct a device which will kill off all your visitors (as the ride goes on you get statistics on how people feel and if anyone has fallen off), \"Management mode\", which allows you to construct and run an entire amusement park, research new attractions and make sure you keep the money flowing, and a \"Quick Ride mode\", where you ride pre-built roller coasters.",

In the \"Animal Kingdom\", the King Lion has disappeared after being implicated in a series of scandals and as a result, animals across the kingdom demand a new king by holding an election.  The election becomes a stalemate, leading the lowliest form of animals, Clams, with the deciding vote.  As a result, each candidate must compete in a free-for-all to get the Clam vote and become the new president.\n\nThe gameplay mostly consists of competing on themed party boards, such as ships, a volcano and a snowy tundra, collecting clams to score points and raise their overall vote count while avoiding obstacles and attacks from rival opponents.  The results of each contest are showed in a news-themed stats screen, showing overall stats presented by animal newscasters such as a turtle and a woodpecker named Woodchuck Chumley.  Players can also form alliances after certain stages and recruit rival candidates to help them in later stages, only later to turn against them as well.\n\nThere are ten animals to choose (a hippo, armadillo, polar bear, octopus, platypus, and the game's namesake chimp) in the multiplayer mode, which has four human opponents competing against each other, but in the single-player <b>\"Campaign\"</b> mode, the player competes in ten stages, each themed for a certain animal during the game, competing in a series events aimed towards that character that they are controlling. There are also four opponents during the <b>\"Campaign\"</b> mode, but instead has three CPU opponents in place of human opponents.",

Once again the player will hire and release players, along with assistant coaches and various office personnel as well as edit plays to be used by their team.\n\nGames are once again played out in real time, but the player has no control of their team, instead they coach their players, telling them what runs to play as well as make game breaking decisions such as going for the win on 4th and goal with only a few seconds on the clock or faking a field goal and going for two points to win rather than tie the game.  Players can also control their team in the offseason, tracking future players in the <i>NFL Draft</i>.\n\nPlayers can also go online and share their playbook for others to view as well as compete head-to-head, coaching their team against their opponents.",

You earn money by completing missions and making sure you don't loose to many ships, the money can then be used to purchase hulls, weapons and subsystems to build new ships.",

At that time, the Imperial Alliance invades the Atlantic Federation of the west. Their war will soon encompass all of Europa, including the peaceful nation of Gallia. While small in size, Gallia is known for their rich deposits of ragnite ore, a powerful source of fuel and medicine.  When the Galian town of  Bruhl is invaded by Imperial Forces, Welkin Gunther, his sister Isara, and friend Alicia Melchiott, take up the fight against their foreign conquerors, joining the Gallian Militia, in this WWII-style game.\n\nThe player commands his forces through an overhead map, selecting units, and controlling them in a real-time 3rd person view. Taking on the enemy is done with a variety of units classes, including the Shocktrooper (basic soldier), Scout (excellent movement & sight), Lancer (anti-tank), Engineer (repair, resupply, mine defusal, and more), and the deadly Sniper.\n\nThis PS3-exclusive title features an art style best described as anime in watercolor.",

      "description": "<i>Nobunaga's Ambition: Iron Triangle</i> is another entry in KOEI's long-running series of grand strategy games. As in the previous instalments, the player assumes the role of a Japanese feudal lord during the famous Sengoku period (from the XV to the XVII century).\n\nThe main game screen shows an overhead 3D rendered view of the landscape, showing buildings and moving armies belonging to each clan. The player gives orders using a menu with a list of commands, that branch out with several options: City (to construct buildings), Personnel (to employ officers), Military (to move and attack with the army), Strategy, Diplomacy (to negotiate treaties and exchange technology) and others to review the resources. The game is paused while issuing the orders, and they are only executed when in Active mode, where time passes and seasons change.\n\nThe different seasons have an impact on certain resources and activities, like harvesting and drafting. The scheduled actions and rank position of the clans can be reviewed at any time, on a separate screen. The game has several scenarios and special modes, with historical notes coming up when the game time synchronizes with some major events in Japan's timeline.",

      "description": "In 2016 the unthinkable happens: An atomic war in Saudi Arabia not only kills over six million people but also disrupts the flow of the oil to the rest of the world. As a consequence, one year later America and Europe build a global missile defense network in space while Russia becomes the most important energy supplier and comes know the true promise of an economic boom making them once again a super power. Europe also unites itself under the flag of the European Federation - but without the United Kingdom.\n\nNow we write the year 2020 and the United States is almost finished building their Freedom Star, a orbital heavy weapons platform which once again will shift the balance of power on the planet and greatly increases the tension between the three super powers. It's only a matter of time until this tension unleashes itself in the last war mankind will ever fight: the EndWar.\n\n<i>Tom Clancy's EndWar</i> is a real-time strategy game without base construction and single unit control. Instead the player orders squads of gunships, tanks and such around while being able to order reinforcements after a certain amount of time has passed. It is however wise for the player to look after his squads as they gain experience during the course of the battle and advance in six ranks after a successful battle making them more and more powerful. It is even possible to upgrade the units in the four categories \"Attack\", \"Defense\", \"Mobility\" and \"Proficiency\" with credits earned at the end of each mission.\n\nWhat makes <i>Tom Clancy's EndWar</i> unique is the way how it is controlled. Instead of using a cursor, all actions are performed by voice command.\n\nEach squad and hostile as well as important points on the map have numbers and letters assigned to them and the player uses these in combination of a few keywords to issue an order. If the player e.g. wants to send his first squad of gunships to attack the second squad of enemy infantry he has to press and hold a button to activate voice recognition, say \"Unit 1 Attack Hostile 2\" (in the English version) and release the button. If the system understood the order it is then carried out. It is also possible to issue a series of orders by completing the first order without releasing the button. The system will then await the following orders to be spoken before activating them all upon the release of the button.\n\nTo make it easier for the player to know what he can say, an onscreen pop-up window opens up as the player progresses through the command chain showing all possible words that can  be used in the current context.\n\nDuring all this the camera always follows a squad. Freely moving around the battlefield is not possible. Instead the player jumps around with the command \"Unit Number Camera\" or activates the overview map called \"Sitrep\" which shows a abstract real-time map of the battlefield.\n\nThe single player campaign puts the player in control of all three armies while fighting battles all over the world against an unknown terrorist group. The game also features 1on1 and 2on2 skirmishes with bots, cooperative campaign play and a permanent online World War III-scenario in which thousands of players fight for world domination by joining one of the three factions and help conquering and defending points on the world map. These include air force bases which give access to air strikes and additional infantry units and capital cities that have to be conquered in three stages. Once a day a campaign-update rolls out which updates the map to reflect the territorial changes based on the battles fought in the last 24 hours.\n\nAs opposed to the the console-versions, the windows release also allows for control with mouse and keyboard, features an updated UI and camera and includes several new missions and multiplayer maps.

      "description": "The best scientists of the world thought they had found the ultimate solution to Global Warming: Building an artificial force field around the planet to help the rapidly decreasing atmosphere and guarantee the survival of mankind. It took more than 22 years to build but in the end it was acclaimed all around the world as the one symbol for hope and the ultimate proof that mankind can do anything. Well at least until they found the flaw in their perfect plan: Nature's ability to adapt.\n\nOnly known as the Happening, storms began to appear all over the planet. Stronger than anything mankind had ever seen they brought destruction and death upon the world. Whole cities where destroyed in just a few days and no end in sight. With no way to escape, the building of gigantic underground cryogenic sleep caverns began. Of course these caverns could only hold a privileged few and the rest was damned to stay on the surface, some starving to death, others going mad or killing each other.\n\nBut not everyone died. Many adapted, using everything that was left from the storm and over the centuries transformed into the Sai, humans that are one with nature. Meanwhile, deep down under the surface, the Echelon awaken from their sleep with the goal to reclaim their old planet.\n\n<i>Stormrise</i> is a real-time strategy game without base building and a unique point of view. Similar to Tom Clancy's EndWar the camera always follows a squad. But instead of using voice commands to switch between everyone, a technology called \"Whip Select\" comes into play. Holding a specific button down brings up a beam. Moving the beam over the symbol of one of the squads and letting go then changes the camera position to that squad and then allowing the player to order that unit around with the help of the 3D-target cursor.\n\nInstead of building a base and producing units there, the player starts with a pre-defined group of units in single player lead by Echelon-Commander Geary and a warp gate in multiplayer. Both modes also feature control points that automatically collect energy once captured. This energy is needed to call in reinforcements, upgrade units or outfit the control point with turrets, shields and such in three stages. It is even possible to create a second warp gate at the control point allowing the player to call reinforcements in closer to the front line.\n\nEither at the start or after upgrading them, most of the nine available units on each side get access to alternate weapons like flame throwers and additional offensive and defensive tactics. The player can change the current load-out of a unit at any time with the help of a circular menu that shows up after a button press.",

      "description": "On New Year's Eve 1958 Hyman Roth not only celebrated his birthday, he also celebrated the successful expansion of the Corleone family, successfully lead by Don Michael Corleone for fifteen years now, into Cuba. But the celebrations did not last long when suddenly \"la revolucion\" started and all hell breaks loose. Michael and Hyman manage to escape with most of the other family members but Aldo Trapani (the main protagonist in The Godfather) gets killed - just in time for five new families to threaten the Corleone family's control over New York, Florida and Las Vegas. As one of Aldo Trapani's closest soldiers, the player jumps into the role of Dominic to help Michael and the Corleone family win the war as well as to build a family of his now.\n\nLooking over Dominic's shoulder, the player moves freely through three cities depicting a New York, Florida and Cuba from the late '50s/early '60s traveling between them by airplane. Connected by the main storyline, the main goal of Dominic is to grow his family and destroy the other five families. This is done in two main steps: Taking over businesses and killing so-called \"Made Man\". Taking over a business is done the same way as in the predecessor: Enter the shop/joint/factory/construction site, fight through the enemy guards and find the person with the Godfather-sign over his head. That is the one the player needs to threaten until he gives up his resistance and pays his dues to Dominic from now on instead of the other family.\n\nEach business owner has his own weak spot as well as a breaking point. A weak spot ranges from destroying inventory to punching him or her in the face, and gives a 25% bonus on the monetary outcome. But if the player pressures the owner to much, he either dies from the torture or reaches his breaking point. Then he gets aggressive, cannot be intimidated anymore and attacks without mercy. Is the intimidation successful however, the player gets a one-time cash advance and gains money from the joint every day. In addition there are several rackets combined in a crime ring. Once the player controls it, he immediately gains a bonus until he loses one of the rackets in the crime ring. This goes for his enemy as well. When the player takes over a business of a crime ring, the bonuses like bullet-proof vests for all family members or brass knuckles for higher melee damage are instantly removed. That's why the enemy families do not just sit by and let Dominic take their businesses one by one. So the player has to hire guards to protect the businesses. In case of an attack, he can also send one of his soldiers to help in the defense.\n\nThis soldier or so-called \"Made Man\", is initially discovered and invited by the player to join his family while hanging out at the various safe houses and rackets. Each of them has a specialization. While one might be good at planting bombs, the other is a safe cracker very useful to rob banks and loot all the various safes in the city to get an achievement. As the player progresses through the game, he cannot only hire more family members, but can also promote a few of his soldiers. This allows them to learn a second and even third profession on top of their initial one. It is also possible to upgrade certain skills like Survival (stay longer conscious once out of health) of a family member, in return for hard-earned cash. When a made man is downed by enemy fire, he does not immediately get transferred to the next hospital or police station. Instead there is a time window in which everyone can revive the other with a shot of adrenaline. If it's too late, the player respawns at the hospital/police station and loses some money while his made man is out of the picture for a certain amount of time. This is also true for the player if he has a medic on his team, otherwise he goes directly to jail or the hospital.\n\nThe amount of time it takes them to get back on your side can be reduced by using favors. Favors are handed out by random people with a sign over their head on the streets and by high-ranking officials. Both give the player a mission which can involve killing or beating someone up, blowing a business (even one of the player's) to hell or something similar. The difference is, that the favor of an official can be saved for later like immediately rebuilding a bombed business. Favors of random people instead come in the form of money rewards or kill conditions.\n\nKill conditions are needed to get an enemy made man. Just shooting them only puts them in the hospital. To take them permanently out the picture, the player needs to make an example of the man by fulfilling the kill condition. Shoving a made man from the roof of a building, putting a bullet between his eyes and such are examples for such kill conditions. Once all made men of a family have been eliminated forever, the player can deal the final blow to the rival family: killing their Don and blowing up their compound. All while dealing with the police that hunts you down just for forgetting to silence a witness of a crime.\n\nThe game also features a multiplayer mode that ties in with the single player campaign. Upon entering the multiplayer mode, the player chooses one of his family members he has hired in single-player and takes on his role. During his participation in the four game modes Team Deathmatch, Demolition Assault (blow up three objects in enemy territory), FireStarter (torch barrels, gas and propane tanks to rack up scoring multiplicators), Safecracker (bust a safe and hold the position for more points), the player then earns honor points for his family member. These are used in single player to buy a new weapon license for that soldier, which allows him to use the higher level weapons the player finds scattered around the city and can be handed to him.",

This is challenging due to the hazardous environments the animals exist in -- the players will have to defend their flock against hungry predators, avoid pits of death, and send their animals flying with catapults. In the single player campaign, the player will solve at fifty single player levels across several seasons (summer, autumn, winter).\n\nA cooperative mode is also present, offering players to work as a team. For instance, one player could lift a fence and the other player could guide a flock of animals under it.  The game will also grant access to the same map editor the developers used to make the official levels, so players can make their own puzzles. Players will be able to share maps with others via a persistent map server.",

      "description": "<i>Plants vs. Zombies</i> belongs to the \"tower defense\" sub-genre of casual games, where the objective is to deploy a series of stationary weapons to protect a structure against hordes of enemies. Plants provide the artillery, and can be bought with sun power, the game's currency. The enemies are zombies invading a suburban lawn. At the start of each level, the player starts to plant the available seeds on the lawn in a strategic manner. Zombies slowly begin to appear from the street at the right side, just a few initially, and must be destroyed before they can reach the house on the other side. Sun power icons falls from the sky randomly, and must be collected with the mouse to increase the funds. The sunflower can be planted to generate extra units of sun power, but doesn't have any attack power against the invading undead. Besides their cost, the seed packs take some time to recharge after being used.\n\nThere are several types of offensive plants available. Pea shooters are the basic variety, spitting a projectile forwards every few seconds. Variations appear later in the game, shooting several peas at the same time and freezing the enemies, making them move slower. The carnivorous plant gobbles up a zombie when he gets near its gaping mouth, but takes some time to do so, becoming ineffective while busy digesting the corpse. The cherry bomb explodes after being deployed, carbonizing any of the undead surrounding its landing spot. The potato mine is half-buried with a sensor sticking from the top, and detonates when one of the walking dead steps on it. Plants can be removed with the shovel to make space for new ones.\n\nMini-games appear from time to time. There are twenty of them, and most are parodies of well-known casual titles: ZomBotany (1 and 2), Wall-nut Bowling (1 and 2), Slot Machine, It's Raining Seeds, Beghouled, Invisi-ghoul, Seeing Stars, Zombiquarium, Beghouled Twist, Big Trouble Little Zombie, Portal Combat, Column Like You See 'Em, Bobsled Bonanza, Zombie Nimble Zombie Quick, Whack a Zombie, Last Stand, Pogo Party, and Dr. Zomboss's Revenge. After being played once, they become available directly from the main menu.\n\nThe game has three gameplay modes. In the main adventure mode, levels get progressively more difficult, and at the end of each one the player receives a new plant for the arsenal. Puzzle mode has two variations: \"Vasebreaker\", where the goal is to break the vases scattered on the lawn, to uncover plants or zombies and use the former to fight the latter, and \"I, Zombie\", where the player controls the zombies against the plants. In survival mode, the zombies attack in turns. After each turn, the player can choose plants from the arsenal. There are three types of survival: normal (one wave per turn, 5 turns) on each of the five maps, hard (two waves per turn, 5 turns) on each of the five maps, and endless (two waves per turn, endless amount of turns) on the pool map.\n\nThe Zen Garden stores all the available plants, where they have to be tended, watered, fertilized, sprayed for bugs and listen to music. When they are happy, they drop coins that can be used to buy more plants and other garden additions.",

      "description": "Koei brings us again a new addition to the Dynasty Warriors series. This installment still features the same storyline based on the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, with the various officers as playable characters. The character list and appearance is the same as in Dynasty Warriors 6, meaning some of the previous game's characters are not available.\n\nThe difference in this one is that the player is allowed to choose only one character for the chosen force (either Wei, Wu or Shu) who starts in a village that will act as the hub, or camp, from which the game battles are accessed. By completing story missions, some characters are added and can be played as without starting a new game, meaning all acquired weapons, items and materials will be kept.\n\nThe chosen character can be customized in various ways. Apart from the main weapon, one sub weapon, chosen from many weapon types, can be equipped. Both weapons can be switched anytime during battle, to accommodate the situation. A new addition is the Chi system which allows to set special abilities to the character, there are four slots to equip Chi (the two arms and legs). Weapons can also be customized by adding Orbs that give different abilities, such as elemental properties.\n\nIn the village, the player can exchange materials, buy weaponry, items for use in battle, Chi skills and Orbs. Some NPC's may appear in the village, some giving materials or items, or Officer cards, which can be set to help the Village's growth. Over time, better items can be acquired from the shops.\n\nBy talking to the quest board or the Guard at the village's gate, main Missions or Requests can be chosen. Each battle is a series of small maps where various enemy soldiers and weaponry are fought, eventually leading to the commander of the enemy army. The goal of each battle can vary, some are classic goals like \"Defeat the Commander\" and some, less battle oriented, like \"Retrieve all treasure boxes\". In addition, there also are bonus missions that require the player to defeat a particular unit, reaching a certain point before a certain time, etc. Each bonus mission gives extra experience points upon completion.\n\nOther new additions to the battle system are the possibility to have aerial battles, and the main feature of the game: the Fury Mode, unleashed when the Fury gauge (replacing the traditional Musou gauge) is full. The furied character has better stats and move sets, and can unleash the infamous Musou attack to deal some extra damage.\n\nTo add to the surreal look of the game, some new bosses are actually massive beast-like weapons, and usually require the help of other players to defeat them. Multiplayer mode is available only via AdHoc connection, and can connect up to four players.\n",

As in the original card game, the player casts magic spells to summon various creatures, add enchantments to them, and cause various other effects, and attacks the other players to destroy them. The game is meant to be easy for new <i>M:tG</i> players to pick up, while not disappointing experienced players. Some of the game mechanics, such as tapping lands, is done automatically, and there's no deck construction - only unlocking cards and pre-built decks.\n\nThe game has two campaigns, for single-player and two-player co-operative play. In online play, in addition to classic two-player duels, the game supports two-player co-operative play and free-for-all play, up to 4 players. Online play also has ranked play modes and a leaderboard. The game also has various puzzle challenges to solve.",

Players can change to any class by picking up their corresponding hat. The maps contain several structures that should be built by the workers to give ones own team an advantage - these require harvesting resources first though. An additional important feature is feeding the princess cake to make her heavier. This makes it more difficult for the other team to carry her away.\n\nThe game contains other modes besides the rescue-the-princess-mode: there's a single player story mode, team deathmatch and a checkpoint-control-mode. An additional feature is the arena, where the player can fight using each class gladiator-style to survive as many levels as possible.",

There Eddie must fight his way through the hordes of the demon Emperor Doviculus to free humanity.\n\n<i>Br\u00fctal Legend</i> is set in a free-roaming world inspired by heavy metal album covers, with the primary mode of transportation around the world being Eddie's car \"The Deuce\" (AKA \"The Druid Plow\"). Combat is mostly basic hack-and-slash, alternatively attacking with either Eddie's axe or his guitar Clementine. Through Eddie's guitar the power of rock can summon his car, melt enemy's faces, and even raise ancient structures left behind by the Titans. Many of the main missions, and the multiplayer mode, add real-time strategy elements to the mix. During these missions there are fan-geysers on the battlefield that can be harvested by summoning merchandise booths. Fans are spent to create units that can be commanded and even double-teamed with for devastating results. The ultimate goal of most of these missions is to destroy the enemy's stage before they destroy yours.\n\nUpgrades can be purchased for Eddie's combat abilities and his car from The Guardian of Metal at the center of the Earth. The upgrades come in exchange for Fire Tributes that are collected by completing main and side missions, and finding the various collectibles around the landscape.",

Similar to the other <i>Empires</i> games, it adds turn-based empire-building gameplay to the mix.  Although battles are still fought using the same 3rd-person button mashing mechanics that the <i>Samurai Warriors</i>-style games are known for, players now must also choose the battles to maximize the growth of their burgeoning empire in Japan's Warring States era. In the Empire mode there are several historical battles available.\n\nThe game also adds two previously unplayable characters, Shibata Katsuie and Sasaki Kojir\u014d, as well as a Create Your Own Character mode.",

Win or lose at the Row, you'll still play a pricing game after, and try to rack up the most money before you get your three strikes.\n\nThe Wii version offers a \"Party Mode\" where up to four players start initially, and any available human (or computer) players swap in as a player leaves Contestant's Row. Multiplayer is not available on the DS, and is planned to be added as an Internet-based \"Price is Right Live\" for the PC.\n\nWinning pricing games in single player unlocks that game to be available to play at any time from the main menu. You also unlock new clothing and hairstyles for your avatar. The Wii and PC versions further unlock video clips of humorous moments from the show.",

      "description": "Don't let the \"2010 Edition\" fool you - this is based off of the original version of the popular 80's game show <i>Press Your Luck</i>. The garish 1980s set and the flow of the show have both been faithfully replicated in digital form. The game features a single player mode, where the contestant plays through 20 shows of different opponents and increasing difficulty. Alternatively, up to three players can play an episode as contestants in the game's \"Party Mode.\"\n\nGameplay mirrors the game show it is based on. There are two rounds, each with a question phase and a board phase. Players are asked four multiple-choice questions in the question phase. Ringing in first and giving the correct answer nets you 3 spins. The other two players then get a chance to pick their answer to earn 1 spin. Incorrect answers gain no spins.\n\nIn the board phase, players use their accumulated spins to rack up cash. The board \"spins\" at random until the player hits a button to stop the cycle, earning whatever cash on the space the board stopped on. If the board stops on a cartoon \"Whammy,\" that contestant's score is set to zero. Four Whammies removes that contestant from the game. The idea is to \"press your luck\" as long as you can, and then dump remaining spins off on another player in hopes of forcing them into a Whammy.\n\nAs players win games, they unlock new costumes and hairstyles for their avatar.",

      "description": "The 2010 Edition is a home game adaptation of the current iteration of the long-running competitive game show <i>Family Feud</i>. Two families face off against each other by predicting the most popular results of a survey question given to 100 people. Points are awarded based on the number of surveyed people who gave that same response (i.e. 63 people equal 63 points). Suggesting an answer that was not given by those surveyed gives that family a strike. The first family to reach 300 points wins the game and goes to a bonus round to try and increase their final score.\n\nThe 2010 edition offers two gameplay modes. A single-player mode pits your team against ten families of increasing intelligence across ten \"episodes\" of the show. Success awards new clothing and hairstyles for your in-game avatar. A multi-player mode pits two teams (the actual number of people on the teams limited only by who is in the room) against each other in a full episode of the show.",

      "description": "Although <i>James Cameron's Avatar: The Game</i> is named after the movie, the story itself doesn't follow the plot of the film. Instead the player takes on the role of Lance Corporal Ryder, a signal-specialist who is send to the distant moon Pandora. But Ryder isn't just any other soldier. Instead he or she is one of the selected group of people that take part in the so-called Avatar-program. Avatars are a hybrid of Na'vi DNA and human DNA that have been created in order to better interact with the inhabitants of the planet: the Na'vi, tribe-like and technology-wise not very advanced people that are one with nature. Although the Na'vi are friendly to the new-comers at first, soon the humans want more than just diplomatic relations. They want to relocate the Na'vi in order to be able to strip the planet of its natural resources. A war breaks out which only one side can win - it is up to the player which it will be.\n\nEarly in the game the player has to decide weather he wants to help the Na'vi unlock the power of the Well of Souls or if he wants to stay with the humans. Depending on his choice, the gameplay changes significantly:\n<ul><li><b>Human</b>: As a human the player can enter buildings, drive vehicles like buggies and helicopters and use full-body armor as well as several different kinds of firearms including shotguns and flamethrowers. In addition Pandora itself is against him meaning both plants and animals will attack the player but will also grant experience points. As a human the player can build pods that replenish ammo and health a specific locations.\n\n<li><b>Na'vi</b>: The Na'vi are more than two meters high and as such can neither enter buildings nor use humans vehicles. But Pandora herself is friendly so plants and animals won't attack (or give experience points for that matter) allowing the player to ride strange horses or fly around on huge dinosaur-like creatures. While the player himself is able to use a machine gun, normally the Na'vi rely on bows and arrows as well as strange swords and staves. If the player manages to pull of a five-hit-combo, a special attack comes available. Na'vi harvest plants in order to get arrows and cell samples.</li></ul>\nBoth characters have in common, that they are controlled in a standard 3rd-person-shooter-fashion and have to collect DNA/cell samples. Once enough have been collected, the player gains the ability to get right back into the fight after his hit-points reach zero. Only if not enough samples have been collected will the player re-spawn at the nearest outpost. Also both parties earn experience points for completing quests and killing enemies. Once enough points have been collected, the character levels up and get's access to new weapons and spells allowing him to make himself invisible for example.\n\nPandora is divided into several sectors and each sector features several challenges like lifting 100% of the fog of war or collecting a certain amount of cell samples. Fulfilling these objectives grants additional experience points. To further help the player in his quest, a world-domination-mini-game is available at each transporter. This mini-game is turn-based and has the player starting out with only one sector and the goal of conquering all the other. Doing so will grant his character additional experience points, increase his weapons strength and such. Money for building bases and ordering troops on the other hand is earned by playing through the normal campaign. To conquer enemy sectors, three types of units are available that can only be build at a base. Combat is a simple numbers game and plays out automatically. To defend conquered sectors, a defense building for each type of unit can be build.\n\nThe game offers five team-based multiplayer-modes: King of the Hill, Capture the Flag, Team Deathmatch, Capture and Hold (capture control points in order to make the enemies team loose victory points) and Final Fight where the RDA has to protect three missiles in their base while the Na'vi have to destroy them.",

      "description": "<i>Farm Frenzy</i> is a straightforward time-management game, where the player controls a farm, raising animals and selling products to the market. The main game screen is mostly occupied by a central bare patch of land where the farm animals roam, surrounded by a series of farm implements and machines. All necessary actions are performed with clicks over interactive hotspots of the scenery.\n\nThe objective is displayed at the start of the level, usually requiring a certain amount of resources, money or other goals. Initially, the player has to click on the well to collect water and on the ground to grow the grass that feeds most of the livestock. The animals can be purchased from a tab at the top, to eat the turf and generate products every few moments. Geese lay eggs, sheep shed cotton, cows produce milk, and all these resources have to be collected and stacked on boxes at the bottom storage shed. The boxes have to be shipped to the market by clicking on the truck, that takes a few moments to make the transportation of all the selected goods. A small animation at the bottom-right shows the vehicle going back and forth between the farm and the city.\n\nDangerous bears appear randomly on the farm, and kill any animal that cross their paths. They have to be quickly contained on cages, and afterwards collected on boxes to be sold as a product. If the cage remains untouched on the field for too long, the bear eventually breaks free and runs out of the farm. The storage space at the bottom is limited, and sometimes bears and other products can't be stored on time and disappear after a while.\n\nThe structures surrounding the game field are used to process the raw materials produced by the farm into more refined products, like powdered eggs, cheese, baked goods and other items. The stars received after completing a level have to be spent on upgrades to the machines on the shop screen, to make them more efficient and unlock new levels. There is no time limit to complete each stage, but finishing within a specific time frame, shown at the top, gives awards and bonus stars.",

Under Futuretech command, there are Soviet, Allied and Rising Sun units available to conquer each of the main and side challenges unlocking more units along the way.\n\nThe console version also uses a revamped control scheme allowing the player to handle everything under one menu: The player can select and cycle through units by simple button presses and has an efficient radial menu that replaces the regular one, which is used to construct buildings, issue unit commands and battle styles.",

      "description": "<i>Texas Cheat 'em</i> is a variant of the poker staple Texas Hold 'em, where, as the title suggests, players are allowed (and even encouraged) to cheat.\n\nThe underlying game follows all the rules of Hold 'em, and plays like a standard digital replication. Each round, players are awarded an amount of cheat points, which can then be spent on 15 tricks such as X-ray Vision (see another player's hidden cards), Card Suggestion (where you change one of your cards to another), or even something as blatant as stealing chips from another player.\n\nTo succeed at the cheat, the player must win a brief casino-themed mini-game, such as stopping a slot machine or roulette wheel at a specific target. For cheats where one player is directly affecting or attacking another (like stealing chips), the mini-game involves both players, such as rapidly tapping a button to make their horse cross the finish line first. If the player wins at the mini-game, the cheat is performed. If the player loses, the points are spent and nothing happens.\n\nPlayers can play alone against the A.I., or online with up to eight players at a table. The player can use their Xbox Avatar to represent them in-game, or select from a variety of character portraits.",

Players take turns controlling one worm at a time, and can either position the worm until time runs out, or use one weapon from a selectable menu.  Direct fire weapons (shotguns, Uzis) are used by the worm that selected it against whatever's nearby.  Thrown weapons (grenades, bazookas) are aimed by the player and affected by ever-changing wind.  Explosive weapons (airstrikes, bombs) blow holes in the terrain and drop any nearby worms into the new craters.\n\nMost weapons have a limited number of uses per map.  Each individual worm on the team has their own health meter, and will die when it reaches zero or they are knocked off the terrain and into the water.  The team that loses all its worms loses the match.\n\nPlayers can compete against the single-player A.I., or against each other online or off.  Multiplayer features different game types (deathmatch, forts, and races), with leaderboards for each.  Players also unlock customization options as they play through the single-player campaign, allowing them to create new teams with custom names, hats,  voices, and attitudes.",

      "description": "A new entry in the Vandal Hearts series, <i>Flames of Judgement</i> follows the story of young orphan Tobias Martin as he bands together with his schoolmates to help defend his homeland against a rival kingdom.  The story acts as a prequel to the original Vandal Hearts.\n\nThe series' trademark isometric combat returns, now presented in 3-D with 3-D character models.  Players attempt to position themselves tactically to gain an advantage over stronger (or more numerous) foes.  Combat takes place in turns, with each side moving one character per turn.  Each party member can carry two weapons and switch between them without using up a \"turn,\" allowing them to shift quickly from a sword to a long-range bow, for example. Characters gain levels through successful battles, and increase skills with a particular weapon or spell  by using that weapon or spell in combat.\n\nMany engagements expand beyond simple combat by introducing some sort of puzzle element, ranging from pushing boulders to protecting characters from attackers. Missions may also radically update their goals as progress is made.  In addition to the standard game, there are also multiple endings and multiple \"secret maps\" unlocked across the regular levels.",
