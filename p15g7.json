      "description": "The Confederation have been at war with the Kilrathi for the past 20 years, and you're just now joining the Vega campaign. You're a 2nd Lieutenant just out of the Academy, with some good work under your belt. You're posted to Tiger's Claw, the flagship of the Confederation Fleet.  Will you help the Confederation to victory, or go down in infamy? \n\n<i>Wing Commander</i> is a space combat simulator interspersed with shipboard dialogs. Onboard the ship, you can save/load game, visit the bar to get the latest gossip, or go on to the next mission briefing, and the 3D space combat part. \n\nThe 3D space combat has you sitting in the cockpit, where you control the craft like roll, turn, up/down, afterburner, as well as fire guns and launch missiles. There are four different crafts on the Confed side, each with different flight characteristics and armament. You will have a wingman on each mission, and you should keep the wingman alive as the wingman will help you if you issue the right orders. You can also taunt the enemy. You'll be fighting several different types of enemy fighters and capital ships, and even combat a few Kilrathi aces. \n\nWhen the mission is complete, land back onboard the ship and get ready for the next one. The campaign tree has both winning and losing paths. \n\n",

      "description": "It is said the the Cosmic Forge is a magical pen possessing an enormous power: whatever is written with it instantly becomes true. A group of explorers ventures into the castle that where the king, the queen, and the wizard who created the pen used to dwell. Nobody knows what has been happening there for the last hundred years, since nobody dares to enter the haunted castle. As the heroes step in, the doors behind them close forever. They are left alone to discover the truth about the Cosmic Forge and the drama that occurred between the castle's inhabitants.\n\n<i>Bane of the Cosmic Forge</i> is the sixth entry in the Wizardry series. While retaining the basic premise of creating a party of up to six adventurers to roam first-person dungeons and fight enemies in turn-based combat, this installment contains numerous enhancements and new features. It is the first game in the series to feature full color graphics and a mouse-driven interface. Combat options are more detailed, with precise weapon moves (such as thrust and bash) available. Magic is divided into six different schools, the spellcaster's powers increasing if he or she concentrates on one of them. Picking locks or disarming traps by thief-like classes is done actively by participating in a simple minigame. Characters can learn skills unique to their class when leveling up. These skills range from weapon proficiencies to field abilities that can be used outside of combat.\n\nIn addition to the traditional races of humans, elves, dwarves, hobbits, and gnomes, the player can choose between the Lizardman, the cat-like Felpurr, the canine Rawulf, the pixie-like Faerie, the intimidating Dracon, and the furry Mook. Each race has its own strengths and weaknesses, as well as predispositions to certain classes. Exotic character classes such as Valkyrie, Alchemist, Psionic, Ninja, Samurai, and Monk are also available during character creation, though they require a higher amount of bonus points received during the initial dice roll. It is also possible for characters to switch to another class during the course of the game.\n\nConversations with NPCs have been extended, the player being able to talk about various topics with the same character. The game also features a branching storyline: depending on the player's choice to believe or mistrust a key character, the plot will split into different directions, resulting in several different endings. The entire game takes place within the castle and its surroundings, without the possibility to travel back to the town or create other characters after the game has started. Unlike the previous entries, it is possible to save the game anywhere manually.",

      "description": "The Union Aerospace Corporation has been experimenting with teleportation technology on Mars' moons Phobos and Deimos. After early successes, something goes wrong. It seems the scientists have opened a gateway straight to Hell. Phobos base is overrun with demonic creatures, and the whole of Deimos simply vanishes. A squad of marines is sent to Phobos, but all except one are quickly slaughtered. It falls to the surviving marine to grab some guns and strike back at the demons.\n\nid Software's follow-up to their genre-defining Wolfenstein 3D, <i>DOOM</i> is another first-person 3D shooter: full-on action seen from the space marine's perspective. Like Wolfenstein, the game consists of distinct episodes, playable in any order. The first episode, <i>Knee-Deep in the Dead</i>, takes place in the Phobos base and is freely available as shareware. The full game continues on Deimos in <i>The Shores of Hell</i> and culminates in <i>Inferno</i>, the final episode which takes place in Hell itself (the Sega 32x version lacks this episode).\n\nThe basic objective in each level is simply to reach the exit. Since dozens of enemies stand in the way, the only way to get there is through killing them. Switches and buttons must be pressed to advance at certain points and often color-coded locked doors will block the way - matching keycards or skull keys must be found to pass.\n\nThe game's engine technology is more advanced than Wolfenstein's, and thus the levels are more varied and complex. The engine simulates different heights (stairs and lifts appear frequently) and different lighting conditions (some rooms are pitch black, others only barely illuminated). There are outdoor areas, pools of radioactive waste that hurt the player, ceilings that come down and crush him, and unlike Wolfenstein's orthogonally aligned corridors, the walls in <i>DOOM</i> can be in any angle to each other. An automap helps in navigating the levels.\n\nStylistically, the levels begin with a futuristic theme in the military base on Phobos and gradually change to a hellish environment, complete with satanic symbols (pentagrams, upside-down-crosses and portraits of horned demons), hung-up mutilated corpses and the distorted faces of the damned.\n\n<i>DOOM</i> features a large weapon arsenal, with most weapons having both advantages and drawbacks. The starting weapons are the fists and a simple pistol. Also available are a shotgun (high damage, slow reload, not good at distances), a chaingun (high firing rate, but slightly inaccurate in longer bursts) and a plasma rifle (combining a high firing rate and large damage). The rocket launcher also deals out lots of damage, but the explosion causes blast damage and must be used with care in confined areas or it might prove deadly to the player as well as the enemies. Two further weapons in the game are the chainsaw for close-quarter carnage, and the BFG9000 energy gun, that, while taking some practice to fire correctly, can destroy most enemies in a single burst. The different weapons use four different ammunition types (bullets, shells, rockets and energy cells), so collecting the right type for a certain gun is important.\n\nThe game drops some of Wolfenstein's arcade-inspired aspects, so there are no extra lives or treasures to be collected for points, but many other power-ups are still available. Medpacks heal damage while armor protects from receiving it in the first place. Backpacks allow more ammunition to be carried, a computer map reveals the whole layout of the level on the automap (including any secret areas), light amplification visors illuminate dark areas and radiation suits allow travel over waste without taking damage. Also available are berserk packs (which radically increase the damage inflicted by the fists) as well as short-time invisibility and invulnerability power-ups.\n\nThe enemies to be destroyed include former humans corrupted during the invasion, plus demons in all shapes and sizes: fireball-throwing imps, floating skulls, pink-skinned demons with powerful bite attacks and large one-eyed flying monstrosities called Cacodemons. Each episode ends with a boss battle against one or two especially powerful creatures.\n\n<i>DOOM</i> popularized multiplayer in the genre with two different modes: Cooperative allows players to move through the single-player game together, while Deathmatch is a competitive game type where players blast at each other to collect 'frag' points for a kill and re-spawn in a random location after being killed.\n\nThe 3DO and Sega32x ports lack any multiplayer modes, though the other ports retain the DOS versions multiplayer to varying degree. The various console ports all feature simplified levels and omit some levels, enemies and features from the original DOS release. The SNES and Gameboy Advance versions of the game actually use different engines and hence feature numerous small gameplay differences.",

      "description": "This is an arcade rail-shooter based on the film <i>Terminator 2: Judgment Day</i>. Up to two players shoot through future and present levels as robotic killers reprogrammed to serve the human resistance. \n\nBoth players wield a machine gun with infinite ammo that lowers its firing rate (overheats) as it is continuously fired. A secondary weapon (missile launchers in the future, shotguns in the present) has limited ammo but deals heavy damage. Powerups inside the game world include secondary weapon ammo and coolant for the machine guns, and are shot to be collected.\n\n<i>Terminator 2: Judgment Day</i>, renamed <i>T2: The Arcade Game</i> for home conversions, features seven levels based on specific scenes or general concepts in the film. The first four levels act as a prelude, as the player guns down waves of metal Terminators across a post-apocalyptic Battlefield, a besieged Human Hideout, and through the security checkpoints of the enemy supercomputer SkyNet. After destroying the computer, players travel back in time to protect John and Sarah Connor, while also destroying every scrap of SkyNet research at the headquarters of its manufacturer. From there, players must fend off the indestructible T-1000 until the final showdown in the Steel Mill.\n\nAssets from the movie are used when possible, such as voice clips from Arnold Schwarzenegger, and close-up digital stills of Robert Patrick for the final battle against the T-1000. The Genesis and SNES versions also support lightguns (the Menacer and Super Scope, respectively).",

      "description": "The space traveler and rogue guardian Sheltem has left the world VARN, where he was pursued by the relentless Corak the Mysterious and a party of local adventurers helping him. The Gates to Another World eventually takes all of them to another world, known as CRON. There, a great turmoil is caused by Sheltem's actions, and the heroes must stop his madness, preventing him from casting the planet into its own sun. \n\n<i>Gates to Another World</i> is the second installment in the Might and Magic series, and a sequel to Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Core gameplay is similar to predecessor, with the player creating a party of six characters and exploring vast first-person 3D environments, while fighting enemies in turn-based combat and leveling up. Unlike the first game, enemy encounters occur at set points rather than spawning randomly, though enemy type selection is still random.\n\nLike in the previous game, character classes rely each on a particular attribute to be effective. Knight, Paladin, Archer, Cleric, Sorcerer and Robber return, with the addition of two new classes, Ninja and Barbarian. Race selection features humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes, and half-orcs. There are several locations and items that are restricted to certain genders, alignments, or races. A new feature is the possibility to hire two non-player characters to travel with the party and participate in battles. A new skill system is introduced as well, allowing characters to learn such abilities as mountaineering (necessary to traverse mountains), linguist (for reading certain messages), cartographer (for creating an auto-map), and others.\n\nCompared to the first game, the sequel is more quest-oriented, with various characters in towns giving quests to the party, as opposed to purely exploration-based traveling in the predecessor. Time also plays a large role in this game, with some instances requiring the party to travel to different time periods. Characters also age as the game goes on; If the player waits too long, the characters' statistics will change to reflect their aging, and they will eventually die. ",

However, the great battle between the guardians Corak and Sheltem continued in another place - the world of Terra, where Sheltem was originally appointed as a guardian. Revolting against the powerful race of the Ancients, Sheltem takes possession of their space-traveling nacelles, hurling them at the suns of other planets. It is now up to a group of local adventurers to help Corak and vanquish Sheltem once and for all.\n\n<i>Isles of Terra</i> is the third installment in the Might and Magic series, and a sequel to Gates to Another World. Like its predecessors, it is a role-playing game focusing on first-person exploration of vast pseudo-3D environments, character building, and turn-based combat. The five selectable races remain the same as in the previous games, as well as the eight character classes with the addition of two new ones: Druid and Ranger. Like in the second game, characters may learn unique skills such as thievery, swimming, merchant, and others.\n\nThis installment does away with random or pre-set enemy encounters, featuring instead enemies dynamically roaming the game world, allowing to initiate combat from a distance (for example with ranged attacks or spells). There is no option to bribe or surrender to enemies, and escaping combat can be accomplished simply by moving away, unless the enemies have already locked on the party. An automap feature is available at all times, and the player is also allowed to save the game at any time.",

It utilizes a first-person view for exploration, similarly to Dungeon Master and Eye of the Beholder.  One of the more remarkable features is in the first-person mode: rather than having just 4 directs to face and flicking between them, there are 8 directions and the view scrolls smoothly as you turn. This smooth scrolling continues when you move forward, giving the game more of a 3D feel.\n\nThe action elements consist of horizontal scrolling areas where you fight enemies with your bow while avoiding their attacks.  Later you encounter a similar type of gameplay that involves exploring castles and adds 4 directional movement.",

      "description": "After L'Kbreth's Orb was used to bring peace back to the land of Llylgamyn, a new threat emerges in the region. Strange malevolent energies have been spotted beneath the Temple of Sages. These energies - called the \"Maelstrom\" by the local inhabitants - can be sealed by a person known as the Gatekeeper. Unfortunately, the latter has been imprisoned by a mysterious power or person only referred to as SORN. A party of brave adventurers seeks out the high priest G'bli Gedook, the guardian of L'Kbreth's Orb, who explains to them that they have to release the Gatekeeper and eventually vanquish the evil at its core.\n\n<i>Wizardry V: Heart of the Maelstrom</i> returns to the gameplay concept of the first three installments of the series, abandoning the unusual premise of its predecessor. As in the initial games, the gameplay consists of exploring a vast maze-like dungeon with a custom party created and outfitted in the game's only town. Though visually very similar to their predecessors, the game's dungeon is no longer limited to a square layout. Several tweaks have been applied to the gameplay system, including range rating for all weapons (allowing back row attacks), a more prominent role for the Thief class (who can now hide in shadows, backstab enemies, and open locks), etc.\n\nThe game is more puzzle-oriented than the preceding entries, requiring the player to obtain a larger quantity of crucial items needed for its completion. It is the first installment in the series with friendly NPCs who can be encountered in the dungeon and interacted with by typing keywords. Also for the first time, the game allows - but does not require - importing characters from a previous scenario.",

Race to Jabba the Hutt's palace in a speeder, fight your way through Jabba the Hutt's minions before killing Jabba himself, control speeder bikes and the Millennium Falcon, and much more.",

It's up to Mario, armed with his trusty Super Scope, to ride Yoshi to track down Bowser and put a stop to his evil plans.\n\nUnusual for the Mario games, <i>Yoshi's Safari</i> uses a first-person perspective. Gameplay consists of shooting enemies before they attack. Hidden areas and other secrets can be unlocked by shooting at large gates. There are bosses along the way that must be destroyed before players can move on to the next area. Game supports single or multi-player game modes.",

      "description": "The story of this game is based on <i>Episode IV: A New Hope</i>, the first of the original  Star Wars movie trilogy. The player initially controls the movie's main hero, Luke Skywalker, but two more controllable characters join later: the careless captain Han Solo and his Wookie side-kick, Chewbacca. The game generally follows the movie plot, allowing the player to experience some of the most important sequences, such as the search for Obi-Wan Kenobi, rescuing princess Leia, and the final confrontation against Death Star and its TIE Fighters, led by the mysterious Darth Vader.\n\nMost of the game levels follow traditional platform gameplay style. As Luke, Han, or Chewbacca, the player makes his way through the linear levels, fighting enemies, jumping over obstacles, and collecting power-ups. The power-ups include standard health-restoring items, upgrades for the blaster gun (up to five different upgrade levels), as well as special items that can be used for massive destruction of the enemies. Luke uses a weak blaster gun, but later gains access to a lightsaber, being able to fight enemies melee-style. Han and Chewbacca use stronger flame guns, but cannot upgrade to better weapons.\n\nSome of the levels are dedicated to familiar Star Wars vehicles (such as a land speeder). Controlling the vehicle from a third-person view, the player has to navigate it through the pseudo-3D environments, avoiding obstacles and shooting at enemies on the way.\n\nThe PlayStation ports of the SNES version have updated controller and display options, leaderboards, new save options, and Trophies.",

      "description": "The sequel to  Super Star Wars is, as the name implies, based on <i>Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back</i>, the second of the original  Star Wars movie trilogy. The game features familiar locations and events from the film, such as the ice planet Hoth, the search for Yoda on the jungle planet Dagobah, and the fight against Darth Vader. Several locations are expanded, adding places and boss enemies that did not exist in the movie, and certain key events in the story are omitted or changed. \n\nAs in the previous game, the player is able to control three characters: Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Chewbacca. Unlike the first, each character has been given a distinct special move. Chewie spins a path of destruction through enemies, Han has grenades and a powerful slide, and Luke can switch to his lightsaber and block oncoming fire. Gameplay is very similar to the first game, mostly focusing on platforming elements. As before, there are Mode-7 vehicle levels, during which the player is able to pilot a snowspeeder against encroaching Imperial walkers, pilot the Millennium Falcon through the asteroid field, and break through Cloud City's defenses in Luke's X-Wing fighter. \n\nThe game's other major addition is the inclusion of a suite of Force powers for Luke. They are learned by collecting hidden orbs on the Dagobah level, and add a second special bar that depletes with each usage of a Force power. Power-ups include health items, weapon upgrades, screen-clearing detonators, and orbs that restore Luke's Force power. Passwords have also been added, and are given upon completion of each of the game's 25 stages.",

      "description": "<i>Spectre</i> is a 3D shooter where the player drives a little red car/tank and blasts away enemies.  The gameplay is similar to Battlezone, and obviously inspired by it.\n\nThere is a selection of three tanks, each with three values (speed; armor; and firepower) balanced out to match its name: Tough Guy is heavy on armor, but slow and not very powerful; Speedy is fast, but low armor; and Balanced combines both strengths, but decreased. A fourth tank allows the player to design a custom variant.\n\nEvery level consists of a large plane filled with enemy tanks, several psychedelic walls with odd images that often flicker or warp resembling an acid trip, and tacky 3D models like windmills.  The object of each level is to either destroy all the enemy tanks in the level, or to collect all the flags. Every level has a certain theme to it, anything from plain green to a colorful blinking eye or images of sand dunes are to be found on the walls, windmills and flags throughout the level.\n\nWith every passing level, enemy tanks grow smarter and their rates of fire increases.  Also in later levels, new, smarter, more powerful enemy tanks join the skirmish. The player has a limited amount of ammo, but driving over ammo deposits replenishes a small amount of ammunition, as well as driving over shield deposits grants additional shields. The three different views (first, third, and top-down) allow the player to incorporate additional strategies into the battles.\n\nThe game boasts having supposedly an infinite amount of levels, though anything after level 80 is almost instant death.  A high score table is also included.\n\nAn additional note-worthy feature of this game is the multi-player mode. Up to eight players are supported over IPX, or NetBios (or two via modem or serial port). The network option offers three Cyberspace Scenarios: <ol><li><b>Arena</b> - free-for-all battles, get one point for each opponent destroyed.</li><li><b>Flag Rally</b> - a match point given for collecting six flags, destroy someone to get any flags being carried.</li><li><b>Base Raid</b> - Akin to \"capture the flag\".  Two teams, two bases; get match point for destroying opponent base.</li></ol>The CD-ROM manual includes a \"Cyberpunk story\", to give background information on the game which consisted of a cyberjock named Hart who lived for the battles in the Arena.",

It appears that his mother died just after giving birth to him, and his father took him on a long journey when he was a little baby, searching for something. Now the boy is six years old, and Papas brings him to his hometown. After some time, they learn that Henry, the prince of Reinhart, was kidnapped by bandits. Papas and his son attempt to rescue him, but this only leads to a tragic event and the boy's imprisonment. Only many years later will the hero discover who or what his father was searching for, and come to realize his own role in the events that dictate the fate of the world.\n\n<i>Dragon Quest V</i> is a Japanese-style role-playing game with random enemy encounters and turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. Though the party only includes three active human combatants, the game allows the player to recruit monsters into it. Some of the enemies will randomly request to join the party. The player can then add them to the roster and use them in battles, where they behave just like any other combatant, using their own abilities and even leveling up.\n\nThe game follows the story of Papas' son stretched over many years, from his childhood to adulthood. The player will be able to choose a wife for the main character from two available female characters. This decision influences some of the subsequent events and features. The hero eventually becomes a parent, and his new family plays a pivotal role in the plot.",

But soon the hero will discover his dream was not so far away from reality...\n\n<i>Dragon Quest VI</i> is the last Super Famicom/SNES game of the <i>Dragon Quest</i> series. It is a party RPG with turn-based combat and battles viewed from first person perspective. Gameplay style, setting, and even menu layout are very similar to those of the previous games in the series. The game utilizes an enhanced \"class system\" from the third game. Characters can choose different classes to belong to, and switch between them. The more a character fights while belonging to a certain class, the more proficient he/she becomes in it. Once two or three starting classes have been mastered, the character gains access to powerful hybrid classes, which grant the characters new abilities and various upgrades.",

      "description": "<i>Operation Thunderbolt</i> is the exciting sequel to <a href=\"http://www.mobygames.com/game/sheet/p,27/gameId,3475\">Operation Wolf</a>. An airliner is hijacked by terrorists en-route from Paris to Boston, who threaten to kill all hostages on board if their mates aren't released from jail. Instead of reaching its destination, the airliner makes a landing in Kalubya, Africa, and all the hostages are hidden in various locations. The authorities have asked the hero from <i>Operation Wolf</i> to rescue the hostages, but only this time, the hero brings his friend along for the ride.\r\n\r\nThere are eight missions to complete in <i>Operation Thunderbolt</i>, and each one has you shooting down soldiers, choppers, and tanks. The gameplay varies every one or two missions. In some missions, you are driving a jeep or controlling a boat, while in others, you are walking while you're shooting. You have a limited supply of ammo, and a limited supply of rocket bombs, but you can always stock up by shooting down crates falling from the sky, or by killing a cat or dog that get in the line of fire. Also from crates, you can get special items like bulletproof vests, rocket bombs, and different weapons.\r\n\r\nYou also have a life bar to worry about. If you're shot at by soldiers, or if rocket bombs or grenades are thrown at you, you 'll lose energy, and once you're energy is depleted,  you lose one of your three lives. You can lose a lot of energy by killing hostages on purpose,  and you can't easily avoid killing them if you decide to use rocket bombs to wipe out enemies. The eighth mission, the mission that involves you fighting terrorists on a plane,  proves to be difficult because a woman in a blue dress stands up and gets in the line of fire, and you have to very careful when you're going to use rocket bombs.\r\n\r\nThere are two endings to this game, and which ending you can watch will depend on the number of hostages you've saved, and whether or not you shot the pilot instead of the mission eight boss. \r\n",

      "description": "A young man lives together with his mother in Kichijoji, a district in modern Tokyo. One day, he has a strange dream: he is being sucked into another dimension, a strange maze-like structure. A spirit appears in front of him and asks him his name. As he proceeds further, he meets a man who is hanging on a cross, another one who is being tormented by a demon, and a mysterious young woman who is bathing in a pool.\n\n\"Wake up!\" - the voice of his mother cuts through the dream. The young man wakes up and checks his computer. Suddenly, a message arrives: the world is headed towards destruction. Only he who can summon demons through a virtual space will be able to prevent a disaster. Unable to understand what that means, the young man goes outside and finds out a murder has occurred in the nearby park. The district must be cut off from the rest of the city until the murderer is found. As the young man acquires a device that allows him to communicate with demons, he begins to realize that his role in the upcoming events may be greater than he thought.\n\nA follow-up to the first two <i>Megami Tensei</i> games, <i>Shin Megami Tensei</i> is a first-person RPG set in modern-day and post-apocalyptic Tokyo. The hero of the game can summon demons, who consume a mysterious energy called Magnetite, which can be obtained from battles. The summoned demon joins the party and is then fully controllable by the player. The active party can include up to six characters: the hero, the heroine, and four slots usually reserved for the demons, though other human characters might also join. There is a wide variety of demons in the game, most of which are taken from real-world mythologies. The demons have levels, individual statistics, spells, special abilities, etc.\n\nEnemy encounters are random, and the first-person combat is turn-based. During combat, human characters can use swords or guns; the heroine is also able to learn and cast magic spells. Unlike most other Japanese RPGs, the game allows the player to raise the parameters of the two main characters manually when leveling up. A major gameplay element are demon conversations, which is usually the only way to recruit demons. Typically, the player has to convince the demon to join the party by choosing appropriate dialogue lines. \n\nAll the creatures in the world of <i>Shin Megami Tensei</i> belong to one of the three ideologies: Law, Chaos, or Neutral. The narrative is largely dedicated to conflicts between these ideologies; during several key moments in the story, the player has to decide which one to follow. Joining one of the ideologies influences the subsequent narrative as well as some gameplay elements: certain weapons can be only equipped by a follower of a specific ideology, demons are more likely to join the hero if he shares their ideology, etc.",

      "description": "Fifty years have passed since the hero of Shin Megami Tensei  followed the neutral path, defeated the leaders of Law and Chaos, and founded a state where followers of both ideologies could live freely. But his reign of freedom doesn't last long. The Messian faith gains power, expanding the Cathedral into a new enclosed environment named Tokyo Millennium. The Gaians rise up, but their rebellion is repressed by the Messians' elite warrior class, the Temple Knights. People flock into the encapsulated city, submitting themselves to the strict hierarchy imposed by the Messian Center, where only the privileged living in the Center district are safe from demonic assaults.\n\nA few years later, a retired arena fighter Okamoto rescues a man named Hawk, who was fighting for his life against a demon. He trains him to fight in the arena of the Valhalla district, hoping that he would win the tournament, which will grant them both citizenship in the Center district. When Hawk succeeds, he is brought before a Messian bishop, and learns the shocking truth about his own origins and the role he is supposed to play in the grand scheme of events. A new battle for a better future begins.\n\n<i>Shin Megami Tensei II</i> retains all the gameplay features of the previous game. The player is able to summon demons, fuse them to create more powerful ones, make them participate in battles, talk to random enemies and receive information from them, etc. The combat is turn-based, and the player explores the complex, maze-like dungeons from a first-person perspective view. Like in the first game, the Law, Chaos, and Neutral alignments play an important role: during the course of the game, the player will have to make choices that influence the alignment of the protagonist, steering the storyline into different directions.\n\nNew features include a \"magic succession\" system, which allows demons to carry over their original magic spells when they are fused into new ones, a few additional spells and abilities, and the possibility to play at the casino and win unique items.",

      "description": "Something terrible has happened in the perfectly ordinary Karukozaka high school. A resentful student named Hazama made contact with a different universe that co-exists with modern-day Japan. As a result, a demon world emerged within the city, its realms corresponding to the seven deadly sins of the humans. With the help of fellow students, the protagonist must investigate the matter and stop the insane plans of the student.\n\n<i>Shin Megami Tensei If...</i> is a side story within the Megami Tensei universe of role-playing games. Visuals and gameplay are largely based on Shin Megami Tensei. The gameplay system contains typical Megami Tensei features such as demon summoning, demon fusion, and the ability to talk to enemies before (or instead of) fighting them. Enemies will react differently depending on the player's approach during conversation. The battles utilize a turn-based engine. A stand-out feature of this installment is the presence of Guardian Spirits: when the protagonist dies in combat, a supernatural entity will aid him or her, affecting attribute advancement when leveling up.",

Even your weapons are reskins that behave exactly like the guns from Wolf3D; Noah must be very skilled to operate a catapult at the speed of a machine gun!.\n\nThe PC version however, while still a reskin of Wolf3D in gameplay has some more advanced features; higher resolution graphics (along the lines of the Jaguar and 3DO versions of the game, albeit with all 8 directions like the original PC version), midi music support, floor textures (like Blake Stone) and a new game play feature in the form of a question mark pickup; picking one up pauses the game and brings up a random multiple choice question about content in the bible. Answer the question correctly and you get a bunch of ammo and points.",

You control Shieru, a young boy who lives in a small village on a planet with a medieval civilization. With the help of his friends, he should fulfill an ancient prophecy and defeat the evil that threatens the planet. In order to do that, the heroes of the game have to recruit demons who will help them in battles.\n\nAs a part of Megaten universe, \"Last Bible III\" is focused on demon summoning and fusion. The concept is more developed in this game, since demons are now fully customizable characters that can level up and be equipped just like human party members. Unlike most Megaten games, \"Last Bible III\" is set in a medieval environment and has a more traditional flair. The battles are viewed from first person perspective in a standard Megaten fashion, but movement on the world map, in towns and in dungeons is controlled from third person perspective with a top-down view.",

Graphics were improved to fit SNES standard, and there were some slight changes made to the interface (to resemble the classic look of  Shin Megami Tensei, especially in the first game).\r\n\r\nThe first  Megami Tensei follows the story of Nakajima, a programmer who has to become a devil summoner in order to stop an invasion from another world. Dungeon navigation and battles are viewed from first person perspective.\r\n\r\n Megami Tensei II puts you in the role of a nameless hero, a member of Devil Buster group who fight demons in a post-apocalyptic world that was caused by an atomic explosion in the end of the 20th century. Dungeon navigation gets a new top-down view in this sequel.",

      "description": "This text-based adventure (with some background graphics) was originally released in Japan over the Satellaview system. The game is a spin-off from the Chrono series, and is the precursor to Chrono Cross. Its main characters and plot elements are very close to those of <i>Chrono Cross</i>; it tells the story of Serge (travelling musician), Kid (thief), and Magil (wizard) as they attempt to steal the Frozen Flame from Viper Manor. The game contains multiple, often humorous endings. \n\nGameplay is something between a standard text adventure and a visual novel. Rather than having a full array of possible actions, players are limited to the several options it presents at any time.  With newly discovered items and information, new areas can be reached.  Occasionally battles will occur during the exploration, which are also handled by displaying several possible actions to choose between, such as \"Run\" or \"Jump back as it swings!\"",

With the power of the cards he begins his adventure.\n\n<i>Arcana</i> is a first-person RPG which focuses on the exploration of varied dungeon settings. A village serves as hub in which Rooks can visit places like a fortune teller or shops to buy items and equipment. On the world map, which does not offer free movement, he chooses his next destination where the dungeon crawl begins. The battles occur randomly and are turn-based: during each turn, the player chooses the next action of a character from a list of actions, e.g. attack or magic.\nEventually the characters advance their experience level and therefore their stats.\n\nThe main visual characteristic of the game is the display of monsters and characters: everything is represented with cards. They can have an elemental attribute or not.  Rooks is able to summon an elemental to aid him.  He can only summon one type at a time, and he must find them before being able to summon them. Two more characters can join the party.",

Alex, a descendant of one of those heroes, enjoys a peaceful life in the town of Rysis ans is about to marry his sweetheart Katarina. However, a mysterious wizard interferes and kidnaps the young woman. Alex embarks on a quest to locate and defeat him, unraveling an even more nefarious scheme in the process.\n\n<i>Dragon View</i> is an action role-playing game and a follow-up to Drakkhen. Like its predecessor, it features a 3D overworld navigated from a first-person perspective. Towns and dungeons, however, are presented as side-scrolling areas. Alex can jump and fight enemies appearing in the dungeons with a sword or other weapons he can later acquire, such as a boomerang and a bow. Experience points are awarded for vanquishing enemies, and Alex's strength and defense parameters increase when leveling up. HP and magic points increase by finding specific items. It is also possible to find magical rings and weapon upgrades.",

      "description": "<i>Super Chase H.Q.</i> is an enhanced sequel to Chase H.Q. As usual, you must drive your way towards a criminal's vehicle, which is known to be involved in some crime, while avoiding passing cars to gain points. Your car also comes equipped with three turbos, which can be useful if you are way behind the vehicle.\n\nBut this time, cars aren't just the only things that you have to worry about. You will also encounter bikes that shoot or throw firebombs at you, as well as cars that go the wrong way. (If you crash into one of these, you'll be sent flying through the air.) Not to mention other obstacles such as barricades.\n\nFurthermore, as well as the criminal's damage indicator, you also have your own. When you finally catch up with each criminal,  they are likely to shoot at you if you get too close to their vehicle, but you may encounter criminals who have different ways of attacking you. The fourth criminal, for example, launches a missile at you if you are further behind him. Once you are shot at and hit, your indicator decreases for every time you are hit, but this rule does not apply when you're hit by passing cars. When your indicator is empty or when you're out of time, the game ends.\n\nWhen you complete each round, a statistics screen will appear, and you are awarded points based on the time remaining, how much damage you've done, and the number of nitros that are used. One of the options allow you to display the game's speedometer in either MPH or Km/h. The game also has a storyline, which can be viewed in between rounds.",

      "description": "Based on the manga series <i>3x3 Eyes</i>, the game tells the story of a young man named Yakumo Fujii. He lives in Tokyo and enjoys a life of an average teenager: he studies in school, works as a waiter on a part-time job, hangs around with friends, and so on. But one day, he meets a mysterious girl named Pai. Pai is the sole survivor of an ancient race called \"sanzhiyan\" (Chinese for \"three eyes\"). Long ago, they discovered the secret of immortality, but as a result they lost their human form, and some of them mutated into horrible demons. Pai's dream is to become human again. Yakumo's father was her trusty friend, but he died, and wished his son would continue helping Pai. At first Yakumo doesn't feel very enthusiastic about that, but through a bizarre accident his nature becomes inseparable from Pai's, and he becomes immortal himself. He has no choice but to help Pai. They travel around the world, from Hong-Kong to Mexico, seeking their lost humanity, and fighting the remains of the demonic race.\n\n<i>3x3 Eyes: Seima K\u014drinden</i> is a Japanese-style RPG set in modern times. Player-controlled characters can travel from location to location by plane, or riding Pai's winged demon. On their journey Yakumo and Pai meet other characters who join the party, and visit cities and dungeons, where they fight enemies in turn-based style. Battles are viewed from first-person perspective. Every character has various spells and techniques which can be used in battles.",

Ray is told about the evil wizard Homncruise, who plans to conquer the world. Defeating Homncruise won't be easy: first Ray must find the magic crest of his fallen father, and build a strong team of legendary warriors, named Aquitallion. Only then will he and his comrades be ready to face Homncruise and save the world.\n\nIn this game you wander around the world map, visiting towns and dungeons, and fighting monsters in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective, much like in <i>Dragon Quest</i> games. You'll have two parties at your disposal, and will be able to switch between them at any time. One party is the Aquitallion, the \"main\" one, and the only one which can access plot-progressing areas. The other parties can be used for visiting dungeons and retrieving valuable items. At a certain point in the game, you'll also be able to build and manage your own town.",

      "description": "The game is set in the end of Edo period in Japan (1600-1868). Japan, controlled by the feudal rulers (shoguns) of the Tokugawa dynasty, consumed by a peaceful sleep for three hundred years, was awoken by the arrival of the Westerners. It seemed that they only wanted the end of Japan's isolation from the rest of the world. But their true purpose was to take control of a mysterious Japanese energy source called reiketsu. To protect those sources, that were running dry during their three hundred years-long reign, the Tokugawa Shoguns formed the famous Shinsengumi special force. In addition to its primary mission of clearing out forces that would try to overthrow the shogunate, there also existed a special branch of them called \"Shadow Shinsengumi\". The duty of the \"Shadow\" was to take care of \"those things the human hand cannot manage\"...\n\nYou control Yamatomaru, a strong-willed sixteen-year-old boy who lives in Iida village, near Koufu. His father has recently passed away. After failing to defeat a monster in his village, he was saved by one of the Shadow Shinsengumi man, Mibu Juurota. As he receives his father's katana, he goes on his first mission - rescuing boys who were trapped in a mountain path. Soon the plot thickens and the young hero becomes involved in mystical struggles between the forces who try to control reiketsu...\n\nThe gameplay is similar to Dragon Quest  series and other Japanese-style RPGs: the battles are random, turn-based, and are viewed from first-person perspective. You fight using physical attacks and a variety of special moves based on spiritual energy. An unusual addition to the gameplay is the karma system. By doing good deeds you can increase your karma level, in an Ultima-like way. This way you get more money and precious items from fighting monsters, and your special powers increase in strength. If you don't show compassion, steal people's things and lie, your karma will decrease, you won't get money from random battles, and some people will attack you. ",

      "description": "In the future, many military forces are dependent on huge mech robots, called Wanzers (Walking Panzers) for combat. At Huffman Island, located in the the pacific ocean, wanzers are deployed by both the USN (United States of the New Continent) and the OCU (Oceana Community Union), who dispute ownership over the island.  One night, the OCU forces stage a covert recon mission on a facility located in Larcus, a USN-held territory and weapons facility. Lead by a soldier named Roid, this mission was entirely unofficial and violated the peace treaty. During the mission, USN forces lead by Commander Driscoll appeared and ambushed the OCU soldiers. During the combat, Roid's fiance, Karen is killed and the USN facility is blown up; placing the blame on the OCU. This became known as the \"Larcus Incident\" and the OCU denied all knowledge of it's soldiers actions. Ultimately it would be a leading cause to the second Huffman War. \n\nOne year later, the war is underway and Huffman island is under provisional control of the OCU, but with a weakened military unable to defend against USN attacks. The soldiers involved in the Larcus Incident have all been discharged and disgraced. Roid spends his time fighting as a gladiator in the Wanzer fighting arena before being approached by a mysterious man. Colonel Olson has found out about Roid's history and wants him to command a mercenary unit he is assembling on behalf of the OCU, dubbed \"Carrion Crow\". Convincing Roid that Driscoll is still out there on the island, Roid agrees.\n\n<i>Front Mission</i> is a turn-based strategy RPG played from an isometric perspective. Players progress in the story through large strategic battles involving multiple units and cutscenes between them. At certain places, usually towns, the player can visit multiple locations including bars and shops, and talk to people. Shops are also found to purchase new weaponry, parts and make repairs. In combat, each Wanzer robot is a separate unit that has a large variety of weapons and attack styles depending on what's equipped.

Gene doesn't yet know that fate will make his path cross with that of the \"good\" hero Lux, with whom he shares a mysterious connection...\n\nGene must complete the missions of the Demon King in a specified order, and each time he completes a mission, his rank raises, allowing him access to higher levels of the hierarchy of the Demon King Castle, new abilities, etc. Other servants of the Demon King join him on his mission, and fight together with him as a party. The battles are turn-based and are viewed from first-person perspective. The game has an internal clock with day and night cycle.",

      "description": "Three-hundred years ago, there were two kingdoms on the earth - Reyfore, ruled by the benevolent and mighty king Reynard, and Amugnon, ruled by king Daruk. The two kingdoms could have lived in peace, but pride took over king Daruk, he didn't respect the Goddess any more, and as a result his mind became obsessed by the idea of destruction. Daruk attacked Reyfore, and for decades war was embracing the two kingdoms, setting the Earth in flames. After a prolonged battle, king Reynard defeated king Daruk, and a reign of prosperity began once again.\n\nBut can evil be truly defeated? The hero of the game, a young adventurer, falls down from a cliff while taking a stroll near the ancient Sophia Temple. He is saved by an old man who lives with his daughter Refia in a small country house. But one day, a demonic-looking knight appears, accompanied by monsters, kills the old man, and kidnaps Refia. The old man recognized the knight - it was king Daruk! Now the hero must bring Refia back and defeat Daruk once and for all.\n\nThe game has a less linear structure than a standard Japanese-style RPG: together with the main story there are many missions, or \"scenarios\", which are not obligatory to complete, but which occupy a large portion of the game. In the beginning of the game you create a party of four characters, the hero and his three companions. The battles are pre-determined and take place on the same screen as the gameworld itself. Your party and the enemies can move freely around the screen and attack with melee and ranged weapons, and their actions depend on the amount of action points they have. Navigation in town is menu-based.",

Naturally, Bulma is not the only one needing those Balls, so that the young hero will soon have to face and defeat some bad guys, including his first true rival Piccolo.\n\nThe game puts you in control of Son Goku only during battles or when there is a possibility to make a choice and to influence the storyline. There is no other gameplay in the game except fighting and picking answers from menu. The fights are one-on-one: you pause them by pressing the start button, and then program Son Goku, making him execute various moves: dash, kick, special attack, etc. Every attack can be countered by an enemy attack, and you have to follow the enemy's move pattern in order to attack and defend successfully.",

      "description": "This is a direct sequel to the  first \"interactive fighter\" for SNES, based on the popular manga/anim\u00e9 series <i>Dragon Ball</i>. The game picks up the story where it ended in the previous game, and continues through Piccolo, Saiyajin, and Freezer sagas of the manga. After the battle with the Demon King (Daimaou) Piccolo, the twenty-third World Martial Arts Tournament is about to begin. But to the amazement of the hero Son Goku and his friends, their archrival Piccolo appears during the tournament, so that it quickly turns into a genuine battle.\n\nYou control Son Goku and his son Son Gohan, switching between them as the game progresses. The game is basically an interactive comic book in which you can influence the story by choosing to press a button when the game prompts you to make a choice. You'll also participate in battles. The battle system is similar to rock-paper-scissors game, where one kind of move always beats or always loses to another. You can dash into your enemies, attack physically, and perform special moves, pressing the buttons in real time (although the battles are divided into turns).",

      "description": "The town Newcam, Massachusetts, 1924. On the outskirts of the town stands the Weathertop mansion. It was just an ordinary place until the last owner, Benedict Weathertop, started practicing black magic. He killed his parents and populated the mansion with all kinds of undead. Since then, nobody dared to approach the mansion. But a short while ago, two boys were found dead near this horrible place. Apparently, the boys had tried to enter the mansion. Another evidence pointed out that a girl followed them - but her body hasn't been found yet, and there is a slight hope she might be alive. This is where you, the hero of the game, decide to investigate the mystery, and to venture into the mansion...\n\n<i>Laplace no Ma</i> (Devil of Laplace) is a Japanese-style RPG with horror elements, somewhat similar to Sweet Home for NES. Unlike <i>Sweet Home</i>, this game is more oriented towards RPG gameplay. You are not stuck in the mansion, but can leave it, visit the town, and buy supplies. Later you also visit other locations such as a castle, etc. The battles are random, turn-based, and are viewed from first-person perspective. The hero of the game can recruit three other characters to the party of five available. Each character (including the hero, to whom you assign gender and class) belongs to one of the five character classes: Dilettante, Medium, Detective, Scientist, or Journalist. Dilettante is an all-around character with defensive magic, Medium is a kind of a black mage, Detective is a melee fighter, Scientist can construct powerful machines to perform various techniques, and the Journalist can take pictures of the monsters, which is the only way to gain money in the game.",

The game is set in a world of Andell - a floating continent where ancient prophecies and highly advanced technology co-exist. A curse has fallen onto Andell - its four island, once united, are now separated, and are floating away from the heart of the continent, the temple of Andell. The sages of the temple summon a great hero named Farse, who must find a special magic orb for each one of the islands, which is the only way to re-unite them. Farse embarks on his journey, aided by three Terranos, the big-eared inhabitants of Andell.\n\nThis is a Japanese-style RPG where you control a party containing the main hero Farse and three Terranos you select out of the available five. You encounter random enemies and bosses and fight them in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. You can use special attacks and magical spells, which don't consume magic points, but take away a certain amount of your hit points. Instead of healing items, you have mini-bottles you can refill with potions in special places in towns. You can equip various magical artifacts which will allow you to use magic spells belonging to eight different elements.",

      "description": "\"Maten Densetsu\" is a RPG set in post-apocalyptic Japan, similar in style and in gameplay to  Shin Megami Tensei and other  Megaten games.\r\n\r\nYou find yourself in the middle of the Tokyo district Akihabara. But is this really Akihabara? The buildings have turned into ruins, and you wander around the deserted streets without any idea of how you could possibly be in such a place. A strange giant head appears in front of you, and defeats you in battle. When you wake up, you find out that Japan is floating in the air, and is attacked by a mysterious force that spawned countless demons who brought destruction to the cities. People are hiding among rubble and in underground passages. Some of them are fighting the demons, joining an organization called Self-Defense Forces. The hero's first objective is to find a way to his home district Shinjuku, where he will obtain more information about the power that threatens Japan, and discover mysterious artifacts from an unknown civilization, called <i>ooparts</i> (out-of-place artifacts).\r\n\r\nYou can play as either one of the five characters presented to you in the beginning of the game: Rage, Rai, Hokuto, Seigi, and Daigo, each one having his own initial strengths and weaknesses. The entire game plays from first-person perspective. You navigate a cursor over the city map and check out your radar device to find out places of interest. The claustrophobic, extremely complex first-person 3D dungeons have a distinct <i>Shin Megami Tensei</i> flair. The battles are random and turn-based. Your main character doesn't gain levels, but instead accumulates energy points which can be then distributed freely to raise his strength, mental power, defense, etc. Certain characters join your party later in the game, and there are also friendly demons who would join you if you choose a correct way of behavior when you encounter them.",

The heroine of the manga (and of the game) is Lina Inverse, a seventeen-year-old girl who can use magic and is also proficient with the sword. Lina particularly likes money, and often robs rich people and hunts for treasure. She also has a sense for justice - if a village or a town is in trouble, Lina will do anything to protect it and fight the bad guys. In the game, Lina is knocked down after a fight against mysterious attackers, and is found by the inhabitants of the nearby village. The trouble is, she can't remember anything! When she meets her long-time companion Naga, their first objective become to investigate the goblin attacks on the population, but Lina's ultimate quest is to regain her memory and find out who or what has attacked her.\n\nThe game is a traditional Japanese-style RPG with towns, dungeons, random enemies, and turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective, in Dragon Quest fashion. The characters can attack physically or use special attacks. Lina can also cast various magical spells. There is no overworld character navigation; instead, the player selects locations on the map for instant travel. The game features anime-style cutscenes.",

It is divided into a Novice-, Expert-, and Master class, with each class featuring four unique tracks.\r\nIn Stunt Trax the player has to complete courses filled with obstacles within a certain time limit while trying to collect as many stars as possible.\r\nBattle Trax is a two player mode taking place on special tracks without any CPU-controlled opponents.\r\nFinally, Test Run let's the player practice all tracks that have been unlocked.",

      "description": "<i>Dragon Slayer: The Legend of Heroes</i> tells the story of a young prince named Selios. One day his old teacher Raiyas sends him to a nearby cave to retrieve a magic weapon. When the prince returns, he finds the house attacked by monsters. Raiyas tells him to seek help in the castle of a baron, whose country has always been allies with theirs for a long time. However, the baron betrays Selios' trust and imprisons him. The young prince manages to escape, but without the possibility to return he has no choice but to wander through the land, trying to find trustworthy companions who would help him to save his country.\n\nThis is a traditional medieval-themed Japanese RPG with turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective (like in  Dragon Warrior games). The enemies are semi-random: they do appear out of nowhere and attack suddenly, but they are visible on the screen, and if you flee from a battle they will still be there to pursue you.\n",

Selios married his sweetheart Dina, and they had a child, whom they gave the name Atlas. At the age of fifteen, Atlas was already a strong warrior, thanks to the lessons of his teacher Lowel. Everything seemed peaceful in the country, until two warriors spotted strange creatures near the capital city. Those were... men in space suits! Of course, the warriors could not have known this and believed them to be monsters. Do the mysterious strangers have peaceful intentions, or are they a new threat to the kingdom?\n\nThe second <i>Dragon Slayer</i> is very similar to the first game, graphically and gameplay-wise. The only major difference is the fact that the enemies are now completely visible on screen before battles, so that the player can avoid fighting them if he wants to. Otherwise, it is a traditional Japanese RPG with turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. The Genesis version has once again updated graphics.",

A girl named Yoko was found murdered near a central bridge. During the investigation, you discover a strange rumor about a mysterious ghost-like \"girl who stands at the back\", spread around the school Yoko studied at. Soon the young detective realizes that the case grows more and more complex and that he will need all his wit and talents to find the criminal!\r\n\r\nThis adventure game is dedicated entirely to investigation. You have a menu with various choices (Talk, Investigate, Think), as well as multiple topics to ask the suspects about. You should find clues by questioning people and gathering information, but also by examining areas - in certain places you should move a hand-like cursor over the screen and click on a precise spot to examine it.",

When he grew up, he defeated the evil demons from the Demon Island, and three years later found a way to save his land from the wrath of Emma, the King of Hell. But a new threat has appeared now! The demonic king Basara sends his henchman Karura to the moon, to kidnap Kaguya-hime, the legendary Moon Princess, in order for her to marry his son, Prince Daida. Momotar\u014d  prepares his magic carriage and flies to the moon, attempting to rescue Kaguya-hime. But he doesn't suspect how strong his foes really are...\n\nThe sequel to the first two <i>Momotar\u014d Densetsu</i> games is very similar to its predecessors in terms of gameplay. Moving around Momotar\u014d and his party members over the world map (which has become 3D by now), you visit towns, buy weapons and accessories, talk to people, and fight random enemies and bosses in turn-based combat viewed from first person perspective.",

You are a high-school student, whose father is a famous archaeologist traveling around the world, and whose mother died when he was a child. It is now your third year at the 88 High School, and naturally, your primary concern is your love life. Will you be able to date successfully and to come to a happy ending with one of the fifteen lovely female classmates?\n\nThe game mechanics are a lot like in a \"standard\" adventure game (examine objects, visit various locations, talk to people, make decisions), but the plot centers exclusively around your relationship with the girls. The game has its own internal clock. You can move around your character on a \"city map\", visiting different locations. Every visit takes 20-30 minutes of game time. You can make appointments and visit various places at a specific time. The decisions you make influence the story.",

      "description": "The world of Kypros is populated by many races: humans, intelligent reptiles, dog-like wosshus, and others. There are also many gods in Kypros. Not all the gods could accept the peaceful co-existence of creatures in Kypros, and Daar, the god of darkness, plotted evil schemes until he was defeated and sealed by the god of light, Risk. Years have past, and the evil demon lord Bido is trying to resurrect Daar. According to an ancient prophecy, only eight heroes, the bearers of magic pearls, can stop Bido's evil plans: eight heroes who come from different parts of Kypros, unaware of their great mission. Among those heroes are the young pirate Zan Hayate, the fighter of the wosshu tribe Gonza and his little sister Maimai, the beautiful sorceress Lilian Lancelot, and others. \n\nBefore the eight heroes unite for their ultimate journey, you play their introductory stories. You travel on the world map, visiting towns and dungeons on your way. The combat is turn-based, viewed from first person perspective. Enemies appear randomly. Each hero has his/her own unique techniques to use in battles.\n\nThe story and general gameplay of <i>Burai: Hachigyoku no Y\u016bshi Densetsu</i> is similar to those of the original <moby game=\"Burai: J\u014dkan\n\">Burai: J\u014dkan for computers; however, the console versions were developed from scratch and therefore differ greatly from the computer ones, having new cutscenes, dialogues, battle interface, etc. Perhaps the most important difference gameplay-wise is the linear nature of chapters. In the computer versions, the player can choose to start as any of the eight selectable heroes; in the console versions, the player has to start with Gonza and Maimai.",

A typical button masher, includes 10 events (100m sprint, 110m hurdles, pole vault, long jump, triple jump, javelin, high jump, discus, skeet and archery) and 32 countries around the world compete in custom or full Olympics, or just practice. Two players can compete head to head in the sprinting events, and a total of eight can play in the same game. Three difficulty levels allow competitive events for both rookies to veterans in the genre.\r\n\r\nSprinting events are a short and straight button mashing frenzy. 4 athletes compete simultaneously, the first winner advancing to the next round (two qualifiers and then the medal run). Only fast fingers and quick shotgun reaction can earn world record times. \r\n\r\nJumping events are a mix of shorter button mashing bursts combined with timely pressed jumps. From the straight forward high and long jump events (run and then set the jump angle) to the more elaborate triple jump (as the name suggests, three jumps must be carefully measured for world class results) and the complex pole vault, where a strong run must be followed by a sharp pole fixation and good a release upwards. Both long jump and triple jump have a first round composed by three jumps, the better eight progress into the second round, where they are given three more jumps. In the high jump and pole vault the competition continues until all athletes miss three consecutive jumps.\r\n\r\nThe throwing events (discus and javelin) work in the same fashion as the jumping events, although trickier to pull, as the setting of the angle must be followed by a timely release. Each player is entitled to three throws, the top eight allowed three more attempts.\r\n\r\nFinally, the shooting events. Archery is a three-round competition where the goal is to amass as many points as possible by shooting at the inner rings of the target. With six arrows per round, each shot must be calculated according to the wind, choosing between steady aim and lower tension (must be aimed upwards and compensating the wind) or higher tension but a jumpy aim (can be aimed directly at the \"gold\" points). Skeet is a five round competition where the goal is to hit five clay pigeons before they disappear off-screen with two slugs for each. ",

      "description": "<i>The Lawnmower Man</i> is the game based on the 1992 movie of the same name (itself loosely based on a Stephen King short story)  starring pre-Bond fame Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Lawrence Angelo, a scientist working for Virtual Space Industries in \"Project 5\", a secret research that attempts to increase the intelligence of primates using psychotropic drugs and VR training. \n\nWith his reluctance to aim the research to military purpose, after one of the chimps escapes and shoots a guard in the process he is given a forced vacation, and while taking notes on the need for experiment with a human subject, he notices Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a simpleton who makes his living on odd jobs such as mowing the grass (hence, the title role). The first experiments quickly increase Jobe's intelligence, and while after an accident Angelo stopped the experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing Project 5, reinserted the drugs responsible for violent behaviour into the program and sped up the treatment. As Jobe starts to develop telekinetic powers, he starts to take revenge on those who abused him before he started the treatments, and plots to take over all computers in the world.\n\nWhile the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is an interactive movie, both cartridge versions are platformers, the player taking control of Dr. Angelo or Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe's best friend) in typical side-scrolling shooting action. The player can collect better weapons or data discs, which after collecting a number of them allow to morph into the Virtual Suit, which gives protection against a first hit. The player visits several locations seen in the movie, such as the gas pump and the VSI headquarters. \n\nThe twists of the game are true-3D level connectors, based on the CG sequences of the movie, usually all involving avoiding obstacles (and the occasional shooting) at high speed in the VR world. There are four different (Virtual World, Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), each taking a slightly different approach (Virtual World is seen in first person, the objective being dodging obstacles such as trees and archs and reach the exit, Cyber War similar to Virtual World but with some shooting stops, Cyber Run is seen in third person and requires occasional shooting of obstacles, while Cyber Tube is a fast travel with plenty of enemies in a VR tunnel).",

It is possible play solo, with a friend in split screen or with split screen against the computer, and if music or engine sounds are played in the race.\r\nA key choice in the game is selecting between Arcade and Simulation mode - in the later, the car can take a lot less damage before giving up, fine-tuning must be done by the driver and rules are enforced, under the risk of a disqualification.\r\n\r\nGraphically, the game is less sterile than most driving games of the platform (and in 16-bit consoles, generally), thanks to the inclusion of several polygonal buildings scattered around the circuits.",

You have the ability to turn on or off weather (during rainy days the graphics are darker and the bike has less traction). The number of laps on each course can be 5, 10 or 15, and there are 4 skill levels. Some changes have been made to how the vehicle handles, to emphasize the switch from cars to bikes.",

      "description": "The game's setting and style closely resemble the movie <i>The Road Warrior</i> (\"Mad Max 2\"). Your objective is to drive your car through the wasteland, trying to survive motorcycle gang members' attacks and to avoid running out of gas.\n\nThe gameplay is a split of two genres: racing and side-scrolling. In the racing parts you have to destroy enemies like motorcycle gang members, gyro-copter captains, red trucks, etc. Your car has a machine-gun installed in its front, and if some guy drives along side of you, a little window pops up, allowing you to shoot them with your shotgun.\n\nAlong the road there are several towns, and every time you pass through one of them, an alarm will warn you. As your gas run low, you have to stop on these towns and refuel your reserves of gas and ammo. When doing so, the game turns to a side-scrolling perspective, as you get out of your car, dealing with your enemies in hand-to-hand combats. In the cities you'll also find new equipment to your car, such as missile launchers, nitro, etc.",

It is up to Shien to defeat them and rescue Aska from these creatures beyond the Time Gate.\n\n<i>Shien's Revenge</i> is a first-person Operation Wolf-style shooter that puts the player in the role of Shien the ninja. Movement is automatically controlled by the game, which scrolls horizontally or vertically. The player must use his weapons, long-range shuriken (throwing stars) and a close-range dagger in order to defeat various enemy ninjas and creatures that appear on the screen. A set of candles indicate the player's life meter. Power-ups such as rapid fire and scrolls can be picked up by defeating enemies. The use of scrolls produces a powerful attack that damages everything on the screen. At the end of each area, the player encounters a boss who must be defeated through the depletion of its life meter.",

      "description": "The Romulans request permission to enter the Neutral Zone in order to search for a team of their researchers that they claim has gone missing. The USS Enterprise is sent to monitor their activities and find out their real motives.\n\nGameplay is divided into three parts: commanding the Enterprise from the bridge, controlling an away team on a planetary mission and combat with other ships.\n\nFrom the bridge you can control all of the ships main functions. <i>Conn</i>: Set course to a different planet or sector. Communication:  <i>Communicate</i>: with other ships. <i>Sensors</i>: Receive information on your surroundings or planets you are orbiting. <i>Computer</i>: Access a database that contains lots of information on planets, races, technology, your crew etc. <i>Engineering</i>: If the Enterprise got damaged during combat, you can use this command to allocate resources to the different parts of the ship that need to be repaired. <i>Briefing Room</i>: Receive orders and information on your current mission. <i>Tactical</i> Station: Engage in combat. <i>Transporter</i>: Assemble an away team and beam it down to a planet (which is only possible if your current mission requires it).\n\nBefore starting an away mission, you have to assemble a team of four crew members that differ in strength and in tactical and technical ability. Some crew members also have special abilities, Dr. Crusher can heal other crew members, Geordi and Data can see in the dark and Data can survive without air. Away missions are shown from a top-down perspective and you can control each team member individually or order different members to follow your currently selected character around. Most away missions are a mixture of simple (real time) combat and puzzle solving that usually consists getting hints from tricorder readings and finding objects that have to be used in the correct way.\n\nShip battles are also seen from a top-down perspective and let you attack enemy ships with phasers and photon torpedoes, while keeping an eye or your shields and trying to dodge you enemy's torpedoes. If your ship too heavily damaged you can surrender and hope that your enemy spares you.\n\nWhile the SNES and Genesis versions are essentially the same game, there are some noticeable differences. The Genesis version plays considerably faster during ship battles and on away missions as well as on the bridge (meaning it takes much less time to repair the ship). There are many graphical differences and the map layout for away missions is slightly different from the SNES version as well. \n",

      "description": "A young boy has a strange dream every night, where a voice calls him. In this dream there's a magical kingdom called Enderia. The queen of Enderia and her daughters were kidnapped by the demon Akuma, who now reigns supreme. The boy must enter the dreamworld, defeat the demon and rescue the nobility.\n\n<i>Yume Meiky\u016b: Kigurumi Daib\u014dken</i> is a first-person dungeon crawler with step-movement and random encounters that plays like a simplified version of the Dungeon Master series template, albeit with a turn-based engine. One of the main differences is the presentation: instead of the usual dank and dark dungeon with grim walls covered by rusty chains, this game has surfaces made of cake and candy. Instead of skeletons and orcs as enemies, it features furry and cute anthropomorphic animals. Once defeated, these creatures occasionally leave behind their skin, which the hero can collect and wear for a change in statistics and new abilities. They also sometimes drop candy, the game's currency. There are several shops on each level: a tailor shop to change and store skins (it is possible to carry a maximum of six skins), shops for potions and health boosts, etc.\n\nWhen a random enemy encounter occurs, a menu with the options of fighting or escaping appears. After choosing to fight, another menu pops up, which includes the commands Punch, Kick, Talent, Defend, and Item. After choosing either of the first two the player is presented with a grid where an icon (a fist or a foot) can be positioned over a part of the enemy body. This provides a strategic element to the game, as different enemies have different weak spots that can be exploited. The Talent option accesses the special ability that a skin may possess.",

      "description": "A follow-up to the original Math Blaster! games, <i>Math Blaster: In Search of Spot</i> is an educational title with arcade elements designed to help students learn maths while having fun.\n\nThe game allows students to practice basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division skills in addition to fractions, decimals, percents, estimation, and number patterns. The subjects can be practiced separately or together in review. Six levels of difficulty are provided. Like the previous titles, the game also includes an editor to create new problem sets (present in the PC version only).\n\nMath Blaster's friend and assistant, Spot, is kidnapped by the evil Trash Alien at the beginning of the game. The Galactic Commander gives Math Blaster the mission to follow the Trash Alien to his home planet and rescue Spot.\n\nThe game starts with a complete mission (story mode). The mission consists of a series of four (three in the console versions) math activities (mini-games) strung together with cut-scenes. The activities can also be played separately, for practice or for score.\n\nThe activities are as follows:<ul><li>Trash Zapper - Solve equations to gain tractor beam power, then use the tractor beam to collect space trash.</li><br>\n<li>Number Recycler (PC version only) - Create equations by pushing around columns of numbers and operators. Correct equations allow you to turn the trash you collected into fuel.</li><br>\n<li>Cave Runner - Use Math Blaster's jet pack to fly through a cave. He has a number on his chest, and it must be arithmetically between the numbers on each side of an opening in order for him to pass through. Droplets of water falling from above can change this number by performing an operation on it. There are also gems which can be collected for bonus points, and in higher levels, monsters appear that can knock Math Blaster down.</li><br>\n<li>Math Blaster - The Trash Alien's spaceship displays an equation, and the four portholes serve as multiple-choice answers. Use the jet pack to fly into the correct portholes while avoiding floating trash and energy blasts from the ship. Bonus gems also appear at random, and after five problems a bonus round occurs where players get a chance to collect as many gems as they can within a time limit.</li></ul>Upon finishing the complete mission, the player is presented with a certificate that can be printed out (PC version only). Their final score is also added to a high score board for their account.",

The emphasis of <i>Super Scope 6</i>'s gameplay is on first person shooting, using the required Super Scope accessory to aim. It features a total of six game modes, categorized as either <i>Blastris</i> or <i>LaserBlazer</i>.\n\n<i>Blastris Mode</i> features a variety of unrelated games.\n<ul><li><b>Blastris A</b> is a falling block game based on Tetris and plays very similar. Blocks appear on the left side of the screen and move towards the right side of the screen, where they will fit into play. The goal is to have the blocks on any column line up and destroy themselves. Each level requires five of these to happen. Unlike <i>Tetris</i>, the player cannot move or even rotate blocks. Instead each section of the block can be destroyed by shooting it. Higher difficulty levels increase the speed of gameplay</li>\n<li><b>Blastris B</b> is a falling block game based on Columns and Puyo Puyo. On each screen are a number of \"jelly blocks\" which must be destroyed to complete the stage. New blocks appear at the top of the screen and move towards the bottom where they fit into play. Blocks can be destroyed by lining up a row of 4 blocks of the same colour.

Operation Desert Storm featured many different types of units including mobile armor. The M1 Abrams tank division is deployed in a variety of missions to destroy marked Iraqi targets.\n\n<i>Super Battletank: War in the Gulf</i> is a 1st person tank simulation. Players sit in the cockpit of a M1 Abrams tank. Controls allow the player to accelerate forward, decelerate, rotate the tank's trajectory left and right, move the tank's cannon left and right, fire the weapon and check the map. The goal of the player is to travel to the location of enemy targets, line them up with the Abrams cannon and fire upon them until destroyed. Each mission covers a large area of land and the player will need to consult the real-time map to travel appropriately to target locations. The M1 Abrams tank also features 2 special weapons: The laser which is more powerful than regular cannon, and the smoke screen which allows the player to escape.",

The player must now guide their efforts in trying to throw over the Kyllen. \n\n<i>War 3010</i> is a turn-based strategy game in which players move spaceships over a grid-map. There are different types of ships, such as Fighters, Marauders or Destroyers, that differ in movement range and weapon power. Weapon power is also divided into long and short range, i.e. a ship that is very good at long range combat may have poor close ranged weapons etc. During combat, the following actions can be chosen from a menu: Movement, Attacking, terrain information, unit information, a map of the battlefield, overview of all units, including those of the enemy; and an option to scout planets for technology. When an attacking unit is within range of an attacked unit, the attacked unit will always counter-attack (if it isn't destroyed first). In later missions it becomes possible to scout planets for technology and upgrade ships, as well as take control of space stations to build new ships. Ships cannot be taken into the next mission however.",

Along with his sidekick Mo Crash and even more importantly his six-gun he will try to accomplish this task.\n\nThe game takes place over a week with each day being a different stage. Stages are broken down into 4 parts. The first part is a training section where players can practice shooting. The next two parts are action scenes. In the action scenes, gameplay consists of moving a cross-hair over various enemies and shooting them. The final part ends the day with a showdown. The showdown involves a one on one duel in which a draw icon will randomly pop up anywhere on the screen which must be shot then immediately afterwards the enemy the player is facing then must also be shot. This continues on until either the player's or the enemy's life bar is drained.\n\nIf a player doesn't shoot an energy canteen during a level a bonus screen will appear. The bonus screen shows a woman spinning around on a round board with stars next to her body. Shooting the stars without missing and without accidentally shooting the woman will help players pick up large amounts of money.\n\nAt the end of a level the amount of money made is tallied up. For every bullet wasted and damage taken the player loses money. The player gains money equal to the their accuracy and the amount of energy they had left at the end of the stage.",

Player can fish in: <i>Skywater Lake (Local Amateur)</i>, <i>Clear Lake (Amateur)</i>, <i>Murphy Lake (Pro)</i> and <i>Bluestone Lake (Super Bass)</i>, the goal of which is to catch a certain weight limit of bass before a certain time limit.\n\nThere are two screens, the boating screen where players navigate a lake using the D-Pad to navigate, the \"A\" button for acceleration and the \"B\" button for reverse.  The \"Y\" button is used to enter the fishing screen.  There is also a fish finder on the lower part of the screen that helps the player in locating a good place to fish.\n\nWhen the player enters the \"fishing screen\", they can use the \"L & R\" shoulder buttons to increase the distance meter, the \"X\" button brings up the lure selection screen, the \"B\" button can bring an overhead view of the location the player currently has the lure set for and the \"Y\" button brings the player back to the \"boat mode\".  To cast, the player presses the \"A\" button once to start the cast meter and a pressing it again when the meter is set at a certain limit to cast it.\n\nWhile fishing, the player will have an overhead top-down mode of the lake, using the \"A\" button to reel in their lure and using the D-Pad to manipulate movement of the lure.  Fish can be seen through the water, outlined in a light color while bigger fish are seen stationary and cast in a dark shadow.  Once the player hooks the fish, a meter will show up at the bottom, showing the tension of the line, when it hits to the far right of the meter, the line will snap.  The line can also be manually cut by pressing the \"A+B\" buttons together.\n\nThere are eight different lures to choose from (Pencil Bait, Torpedo, Jitterbug, Frog, Crankbait, Spoon, Furry Sinker & Plastic Worm) along with several different color variations to choose from and five fish to catch (Blue Gill, Rainbow Trout, Catfish, Northern Pike and the game's namesake, Bass).\n\nThere are also attributes the player can have, Technique and Strength, that can be upgraded by catching more bass and  progress can be kept through a password feature.",

      "description": "The SNES game based on the film <i>Jurassic Park</i> is an action title that combines top-down and first-person perspectives.\n\nPlaying as Dr. Alan Grant, the player's ultimate goal is to escape the Jurassic Park island. To reach that goal, several other tasks must be completed, including restoring power to the park and destroying a Velociraptor nest. \n\nThe large game world is seen from a top-down view and can be freely explored. Some areas are not accessible from the beginning, however. To enter them, keycards must be found or some special goal be completed, like rebooting the computer system and using it to open certain gates. Dr. Grant can defend himself against the many free-roaming dinosaurs with a variety of weapons, including an electroshock gun, a shotgun, rocket launcher, gas grenade launcher and bola gun. All weapons except the electro gun require ammo to work. A radar at the bottom of the screen helps in detecting approaching dinosaurs, but will only work once the park's motion detectors have been activated.\n\nUpon entering one of the park's buildings, the game view switches to a scrolling first person perspective, reminiscent of early first person shooters like Wolfenstein 3D. Just like outside, dinosaurs lurk in the corridors, and the same guns as in the overworld map can be used to destroy them. Many buildings consist of several floors, with elevators connecting them. Some rooms are pitch black and can only be entered when in possession of night vision goggles.\n\nThe game supports the SNES mouse for the first-person sections and the computer system interface.",

While the other versions are based on the Brian De Palma film starring Kevin Costner, this version is based on the 1993 remake of the original 1960's series that starred Robert Stack.\n\nThere are five different assignments (missions) to choose from, each with their own set time limit.  The first mission is set in the over the shoulder, third-person perspective in an alleyway using a shotgun to take down mobsters hiding in buildings.  The second mission is a 2D side-scroller set in a warehouse where the player must defend against gangsters and pick up counterfeiting plates scattered throughout a warehouse.  The third mission is a side-scrolling shooter, located on a dock, where the player uses a tommy gun to take out various bad guys scattered throughout the stage.  The fourth mission is a top-down shooter located at the top of a courthouse where the player must rescue hostages while defending against various bad guys.  The fifth and final mission is a first-person shooter located on the rooftops of Chicago against Al Capone himself. \n\nThe story is told between missions through old-time looking newspapers that report on the success or the failure of the player's mission.",

After they are attacked by an unknown group of enemies on both land and air, the player is tasked to root out these enemies and stop any further attacks on Coalition forces.\n\nMuch like its predecessor, the gameplay is a first-person tank simulation, using radar to scout out enemy tanks and using the main turret gun to disable and kill any opposing tanks, jeeps, APCs and various other heavy weapons including SCUD missiles.  If the player encounters and air resistance, they can mount their Phalanx machine gun to cut down enemy choppers.\n\nPlayers also have smoke screens that can temporarily make them unseen to any enemy forces, plus they can call in supply drops to replenish their armor and ammo as well as air support that can level any opposing force in their wake.",

Each of those 30 levels (grouped into six missions, with two levels being secret ones) is a simplified version of an original level. The end bosses for the missions are taken from both <i>Wolfenstein 3D</i> and its prequel, Spear of Destiny.\n\nOther changes from the original include new power-ups: an ammo box (taken from <i>Spear of Destiny</i>) and backpack that increases the maximum amount of ammo that can be carried.\n\nThe original's weapons (knife, pistol, machine gun, chaingun) all return, but there are also two completely new tools of destruction: a flame thrower and a rocket launcher.",

The game ends when all the opposing players ships are sunk. This mode contains four difficulty levels: Ensign, Lieutenant, Commander, and Admiral.\n\nSuper Battleship involves eight levels consisting of sixteen missions total. Missions include sinking enemy ships in a certain number of rounds, escorting ships to their destinations, defending cities from attack, and destroying enemy airfields. Gameplay consists of a turn-based moving of ships utilizing an overhead view. The player can then target any enemy units within the ship's range and attack. Attacking brings up an action sequence where both ships trade volleys of gunfire until one of them either sinks or retreats.\n\n",

      "description": "The player takes control of a starpilot with a mission to defend star bases from a fleet of invading alien warships. The game takes place from a cockpit perspective from one of four starfighters; the Stinger, Striker, Stalker,or Slasher. The game has 7 battle scenarios and a 4 scenario campaign mode. \n\nThe starfighter ships come equipped with a computer, engine, shield, weapons, and missiles which can be damaged from enemy combatants or space debris like asteroids. The ship also comes with a Long Range Scanner, which shows the locations of enemies on the map. The map itself is made up of 64 square sections. Finally, the ship also has a Hyperwave Reciever, that lets the player communicate with both the aliens and the player's base.\n\n",
