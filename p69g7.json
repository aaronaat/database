      "description": "<i>Wolfenstein 3D</i> is an episodic first-person shooter and a follow-up to the top-down infiltration game Castle Wolfenstein. The game puts the player in the boots of  B.J. Blazkowicz, an allied spy. There are six episodes: the first distributed complete as shareware; the second and the third available after registration; and the three final missions (which happen before the events of the first episode) available in the Nocturnal Missions pack. \n\nIn the first episode (Escape from Wolfenstein), B.J. is captured, but overpowers a guard with the help of a concealed knife and manages to get out of his cell. Throughout the next nine levels the player guides B.J. searching for an escape from Wolfenstein, guarded by Hans Grosse. After returning to Allied territory, B.J. is given the instructions to Operation: Eisenfaust, where he has to stop Dr. Schabbs and his army of mutant prototypes before they are released into the battlefields. The final mission (Die, F\u00fchrer, Die!) has a simple goal: infiltrate the bunker under the Reichstag, and terminate Hitler (in a robotic suit) himself.\n\nThe Nocturnal Missions are focused on the Nazi plans for chemical warfare, and start with Dark Secret, where B.J. hunts for lead researcher Dr. Otto Giftmacher. It's followed by Trail of the Madman, where the goal is capturing the war plans guarded by Gretel Grosse, and the final episode Confrontation, where B.J. meets General Fettgesicht, the planner for the chemical assault.\n\nEach episode has nine levels (eight regular and a final boss level), plus a secret level activated by an hidden switch somewhere in the eight first levels. Regular levels often feature a maze-like appearance or large areas with many enemies (the number of them on each area depends on the difficulty level), where the player must reach the exit elevator. To do so, he must kill the enemies (while it's possible to move behind the guards' backs and even there's a slight bonus in attacking them from behind, most enemies have to be dealt with by fire power), and depending on the level, activate \"push walls\" and/or get silver and golden keys to open certain doors.\n\nMany objects can be found in a level, from medikits, chicken meals, and even dog food (to restore health), ammo and treasures, which solely exist for points. There are four weapons (knife, pistol, machine gun and Gatling), all of them using the same bullets except the knife. The knife and the pistol are given at the start of the level, while the machine gun is either found (usually in secret areas) or picked up from SS troopers, and the Gatling is always dropped somewhere in the level. There are five kinds of enemies (excluding bosses) - Dogs (fast, but more a nuisance than life-threatening), Army Soldiers (dressed in regular brown outfit, not very powerful but usually found in large groups), Officers (dressed in white, armed with a very accurate pistol and tough to kill), SS Troopers (blue attire, armed with a machine gun and tough to kill), and Mutants (the rarest and toughest of regular enemies, pale-skinned troopers with green clothes and a machine gun stuck in their chest).\n\nThe player character has a number of lives; once he loses the last life, the game ends. To win extra lives, the player has to either find the 1-up item in the level or get 20,000 points (by killing enemies and capturing treasures or completing a level below the 'par' time while killing all enemies, finding all secrets by pushing walls, and collecting all treasure points).",

      "description": "Commonly considered the earliest progenitor of first-person shooters (FPS), <i>Battlezone</i> is a 3D tank game initially released in the arcades, and later converted officially to many systems. Earth has been invaded, and you and your tank lead the defensive effort. You drive around the battlefield from a first-person view, targeting and firing at tanks, planes and UFOs. You have a radar to help you see where the enemies are in direction and distance. Objects can be used as strategic cover. Controls simulate the tracks of a tank realistically, so the direction and speed settings are varied - combining forward right and backward left movements (as you can on keyboard versions) sees you change direction more quickly.",

      "description": "Following the events of the original game, the Pfhor aliens have been defeated and the A.I. known as Durandral has been freed from it's containment. 17 years have passed and Durandral has assembled his own army from the colonists of Tau Ceti, including the Security Officer. Traveling across the galaxy, Durandral finds the home world of the S'pht, a Pfhor slave race, who Durandal liberates and who now worship Durandral as their Messiah. Durandal is searching for the location of a legendary lost tribe of S'pht who may hold the key to his mad quest for... well, whatever he's madly questing for. Unfortunately, the Pfhor dislike Durandral's presence and begin attacking his army. \n\n<i>Marathon 2: Durandal</i> is the sequel to the first Marathon. Although the engine is similar to Doom in most respects (2.5D maps, bitmap sprites instead of polygons, etc.), <i>Marathon 2</i> distinguishes itself with such features such as: a rudimentary inventory system, ambient sound, multiple fire modes for each weapon, allies who aid the player, enemies belonging to different factions which will attack each other, a more developed plot (gradually narrated to the player at various computer terminals scattered throughout the levels (much like System Shock's e-mail transmissions)).\n\nThe game's engine has gained a number of improvements over the original Marathon.  It now displays in a much larger portion of the screen, supports maps with four times the complexity and adds support for liquids and swimming.  All liquids use oxygen when the player is submerged and some also do damage.  Many levels have mechanisms allowing  areas to be flooded or drained, changing the depth of the liquid.\n\nThe other major new feature is a bunch of new multiplayer modes.  The entire single-player portion can be played cooperatively with up to eight players and the game adjusts weapon and monster placement accordingly.  In addition to \"Every Man for Himself\" mode (essentially deathmatch), it now includes \"Kill of the Hill\" where the object is to occupy a designated spot on the map more than anyone else, and \"Kill the Guy with the Ball\" where the object is to hold a skull the longest, the player holding it being unable to fire weapons.",

Through their highly trained operatives and special devices (gadgets), Carrington keeps an eye on terrorists, world powers, and strange happenings. The speed in which the dataDyne corporation has established itself through the development of new technologies is starting to worry the institute. So when Carrington receives a message from Dr. Caroll, a scientist wishing to escape dataDyne, they send their best agent, Joanna, to infiltrate the company headquarters.\n\n<i>Perfect Dark</i> is a 3D first-person shooter similar to Rare's earlier GoldenEye 007, though with more of an emphasis on stealth. Joanna can pick up and use a variety of firearms, including shotguns, submachine guns, sniper rifles, various explosives, and others.  In addition she carries quite a few spy gadgets such as IR scanners, night vision, probes, and a deadly laptop. Most weapons have secondary fire modes and reloading them is displayed in an on-screen animation. \n\nShields are scattered through the stages and can be picked up for additional protection. There are no health-restoring items and Joanna cannot jump. Like <i>GoldenEye 007</i>, the game has three difficulty levels, with the higher ones featuring more accurate enemies, less ammo, and more objectives for the player to complete within each mission. Cutscenes with voice acting advance the story between missions.\n\nThe game also features a training mode set in the Carrington Institute. Completing the firing range challenge there unlocks the classic weapons from <i>GoldenEye 007</i>.  In addition, the campaign can be played in a co-operative mode for two human players or one human player and up to three computer-controlled teammates (in split-screen mode), as well as in a \"Counter Operative\" mode, where one of the players takes control of an enemy and tries to stop Joanna from fulfilling her mission. \n\nMultiplayer includes a variety of modes. Among those are the traditional deathmatch as well as the objective-based Capture the Flag and King of the Hill modes. Other scenarios and objectives include surviving as long as possible while carrying a briefcase, hacking computer systems with randomly placed data uplinks, and hunting down a single player as a team. Stages, teams, and weapon placement can be customized by players.\n\nThe Xbox 360 port has redone graphics to support a 1080p full HD resolution at 60 frames per second. It also incorporates full multiplayer support over Xbox LIVE.",

      "description": "Humanity is the midst of a long war against an alien alliance called the Covenant who have been wiping out colony after colony. You hero is Master Chief, who is given no name beyond his rank in the game itself. He is stationed on the Pillar of Autumn, a ship which, per protocol make a jump in a random direction to retreat to avoid revealing the location of Earth. They find themselves at the titular Halo, a planet-sized ring of mysterious origin and function with the Covenant on their heels.  Master Chief must repel the Covenant assault and discover the secrets of Halo with the assistance of the female AI Cortana who lives in his suit and gives missions.\n\n<i>Halo: Combat Evolved</i> is a sci-fi first-person shooter with considerable driving elements. Features include friendly NPCs who fight alongside the Chief, squad-based AI where enemies groups work together to flank you under the direction of a leader unit and can be demoralized by his death. They also use cover, set ambushes, etc.\n\nOnly two weapons may be carried at a time: one active and one on back-up.  There are five human weapons and three Covenant with distinct art styles for the two groups. Human weapons look basically like real guns and fire projectiles. Covenant are sleek and purple and fire energy. For the most part, weapons are not just left around the environment and must be procured from fallen enemies though there are supply points.\n\nYour life is armor and health as in most games of the genre, however, rather than armor being an item than is picked up, it is a force field which quickly recharges itself after several seconds without taking damage, which emphasizes finding cover.\n\nOne of most significant features is vehicles. You can drive a variety of vehicles in both single player and multiplayer, some of which have additional seats for passengers or gunners which can be used by AI characters. Vehicles also come in distinct human and Covenant varieties with their design philosophies.  Human vehicles roll around the ground on wheels and covenant vehicles hover or fly.\n\n<i>Halo</i> also has a significant multiplayer component with basic deathmatch (called slayer here), capture the flag with the unusual addition that the flag takes your weapon spot while you are holding it, so shooting your way in and out of the base on your own is not an option, territories, and some options unique to the game, such as oddball, where you must hold onto a skull for the longest time, race where you score points by getting to checkpoints and juggernaut, where one super-powered player must get points by killing the others and the other players try to kill him to steal his powers. There is also a game editor which allows you to set custom rules for all the basic game types. All the playable weapons and vehicles from the campaign mode are available in the multiplayer maps with the ability for members of the same team to share the game's distinctive Warthog vehicle, which is essentially a small truck with a mounted gun on the back.",

      "description": "As the pilot of an interstellar starship, your mission is to destroy all enemy spacecraft on the galactic chart and prevent them from destroying your starbases. There are three different types of fighters roaming throughout the galaxy; cruisers, fighters, and basestars. With the help of your galactic map, you can find the sectors of the galaxy where these fighters are located and then warp there to destroy them. When all of the fighters in a sector are destroyed, you can warp to a new location for the next battle. Be sure to keep an eye on your starship's energy level; warping to new locations, being hit by enemy fire, or colliding with an asteroid will drain your energy. If you completely run out of energy, your starship will be destroyed, however you can warp back to a starbase to refuel at any time. Returning to a starbase will also repair other types of damage your starship can receive, such as faulty engines, loss of your shields, and faulty photon torpedoes. When all of the enemy ships have been destroyed, you win the game and receive a rank.\n",

Points are scored by passing checkpoints located throughout the track. If your car crashes into the side of the road, oncoming cars, or any other obstacles, you will lose all of your speed and a lot of time! The game ends when the 90 second time limit is up. The four tracks you can choose from are beginner, pro, expert, and random (this track is different every time and can not be memorized like the other three). Several game options are included which allows you to select whether or not other cars will honk before entering the screen, and choose between a 90 second or infinite amount of time for a game.",

      "description": "<i>Call of Duty</i> is a first-person shooter set during World War II and the first title in a long-running series. It is also the first game by development studio Infinity Ward and in some ways builds upon Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, a similar title a part of the team had been working on at 2015, Inc. before forming a new company.\n\nPlayers experience the battle in Europe during World War II in different campaigns divided further into missions. Unlike <i>MoH: AA</i> these are not only presented from the view of an American soldier, there is a British and a Soviet campaign as well, each focusing on different parts of the battle. In total there are 24 interconnected missions to play to get to Berlin. In each campaign a different perspective is offered, starting as an American Paratrooper during D-Day, progressing to assume the role as an English Special Forces commando, and finally as a Russian tank commander. Some missions are played in solitary fashion, but in most of them the player is part of a larger group with computer-controlled team mates.\n\nMost of the combat is infantry-based, but some is also set between vehicles or tanks. Multiplayer modes include death match, team death match, behind enemy lines (where the allies are outnumbered) and two objective-based modes: retrieval, and search and destroy.\n\nThe later-released console version <i>Call of Duty Classic</i> is a reworking of the original game with enhanced graphics.",

Your goal is to earn as many points as possible by shooting the various enemies and space debris. You have a time limit of 2 minutes 16 seconds in the one player versions. In the two player version the time limit is 4 minutes 32 seconds; for half of this time one player will be the star ship commander, and the other will control a space module and needs to dodge the star ships fire. The roles will be reversed for the second half of the time limit.\n\n<li><b>Warp Drive</b></li>These game variations are also played from a first person point of view. Your goal here is to travel as much distance as possible while avoiding the oncoming asteroids.\n\n<li><b>Lunar Lander</b></li>These game variations are played from a third person point of view. You need to pilot your star ship and successfully land on the constantly moving moon. One point is earned for each successful landing, and asteroids and other debris may get in your way and will deduct points if you crash. In the two player versions, one player controls the star ship and the other player controls the moon.\n</ul>\n\nEach of these games feature several variations which control the game speed and level of difficulty.",

The situation is gradually getting worse, as the rate of DomZ kidnapings increase. The Alpha Section forces, who are in charge of protecting citizens, seem to be completely ineffective, not even fighting the DomZ. In the midst of this situation, the secretive organization IRIS alleges that the Alpha Section is involved in a massive government conspiracy, and seeks to expose the truth through journalism.\n\nThe player controls a young reporter and photographer named Jade with her companions Pey'j and Double H. After experiencing first-hand a DomZ attack, she is contacted by IRIS, who recruit her as an action reporter. Jade is now tasked with infiltrating the Alpha Section, exposing the government conspiracy, and ultimately finding the truth for herself.\n\n<i>Beyond Good & Evil</i> is an action game with diverse gameplay. Much of the game is based on stealth and puzzles, but there are sequences of racing, shooting, combat, and platform action. Jade fights with her staff and also uses various abilities to execute long-ranged attacks and solve puzzles. Many of the puzzles require switching between the characters and using their special abilities; often it is necessary to coordinate the actions of two characters to achieve precise co-operation that leads to a puzzle's solution. Beside hostile areas with puzzles and enemies, there is also a city and other friendly areas to explore, where various items and gadgets can (and sometimes must) be bought. There are several mini-games and even an online ranking system (used by entering codes online after they are assigned in-game when the game is saved). ",

The more cars you take out, damage you inflict, the more events and cars you can unlock. Burnout 3 also has a \"crash\" mode which puts your vehicle at a variety of traffic junctions jam-packed with moving vehicles and pickups to see just how much monetary damage you can inflict.\r\n\r\nBurnout 3: Takedown continues the racing series with more cars, more tracks, a more detailed crash engine, and a multitude of new gameplay modes for single players, multiple players on one system, and online play.\r\n\r\nSome features include:\r\n\r\nCrash Mode: In addition to this gameplay element introduced in Burnout 2, Pick-ups have been added. They are scattered throughout the intersections. Some pick-ups will halve, double or quadruple your score, cause massive explosions to cause even more damage, or increase your damage with monetary bonuses.\r\n\r\nSophisticated crash technology allows for high-speed crashes with extreme detail.  Use your vehicle as a weapon and takedown rivals, using the new Aftertouch feature to control your vehicle after the moment of impact.\r\n\r\n9 Race Modes including Single Race, Tournament, Lap Eliminator, Burning Lap and Road Rage.\r\n\r\nMultiplayer Modes include Quick Line, Battle Race, Road Rage, and Party Crash, where 2-16 players participate in a pass-the-controller match-up.\r\n\r\n7 Online Modes allow you to race online with up to 6 players.

Gameplay is based on the successful standards set by Battlefield 1942, but combat in Battlefront is even more massive and heated, vehicles are more predominant and the familiar starships are also included.\r\n\r\n There are three different game modes to play: Historical Campaign (featuring a series of \"historical\" battles from the Star Wars mythos), Conquest (in which players vie for dominance of individual planets) and, of course, Instant Action. The game puts two pairs of factions at war: Republic vs Separatists and Rebel Alliance vs Galactic Empire. Each faction has four standard unit types (soldier, heavy weapons trooper, scout and pilot) plus a fifth, special unit which differs radically for each side. Famous Jedi and Sith are included as NPCs only in selected battles. Finally, the game offers almost all of the vehicles seen in the movies for players to fly, drive or hover and prevail.",

      "description": "<i>RocketBowl</i> is a bowling game with a futuristic twist. It's the 1958 Kalamazoo World's Fair, and it's premiere for the new sport Rocket Bowling. Like in real bowling your objective is to knock down all the pins. But <i>RocketBowl</i> is different in many ways. It's played in a big arena that almost looks like a mini golf courses and it has both hills and curves and different obstacles. You can roll the ball into another frame and there score, making it possible to take out pins in two frames at a shot. Balls are not quite normal either, in <i>RocketBowl</i> the balls are equipped with jets and you have several different balls that you can buy when you have earned enough money. You earn money when you win tournaments or if you hit special dollar bins. The game contains 7 courses and 20 bowling balls. ",

      "description": "Brave is a young native American boy who lives in the forest. As he wants to become a warrior, the elderly shaman Grey Bear prepares an adventure and hides carvings that will grant him new skills. During the search, however, the village is brutally attacked by the demonic creature Wendigo. Brave is the only one who can defeat it, but in order to do that, he has to track the path of the mysterious shaman Spirit Dancer, discover his past, and find the means to defeat the evil force.\r\n\r\nBrave is a 3D third-person platformer with puzzles. Set in worlds with different themes (ice world, volcanic world, wastelands, forest...), Brave can roam freely, but certain parts are only opened up after solving quests. The boy can jump, duck, climb, and do basic attack moves. While observing, for certain actions, and when using ranged weapons, a first-person view is available as well. During the adventure, Brave acquires new abilities, which allow him to track creatures by smell or their tracks, mimic animals' sounds to lure or distract them, summon creatures, or invoke shaman powers to become an animal (an eagle, a bear, a rabbit and even a skunk). Health is acquired by killing animals or destroying vegetation. Brave can also collect up to five eagle feathers, which allow him to stock up on shaman power that provides superior strength for a short time.\r\n\r\nThe exploration gameplay has been mixed with action sequences, where you canoe down river rapids, or ride on a buffalo or an eagle while fighting. There is a strong emphasis on movement and platform-jumping, and there is an adjustable difficulty level, reflected in the amount of hints Grey Bear provides through a \"mobile stone\". Next to the abilities, there are different weapons to be found, such as spears, tomahawks and bows. Additionally, Brave can search for secret totems that open up concept art in the menu.",

      "description": "A cockpit view space shooter very similar to Star Raiders but not requiring a keypad. In your starship, you must warp to sectors of space containing enemy starships. Here you will engage and destroy them before they can surround and destroy your starbases.   In a starbase sector, use your joystick to guide your reticle to the starbase when it is near you for repair and/or refueling. In a fight, you can take damage. If you see a L, it meas your lasers are out of commission. This mean you cannot fire (this is not good in a fight!). If you see a W, it means your warp drive is damaged. You will use twice as much fuel when warping. If you see an S, it means your shields are out. If you are hit again with no shields, you will be destroyed. If you see an R, it means your radar is damaged. You will not be able to see the enemies on the starmap until you get the radar fixed. All your starbases will still show with damaged radar except any that have been destroyed. When warping, if the screen at the bottom is green, you are headed to an empty sector. If it is red, you are headed to a sector with enemies in it. If it is blue, you are headed to a sector with a starbase in it. The game ends when either all the enemies are destroyed or you are destroyed. Your final score is determined by your base score plus 100 points per enemy destroyed minus 500 points per starbase destroyed minus 100 points per each time you docked at a starbase minus 1 point per stardate.",

      "description": "January 2009. On a cold, snowy night in New York City, an ordinary citizen named Lucas Kane, under the control of an unknown force, unwillingly murders a complete stranger in a diner. Once he comes to senses, Lucas realizes he must escape while leaving as little evidence as possible behind. Barely managing to accomplish that, Lucas contacts his brother and tries to understand what has caused him to commit the crime, recalling the events of his own past in the process. Meanwhile, two police detectives investigating the murder, Carla Valenti and Tyler Miles, are determined to find the perpetrator, at the same time trying to deal with the personal problems of their lives.\n\n<i>Indigo Prophecy</i> (<i>Fahrenheit</i> in Europe) is a psychological thriller in which the player is able to control different characters on both sides of a murder - the killer and those who are trying to find him. The game's core gameplay style is adventure. The three protagonists explore various locations, talk to other characters, and interact with the environment in order to advance. However, the game is heavy on various action-oriented sequences, from tasks that must be completed within a limited amount of time to quick time events, which require the player to press the correct button during a scene.\n\nThe game emphasizes realism in the player's interaction with the environment. For example, picking up a rag and cleaning the floor requires the player to  move the mouse or the analog stick back and forth, imitating the actual movements of the object. Dialogue with character often imposes time limits on the player; failure to choose the optimal response in time will prompt the game to choose another, not always the optimal one. The player's choice will sometimes influence the subsequent events and the outcome of the entire story, eventually leading it to one of the three possible endings.\n\nCinematic treatment is evident in the game's handling of action-based gameplay and cutscenes, which are often seamlessly integrated into each other. An example of this is the split-screen technique, which is often used during the game's most dramatic moments: while the player is trying to complete the required action in time on one screen, another one displays what is happening around the controlled character.",

      "description": "The fourth Burnout racing game puts you once again in the eye of traffic storms, where you do not only rush to be the fastest, but brutally, yet stylishly, take down your opponents. This is emphasized by <i>impact time</i>, which shows crashes in all their slowed-down glory, and the boost you receive after a successful wrecking. Reckless driving bumps your Revenge rank, unlocking new events. This can also be achieved by medal placings that grant new vehicles.\n\nCollectible signature takedowns, crashbreakers (detonate your vehicle, now also in some regular races) and aftertouch for precise havoc remain, but one of the major changes is the ability to check traffic. Non-racing vehicles are no longer a nuisance with the sole purpose of slowing you down. They can now be actively used to obstruct traffic or send them into your foes. The Road Rage mode (take down a set number of rivals within a time limit) and Crash mode make a return, but Traffic Attack is new - race against the clock and level the traffic at the same time. Other modes include regular races, grand prix races, Burning Lap (high-speed time attack), Eliminator (last one after each round is out) and a normal time attack mode.\n\nIn the Crash mode, the multipliers and bonuses have been removed, and you cannot drive at full speed towards a crossroads. You have to time your start to receive a proper boost and then it is only about steering, crashbreakers and aftertouch. There are many new tracks and cars, a soundtrack with lots of famous artists, and a new world tour in different countries.\n\nOnline multiplayer is available for up to six players. New off-line additions are the split-screen Traffic Attack and a hot-seat Crash Tour for up to six players, next to the familiar Road Rage, Crash Party and Crash Battle modes.",

      "description": "Quake 4 is the true sequel to Quake II, continuing the Strogg vs. Humans storyline from the point where Quake II ended. The Strogg is an alien cyborg race which, much like the Star Trek Borg race from which they seem to be partly inspired, wander the galaxy conquering planets and wiping civilizations. Their sole purpose is to collect organic body parts with which to swell their ranks. After a prolonged war, the united armed forces of Earth decided to launch a desperate counter attack on the home planet of the invaders, Stroggos. By some twist of fate a sole marine was able to disable the Strogg main planetary defense (aka The Big Gun) and kill Makron, their leader. That was the end of Quake II. The second wave of attack is meant to land on Stroggos and take advantage of the brief disorder, ending the threat of the Strogg forever. Of course it will not be that easy...\r\n\r\nThis time the lone soldier theme (of Quake I, II and the Doom series) is replaced by a war. Not as large scale as a military FPS or even Halo, but close enough. There are squad mates, some of which are important to protect, some vehicles (a hovertank and a mech) and frequently changing objectives to achieve. The arsenal contains elements from all Quake games (nailgun, rail gun, lightning gun) and the classic BFG has been replaced by the Dark Matter Gun. Weapons can be improved later in the game, making them much more effective. The game uses a somewhat improved version of the Doom 3 engine to good effect. Multiplayer options are rather limited, offering only the standard Deathmatch modes and CTF.\r\n\r\nQuake 4 was developed by Raven under the guidance of id Software.",

Demons are replaced by cloned soldiers and the element of horror revolves around an image of a spectral girl always appearing when least expected for a few fleeting moments.\n\nThe player sets out as a member of a specialized strike force dealing with unknown threats. Initially, the player starts with mundane weapons, which are well presented, and progress gradually towards more sci-fi ones as the danger increases. The player can also call upon a <i>bullet-time</i> ability which slows down time around the player and is realised with impressive visual and aural effects by the game engine.\n\nThe game takes place in a certain multi-billion aerospace installation which has been hijacked by an elite team of cloned soldiers gone rogue and an unknown supernatural force (which is likely controlling or affecting them in some way). Both threats must be identified and countered.",

The player must gain notoriety by racing in the streets and attracting the attention of the cops in order to ascend in the Black List of illegal racers. In the end he must face no.1, Razor who tricked him out of his own car and used it to get to the top.\n\nMany racing modes are carried on from NFSU2 with the addition of \"Milestones\", special events where the driver must evade capture and/or disable police cars by bringing down Pursuit Breakers, specially marked buildings such as gas stations and water towers. For each one of the 15 Blacklisted opponents, the player must win a specific number of events from each of the two main types and gain enough notoriety in the process. The player can invest bet money to buy new cars or improve his existing one's looks and performance so that he remains competitive.\n\nIn <i>Most Wanted</i>, Josie Maran replaces Brooke Burke as the racer girl. The plot is furthered through use of FMV video with live actors and digital sets, which has been heavily enhanced so that it looks quite real.",

      "description": "<i>Perfect Dark Zero</i> is a prequel to the Nintendo 64 game Perfect Dark, set years before the original game. Joanna Dark is not yet the perfect agent, so it's up to the player to get her there. Like the original, \"Zero\" is also a first person shooter with plenty of sci-fi gadgets and weaponry - some familiar, some new.\n\nWorking as a bounty hunter, she and her father Jack accidentally step on toes of shadowy corporations and reveal a global conspiracy. Changing their destinies forever, Joanna and Jack find themselves fighting for the future of the entire planet.\n\nYou can carry up to four different weapons, but bigger guns take more inventory space, meaning you can pack several pistols but only one machine gun at a time. Carrying bigger weapons also affect your running speed. There is no jump button, but the game features smart tactical options depending the scene; from a touch of a button you can take cover behind obstacles, perform athletic rolls, ... You can even disarm your opponents by grabbing their guns out of their hands.\n\nIn addition to espionage thriller single player game, there are also many multiplayer options, including four-player split-screen and cooperative play. Xbox Live adds few new ideas and twists to familiar game modes, like fully scalable environments. There is also built-in ranking system via Live.",

      "description": "In <i>Condemned: Criminal Origins</i> players take on the role of agent Ethan Thomas, a member of the FBI's Serial Crimes Unit (SCU). He is part of an investigation looking for a serial killer known as The Match Maker, who kills people and then arranges their corpse with a department store mannequin. During the search Thomas comes across another serial killer who seems to be very interested in Thomas and his cases. It is up to you to determine who the true serial killer is, and who is behind it.\n\nThe game is played from a first-person perspective with a variety of weapons to attack your enemies. Focusing on melee combat Thomas can grab items directly from the environment, such as signs, pipes, 2x4's, concrete, rails, planks of wood, even desktops and desk drawers. There is also a supply of firearms, such as the standard pistol and shotgun, but all of those only have a limited amount of ammo.\n\nThe hunt takes Thomas across several different areas, from an abandoned office building to a subway station to an elementary school to an apple farm on the outskirts of town, battling all kinds of deranged people along the way. Combat is brutal and Thomas is able to perform a number of graphic finishing moves. The game is largely set in dark and narrow environment, with many horror elements. Lighting is scarce and Thomas has to use his flashlight at all time to light the environment. Enemies are also able to pull fuses to turn off lights and use the new darkness to their advantage. Movement is generally slow, but Thomas is able to sprint for a short moment. Health is replenished through kits scattered around. Enemies engage using the same weapons and they are also able to grab Thomas, which requires moving around frantically until they let go, with a dark haze over the screen visualizing the effects of strangulation. The screen also often turns grainy when Thomas has strange visions related to the serial killers.\n\nNext to the combat there are also many moments where Thomas has to investigate the scenes, using several different types of forensic tools to find clues and help further the story. Use the UV light to find traces of blood, get a blood sample using the sample guy, use your laser light to find evidence that may be hidden. You also have a scanner to scan certain items, and a digital camera for any photographs which need to be taken. Most of the importation is processed at the bureau and Thomas keeps in touch with them through his phone.",

World Xplorer sees you going through a hexagonal based \"universe\" from easy to difficult races. Nitro is gained by drifting and jumping through the races and allows you to build up three nitro boost cells to use one at a time or one after the other for a bigger boost.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in the series, Ridge Racer goes online with Online Battle Mode allowing up to 14 players to drift against each other. Also, if you don't want to race you can watch other players racing on Spectator mode. Global Time Attack mode challenges you to get the best times and upload them to the scoreboards, to see if you are best in the world or not.",

There are primary and secondary objectives, such as reaching a rendezvous point and gathering intel.\n\n<i>Black</i> is a traditional first-person shooter with variety of weapons and interactive scenery - interactive meaning destructible in this case.  Enemy soldiers can be killed by destroying a nearby fuel tank for example, and weak shelter, like a wooden fence, can be shot to pieces in order to expose the enemy.\n\nThe game can be played in four difficulty levels: easy, normal, hard, and black ops.  In easy mode, only the primary objective is required.  In normal and hard modes, some of the secondary objectives are required.  In black ops mode - unlocked after completing the game on hard - all objectives must be reached.  New weapons are also unlocked after finishing a level.",

      "description": "A lowly prisoner has been cast into the depths of the dungeon in the Imperial capital of the province Cyrodiil. The fate of this prisoner suddenly changed when the Emperor Uriel Septim descended into the prison with his guards, fleeing from unknown assassins who have already slaughtered his children. But even an emperor cannot escape his destiny. Before the last assassin delivered the lethal strike, the old emperor entrusted the prisoner with the Amulet of Kings and asked him to find his illegitimate son, the last of the Septim bloodline. The Septims and the Amulet are the last barrier between the continent Tamriel and the dark dimension of Oblivion, and the delicate balance is threatened by the Daedra Prince of Destruction, Mehrunes Dagon, the prisoner being Tamriel's only hope.\n\n<i>Oblivion</i> is the fourth title in Bethesda's <i>Elder Scrolls</i> series. The game sticks to the style of its predecessors featuring action-based combat, first-person and third-person views, and vast free-roaming environments. The player's chosen race and class determine the abilities the protagonist has in the beginning. The game allows the player to develop multiple types of characters without being limited to a specific role. \n\nThe advancement system, as was the case in previous games, is based on skill usage. When the player repeatedly use one of the skills, it improves. NPCs offer training (for a price) to help in advancing to the next stage. In time the protagonist can become an Apprentice, Journeyman, Expert and Master and gain certain bonuses for the skill. The skills of the foes are \"levelled\" to be approximately equal to or slightly above those of the main character.\n\nThere are numerous side quests which help the hero advance his or her abilities as well as gain fame. The player is free to roam the world without a particular goal, exploring towns, forts, caves, mines, and old temple ruins. Visiting shrines scattered around Tamriel grants the protagonist specialized skills, some permanent and some temporary.\n\nWeapons and armor wear out with use and need to be repaired either with the help of special non-playable characters or by using an appropriately trained Armorer skill. Enhanced items (weapons, armor, clothing, rings, amulets) abound in the game for protection, resistance, reflection and special activities like walking on water, exploring underwater, becoming invisible or lightening the load. It is possible to open the gates to the Oblivion realm to grab their sigil stones, which can be used to make enhanced items. Higher-level mages can create their own spells, and enchant weapons, armor and clothing using filled soul gems in addition to sigil stones.\n\nAs opposed to Morrowind, mana points gradually regenerate over time, without the need to rest to replenish them. Active blocking has been added to melee combat. The game features full voice acting for all the NPCs. Dialogues typically contain less topics than in <i>Morrowind</i>, but more responses unique to different characters. In addition, the so-called \"radiant AI\" system makes characters follow their own schedules, engage in various activities or talk to each other regardless of the player's input. The game features fast traveling, allowing the player to instantly visit Cyrodiil's major cities or previously explored areas.",

Fresh from the flight-academy he learns from an good friend of his father, that his mysterious death was caused by sabotage. As a last gift from his father, he gets the ownership of the one-of-a-kind ship Darkstar One and now makes his way to find out the truth behind his fathers death.\n\nDarkstar is a mix of Freelancer and Wing Commander: Privateer as you can fly your ship either with a mouse or a joystick. \n\nAs you solve the riddle you can visit 330 star-systems in which you can trade goods from other systems, take contracts like blasting a pirate gang out of the sky or try to be a pirate yourself. Every action influences the reputation with at least one faction and the game gives you total freedom in what you want to do or what career you want to pursue.\n\nIt is also possible to search for artifacts. As opposed to other games of this type, you don't buy a bigger ship. Through the whole game you only fly the Darkstar One. You upgrade the ship through artifacts you found in asteroids. If you have enough artifacts for an upgrade, you can boost the basic attributes of the ship. This enables you to install more and bigger weapons or goodies like a shield-booster.",

This time he goes on a trip around America, undertaking missions in major cities such as Las Vegas, New Orleans, Los Angeles and other exotic locations. This time, he better watch his back, as his long-time employer, the International Contract Agency, is threatened by a mysterious rival. \n\nGameplay in <i>Hitman: Blood Money</i> is generally similar to the previous installments. Once again, your job will be to complete several assassination missions. You can sneak around in disguise to avoid the suspicious guards, or you can instead open fire on everyone you see. When you complete your mission, you're given a rating - from \"Mass Murderer\" up to the coveted \"Silent Assassin\". \n\n<i>Blood Money</i> introduces a lot of new features, however. A new notoriety system will track every single one of your moves, which in turn will demand utmost calculation in order to successfully accomplish your objectives. For those of you who are tired of a direct approach, you will be given the opportunity to stage accidents and should you be suspected, bribes and \"other\" accidents will always be at hand. <i>Blood Money</i> also gives the player the opportunity to customize weapons.

      "description": "When Tommy, a garage mechanic, defends his girlfriend in a bar fight in a Native American reservation in Oklahoma, the entire bar, along with everyone inside, is sucked into a shuttlecraft. They are transported into The Sphere, an enormous, organic alien ship. Tommy is set free by one of the denizens and his task is to save his girlfriend Jen and grandfather Enisi, and find out what the meaning of The Sphere is.\n\nThis 3D-shooter, based on a modified version of the Doom 3 engine, takes place entirely inside the gigantic ship. As a combination of organic and cybernetic structures, gravity is defied: with the proper grids activated, you can walk on walls and ceilings. There are also multiple dimensions inside the ship you can cross using portals. During his quest, Tommy struggles with his Native American lineage. The ghost-like hawk Talon is always on your side and you sometimes cross over to another land to get help from your grandfather. Tommy can also shift to Spirit Walk, an alternate dimension in the game to get past obstacles and solve puzzles. When you die, you are also transported to another realm where you have to shoot lost souls with your spirit bow before being sent back. Your new health and spirit status will be based on your performance there.\n\nThe weapons Tommy uses are usually organic, with secondary fire functions. The arsenal includes a wrench, a rifle, crawlers, an acid sprayer, an auto cannon, a leech gun (chargeable with fire, ice, red orbs or lightning), a rocket launcher and the spirit bow. Certain parts of the game require you to explore large areas in a flying pod. You can use it to engage enemies or use the tractor beam to move objects. Navigation, often with a distinct lack of direction, is reminiscent of Descent then. Puzzles usually require you to decipher codes, activate switches and find entrances.\n\nThe game supports OpenAL and EAX HD surround sound, and multiplayer games for up to eight players in duel or team deathmatch. Although the game is developed by Human Head Studios, it is produced and was originally designed by 3D Realms.",

With 8 difficulty settings there is a lot of the game to master as you must start to keep an eye on your fuel, torpedoes, radar, and enemy while avoiding depth charges as the difficulty rises.  You can fire up to two torpedoes at a time. While enemy shows go by your periscope sink as many as you can.  The periscope can turn 360 degrees and look off into the horizon or close to your sub.  Some ships move slower than others, and one of the ships moves so fast that the only way to hit it is by tracking it by radar instead of visually.",

In the main scenario mode, you select one of the missions in the world to defend or take out targets, or destroy enemies, with primary and secondary objectives. After an introduction outlining the scenario, you take off with a limited amount of ammo, and sometimes wingmen who can be commanded to support your strategies.\n\nYou will be attacked in the air and from the ground, and planes have a realistic damage model where specific parts such as the engine or the wings can be damaged. Completing tasks advances the story and unlocks new planes. After each mission, you are graded based on your performance. Your actions can be stored on the flight data recorder and replayed afterwards.\n\nIn the Challenge mode, you can design your own scenarios to test tactics and fly specific planes. The online multiplayer mode supports up to eight players in both co-operative and head-to-head missions. You gain ranks for making kills.",

      "description": "Billy Candle fled the town of Hope when he was young. Beaten by his dad on a daily basis, he looked for a way out and was drawn to the Call of Juarez - a myth about a great treasure buried near the city border of Juarez. His search yields no result and he returns, disappointed, to his birth village to visit his mother. One of the other villagers is Billy's uncle Ray McCall, once a fearsome gunslinger. Twenty years earlier, he decided to shed no more blood and take up the bible instead, becoming a reverend in Hope. When Billy secretly meets with his old friend Suzy, he is chased down the village and becomes an unlucky witness of the murder on his mother and father. He is spotted at the scene near their corpses while the farm is on fire and becomes the prime suspect. Reverend McCall swears vengeance and takes up his guns, disturbing the quiet village life. Fugitive Billy and hunter Ray become the two protagonists of <i>Call of Juarez</i>, a first-person Wild West shooter.\n\nPlayers alternately take the role of the Billy or Ray. Their missions are set in the same locations, they sometimes briefly meet and their actions influence each other, but the paths are entirely different. Both characters can dual-wield revolvers or carry around a shotgun, a winchester or a rifle with scope, but Ray also holds a bible he can cite from to stun enemies, uses his fists, and he can kick and wear a protective vest. Billy on the other hand is younger and more athletic. He can climb rocks, shoots with a bow and uses a whip to scare off animals and swing from branches. Both characters have access to a time-limited concentration mode. Similar to the \"bullet time\" made famous by Max Payne, the game slows down and the cross-hairs of the weapons slowly move from the side of the screen to the middle. Players can use this technique to take out multiple enemies at once.\n\nThe playing style is also different. Ray usually moves around all guns blazing, while Billy is a fugitive, forcing him to sneak around and hide in shadows. Enemies respond to movement, sound and even flashes of lighting illuminating areas. The story takes the characters through villages, mines, but also train robberies, chase sequences on horses and one-on-one duels based on reflexes. Compared to its contemporaries, <i>Call of Juarez</i> is more similar to Dead Man's Hand with the linear mission structure, in contrast with GUN's large amount of freedom and the open environment.\n\nMost objects can be picked up and moved around to the player's advantage - mainly as cover, but also for building structures, opening drawers, pushing carts and throwing oil lamps followed by a shot to set an area aflame. A compass with a red dot always points to the next checkpoint. Weapons need to be reloaded regularly, automatically or manually, and health is replenished through drinks. Players collect ammo from crates or dead enemies and can choose to exchange weapons.\n\nThe multiplayer mode features online play against up to 31 other people in different modes. From deathmatch and team deathmatch to modes like \"gold-fever\" in which players pick up as much gold as they can find on the map. The Xbox 360 version adds achievements, three bonus missions when you finish the game and ten duel challenges.",

      "description": "In Sam Fisher's first next generation adventure, the splinter cell has a tragedy befall him.  Shortly thereafter, Sam's life collapses around him.  He becomes more distant from Third Echelon.  In fact, he even goes so far as to get himself arrested.\n\nBut it's all part of the plan.  Sam Fisher is now a double agent, working for both the NSA and a terrorist organization known as the JBA, or John Brown's Army.  Sam is for the most part a good guy still.  But will that remain?  Will Sam do good for the NSA and bring the organization to justice, or will the lure of the terrorist group overpower and overcome Sam?\n\nThe choices you make affect that outcome.  Moral questions will pop up in various places throughout the game.  Do you shoot a prisoner to earn trust with the JBA, or do you hold off, keeping the NSA on your side?  Whatever outcome you decide on, your trust with one will go down and the other will go up.  This trust system is a new addition to Double Agent.\n\nAs you work your way through ten missions, your best friends are shadow and silence.  You can go in guns blazing, but you won't get far.  As a master spy, Sam will have to sneak around crates and walls, hide under vehicles and tables, sneak through highly guarded areas, and bypass electronic, fingerprint, voiceprint and retinal locked doors.  You must interrogate or hack for keycodes and combinations, and you have the choice of knocking an enemy unconscious or killing them.  When hanging by a rail, you can let an enemy guard walk by, or reach up, grab him and throw him to his death.  Your best weapon is your mouth.  Lure an enemy to your location by whistling, then sneak around him as he abandons his patrol to find the source of the noise.  Your configurable weapon is really a backup.\n\nSam will go on many missions as a double agent.  You'll be visiting the JBA headquarters in New York City, you'll travel to the Congo to rescue a soldier, you'll board a cruise ship in Cozumel wearing shorts in broad daylight with minimal cover, forcing you to change your stealth patterns.  You'll wind up in the middle of a wartorn city, in the middle of a battle between guerrillas and the military, both of which want you dead.  Your missions are varied, and all can be completed without firing a single bullet.\n\nMultiplayer is similar to the past Splinter Cell games.  You take on the role of either a spy or a mercenary; spies are played from the standard, third-person perspective, while mercs are played from the first-person perspective.  Spies are tasked with stealing sensitive documents; mercs are tasked with killing the spies and protecting the documents.  Each side has its own unique weapons and items.  Spies do not have conventional weaponry, meaning nothing that can kill a merc, but they have several gadgets and devices to help them.  Mercs are blessed with a high-powered rifle, grenades, and the ability to toggle various vision modes.\n\nThe PS3 version includes some additional content: a new female spy character (multiplayer), two new maps based on a new environment (multiplayer), a new set of co-op challenges and some refinements for the existing content.",

      "description": "The 2006 game in the <i>Need for Speed</i> series is an evolution of the gameplay introduced in the previous games. The career mode offers complete freedom in a city with a story mode supported by FMV cutscenes, as featured in Need for Speed: Most Wanted, but now also set in the Carbon Canyon, where racers duel for territory in the city below. There still are many police pursuits. At the same time, the focus on tuning and sculpting your car remains, as introduced in Need for Speed Underground. As you win money from races, you can visit garages and car lots to make improvements to your vehicle.\n\nEnhancements are still unlocked gradually, but the cars have now been divided over different tiers. There are about 40 cars to unlock. Many of them have been featured in previous installments, but there is a new selection and this year's edition introduces powerful muscle cars such as the Ford Mustang and Dodge Charger. Other features include the possibility to form your own crew, more detailed sculpting features, drifting races (introduced in <i>NFS:U</i> and replaced by drag races in <i>NFS:MW</i>) and the new car classes. The PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 versions offer online multiplayer, missing from the PS2, GC and Xbox releases. Up to eight players can race together, in the Pursuit Tag or Pursuit Knockout modes, with a few variations. Pursuit Tag is a race of one civilian car against cop cars. To become the civilian car, you have to tag it and then try to fend off the cops as long as possible until you are tagged again by other players. In Pursuit Knockout everyone starts as a civilian car, but the last one at the end of the first lap becomes a cop and needs to cause as much damage as possible to the other speeders. Another mode allows you to drive cooperatively (up to four players) in a single race.\n\nThe city and the surroundings in the career mode have been divided into different territories, controlled by gangs. You are either invited or challenged to race in the sections and claim them as your own. To do so, you have to impress the gang leader by winning races until he challenges you for a duel - first in the city, then over the narrow roads of Carbon Canyon. Scores are based on proximity. You need to follow the boss in the first race, and he is in pursuit in the second one. There are 4 boss duels in total.\n\nThe crew feature, with room for up to 6 cars, allows you to assign three roles to racers: drafters, scouts and blockers. These are supporting characters you can hire to help you win races. Drafters leave behind a coloured trail that makes it easier to find the way, scouts discover hidden shortcuts, and blockers try to cause mayhem to slow your opponents down. If you hire a scout, you get access to the new AutoSculpt feature. It enables you to modify the height of every part of your car through sliders, solely for visual effect. You can also buy full body kits.",

      "description": "The third main <i>Call of Duty</i> game centers around Operation Cobra in Normandy, France, the World War II operation planned by United States Army General Omar Bradley to break out from the Normandy area after the previous month's D-Day landings. You play as 4 allied sides with American, Canadian, British and Polish soldiers in 14 chronological singleplayer missions covering the 88 days leading up to the liberation of Paris. Surprisingly, you cannot play as the French 2nd Armored Division that actually liberated Paris.\n\nThe battles are usually dramatic with many fights and scripted events at the same time, consisting of infantry and vehicles, with semi-destructible environments. In between, there are cinematics that explain the events. A few gameplay mechanics have been kept intact or make a return: slight auto aim, the damage system that allows you to recover if you hide for a moment, and smoke grenades. New features include the ability to toss back unexploded grenades and actions requiring a successful series of button combinations. This can occur in hand-to-hand combat where you can yank the weapon out of enemy soldiers' hands. Enemies work in groups, try different tactics and search for cover.\n\nThe main multiplayer modes are standard deathmatch (battle), team deathmatch (team battle), Capture the Flag (either with two flags or two sides trying to control a single, neutral flag) and Headquarters (two sides either defend or attack a structure, and players can now respawn after dying). The new mode, War, is similar to the gameplay of the Battlefield series. Two teams start with two control points each, and one neutral flag in the middle. The objective is to control all five flags.\n\nThere are multiple-occupancy vehicles (Sherman Tank, Panzer IV, Jeep, Horch, BMW, Harley), and several multiplayer classes: Rifleman, Heavy Assault, Light Assault, Medic, Scout, Support and Anti-Armor. Each class has unique abilities. There are also two rankings: a normal rank system during a single game where your abilities improve if you do well, and an overall TrueSkill ranking. Also, unlike the previous games, your team stays grouped together after a match and is not booted back to the lobby right away.",

Gameplay remains almost identical, but with upgraded graphics and HD 720p support.  Players race on highways around Tokyo.  Cars are purchased and customized with parts that effect cars handling, appearance, and power.  Cars are primarily Japanese-centric or imports for the U.S. market. Vehicle customizations includes body kits, nitrous, neon lights, interior gauges, roll cages, seats, dangly things for your rear view mirror, and many more performance enhancing upgrades from suspension, engine, transmission, and other drivetrain upgrades.  The courses and regions you drive and race on are based on real world locations and other rivals can be found both on the courses and in rest stop areas around Tokyo.  Certain rivals require certain additions to be on your vehicle, or your vehicle to be configured a certain way, or your garage or pocket book to be a certain point before deeming you worthy of a challenge.",

He is forced to take part in more than 75 mini-games, called trials. Rayman will get to throw cows, milk cows, make Rabbids dance - even  race warthogs and eagles... all for the amusement of the Rabbids. After winning games, Rayman will earn plungers which can be used to construct a ladder to escape from the jail cell. After completing three trials in the coliseum, a boss game must be completed; such as an on-rails first person shooter, or a racing game.\n\nDuring the Story Mode, the player unlocks special mini-games which can then be played in Score Mode to unlock new content (such as music, wardrobes and challenges) and  improve scores. Getting a high score in Score Mode also generates a password to allow players to submit their high score to an online rankings system via Ubisoft's home page.   The game can be played in single player mode and multiplayer modes (up to four people in competitative or co-operative gameplay).",

      "description": "Like its predecessor Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Lockdown, Vegas is a more action-driven tactical shooter. You play as Logan Keller who is the leader of a Rainbow Six squad. Controlling two team-members, you have to take on terrorists who attempt to get the city of Las Vegas under their control.\n\nThe missions are all connected with one another through the storyline. You always have different goals like rescuing a hostage or disarming a bomb. To do so, you have access to different kinds of weapons from pistols to Assault Rifles and Gadgets like C4 or Tear Gas. You order your men around by aiming at something and then choosing from a list of options called \"Rules of Engagement\", available in a circle menu much like in Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter. They will then do they best to fulfill your order without risking their own lives by taking cover as often as possible.\n\nInstead of a health indicator and medi-packs scattered around the map, your vision blurs when you get a hit. If you take too many, you die but if you take cover and wait a while, you recover and can once again take on the terrorists.\n\nCompared to earlier versions, there are fewer enemies, but they are harder to kill due to the improved AI. The mission planning has been removed, for the first time weapons can be picked up from dead enemies, and the aiming system has been altered. The story is no longer told to cutscenes as the plot now advances through scenes during gameplay.\n\nIf you have saved Las Vegas or are tired of the AI, you can engage in the multiplayer-modes available for up to 15 other players like Assault & Defend, in which one team needs to take over an objective, defended by the other team, or just plain Deathmatch in the Sharpshooter mode. You can also play through the singleplayer story with friends or go on a hunt for terrorists on random generated maps.",

As the colony grew, humanity encountered The Akrids, a bug-like alien race that declared war on the humans for intruding on  their territory. The humans didn't have any effective means to defend themselves and had to retreat from the planet. During the course of the retreat, a young man named Adam had his father killed by a Akrid named \"Green Eye\". Scientists soon discovered that the Akrids were a source of precious thermal energy, stored inside their bodies. This needed resource gave humanity an economical reason to fight back. On Earth, the Vital Suit was developed, a heavy weapon mech-like vehicle, Returning to E.D.N. III, Adam is among the many Vital Suit pilots, and seeks to avenge his father's death.\n\n<i>Lost Planet: Extreme Condition</i> is a 3rd-person shooter. Controlling Adam, the player makes war on the Akrid armies. Adam's main objective is to destroy Akrid hives, and ultimately defeat \"Green Eye\" but there will be several goals for him to complete along the way.  Adam can hold two weapons and one type of grenade at the same time. In addition, Adam can find different Vital Suit upgrades to give himself new abilities. Since it's very cold on the planet, thermal energy is needed to survive and restores health energy. In order to get it, Adam can either activate Data Posts or destroy things that have it in them like exploding barrels or enemy Akrids. The thermal energy stored slowly decreases over time and needs constant replenishing.\n\n<i>Lost Planet: Extreme Condition</i> also features a multiplayer mode where players can go online and play in four different game-modes against up to 16 other players. Besides the usual Deathmatch and Team-deathmatch; there is \"Station Control\", where players try to find and activate data posts on the map and \"Fugitive\", where one player flees from all the rest killing opponents and waiting for the timer to count down.",

      "description": "It's the year 1941 and you are Lt. Henry Walker a young Navy Officer stationed at Pearl Harbor. You are late for duty and on route to your ship as the Japanese attack the harbor and sink it. Now you first help to defend the harbor and then take the fight all the way to the last Battle of the pacific around the Midway Islands.\n\nYou are limited to control the ships, subs and planes the game gives you in the single-player campaign but in multiplayer-matches you are free to jump into anything that moves and isn't currently occupied by another player. So it's yours to decide at anytime if you want to fly a plane, steer a cruiser or take the on the enemy under water with a submarine anytime you like. Since there are several kinds of ships from Torpedo Boats over Destroyers to Aircraft Carriers and planes like the F4F Wildcat or the SBD Dauntless you have different options and weapons at your disposal. On a Aircraft Carrier for example, which has only AA guns, you can build up squads of airplanes, assign targets and launch them. You can also go to the tactical map if you currently controlling a ship and assign formations, give out orders and so on. Or just jump into a vehicle and do everything yourself instead of letting the AI or the other players take care of it.\n\nThe single-player also features three different challenges, one for each type of vehicle. Each mission inside a challenge puts you in difficult situations you've to master. The first mission in the ship challenge for example gives you control over a Japanese Battleship which has been ambushed and needs to reach safety as US Destroyers advance at it's position.",

      "description": "<i>Test Drive Unlimited</i> lets the player choose one of several characters, both male and female, waiting at an airport to check in for their flight to the Caribbean dream island O'ahu located in Hawaii. The characters do not have different statistics, that only applies to the extravagant, licensed cars.\n\nThe whole island is accessible from the beginning and after the player has bought his first home and car, he can either drive around and look for events or load up the map and jump directly to a location of a race, a car salesman or other locations - similar to Need for Speed Underground. Every bought car has a built-in navigation system, guided by a woman's voice to get the player to his destination, either pre-programmed in the game or decided by the player.\n\nThere are over 125 different cars and motorcycles in different price ranges to choose from. From the Audi TT over the Jaguar XJ200 to the McLaren F1 and Kawasaki Z1000, there is everything the character needs as a young man or girl with too much money on their hands. Each car has its own, realistic set of characteristics such as speed or handling, but they all have a highly detailed exterior and interior in common.\n\nThe character starts with $200.000 dollars in his pocket, but there will not be anything left after buying a first car and home. Additional cash needs to be earned in different kinds of races from checkpoint challenges to time trials. The money cannot only be used to buy new homes and new cars (and a little tuning for those), but also to buy new outfits for the avatar.\n\nThe heart of Test Drive Unlimited is the online mode. Using a GameSpy account, players connect to the official TDU server immediately after loading the game. New options become available online, such as a meeting lounge where the statistics and looks of other players can be looked up. It also provides access to player-created matches shown on the map screen. Creating a race  here also works in the singleplayer modes. At any location, the start and finish can be defined, as well as the type of the race, which type/classes of cars or bikes are allowed and how many people can participate. If not all slots have been filled up by other players, the AI will take control of the rest.\n\nThe PSP and PS2 versions have a lower visual quality and lack a few features, such as manual transmission, avatar customization, certain cars and all motorcycles, dealership and tuning shop NPCs, the vehicle interior camera angle and certain missions. They do include Master Points and Auto GPS, and certain default vehicles only available for the 360 version through download packs.",

      "description": "A long time ago, Aziraal, the god of war and leader of the hordes of Orcs, was slain in a huge battle. After this crushing defeat, the hordes were forced to withdraw to the southern wastelands. A thousands years later, the location of Aziraal's tomb is still unknown because the other gods did not dare to entrust this secret to any mortal. But one day a dwarven mining expedition discovers an ancient temple. The civilized races and the horde came to the same conclusion: in this temple lies the clue to Aziraal's burial ground. So the fragile peace between the two factions is at stake and a silent war has begun, preparing the holy crusade of the Orcs to find and revive their glorious leader. But behind the curtain a powerful force also weaves a secret plot to take the powers for itself.\n\nIn this mess steps a wandering bounty hunter - You - whose sister has been kidnapped by strange figures which demand for the sisters release that he finds several mysterious artifacts...\n\n<i>Two Worlds</i> plays much like Gothic 3. You start in a small tutorial dungeon and after completing it, you are free to roam the big world - taking on side quests while completing your main goal. But you are not alone in the world and many animals or more human-like foes stand in your way. To deal with these enemies, there is the usual choice between magic, melee or ranged combat. You define what you want to be by distributing the skill and param points you gain at each level. The param points go into the four basics (dexterity, strength, vitality and willpower). The skill points are used for different attributes in six different categories (General, Magic, Combat passive, Combat active, Range passive and Range active).\n\nAs always, there are tons of items to discover in the world. They come in very different forms, ranging from weapons and armor to plants and artifacts. Plants can be used to brew potions but no recipes can be found in the world. You have to find all the useful combinations by yourself and then you can save your recipe to automatically brew that potion when you have collected the needed ingredients.\n\nSince your inventory is limited, you can improve the weapons and armor you find on the fly. This is done by combining two identical items. Then you get a more powerful item. Then you can still add more of the same items on top, so even the weakest weapon can become very powerful. In terms of magic you use Boosters to make your basic spell more powerful.\n\nTwo Worlds also features combat while horse-back riding. Other features include teleporters all over the world, a combat system with a realistic hit system (if you swing your sword in a circle, you will hit every enemy in range) and NPCs with a day/night-cycle.",

A group called Lineage decides not to let that happen. They want to preserve the magic for everyone on the planet. A war ensues. \n\n<i>Shadowrun</i> is a first-person shooter set in the cyberpunk-urban fantasy cross-genre based on the license of the same name, but not set in the same universe. Instead, the developer created an alternate continuity. The game takes place in Brazil in 2031, before the events that of the actual Shadowrun universe.\n\nAfter the six chapters of the tutorial the player can either choose to fight against bots or go online and play against up to 15 other players in the three different game modes: Deathmatch, Capture the Flag and Artefacthunt. Each team can choose between the four races: Human, Elf, Troll or Dwarf. Depending on which race you choose, the character has access to different kinds of talents. The Trolls for example have more health than any of the other races and can in addition increase their armor for a short period of time. \n\nFor every enemy killed or flag/artifact retrieved, money is awarded to invest into weapons and spells at the beginning of the round. Only up to three weapons can be used in one round. Grenades also eat up an entire slot. Next to weapons, players can also purchase magic or tech. This includes invulnerability, teleportation, attacks spells, a radiating healing tree and resurrection for magic, and the ability to see through walls, gliders, enhanced physical attributes, increased accuracy, anti-magic generators for tech.\n\n<i>Shadowrun</i> is the first game to feature cross-platform gaming between Windows and the Xbox 360 through the Live service both platforms. If you own a Gold membership for Windows Live (a free month is included in the box) you can play with or against owners of the Xbox360 version and vice versa. To even the odds, the Windows' players aiming reticule is distorted during quick turns and extra stability is given. To counter the pixel-accuracy of Windows players, the Xbox 360 owners are given aim assistance.",

      "description": "<i>DiRT</i> is the first racing game in the Colin McRae series not to solely focus on the rally championship. It features other offroad events with vehicles like buggies, jeeps or trucks all licensed from the manufacturers. Races are not always solo against the times of other drivers, but up to eight cars often race together on a single track.\n\nThe main game mode is the career where you work your up a pyramid of different tiers with events ranging from normal Rallies over Crossover or Corr to Hill Climb. For every event you complete successfully, you get points and money. Money is used to buy new cars. While the amount of money depends on choosing one of the five difficulty levels, the amount of points depends on your final result in the event; you receive the maximum of 10 points for completing an event with a first place regardless of the difficulty level. These points are needed to unlock new events in the current tier. If you have gathered enough points the next tier will be automatically unlocked so you don't need to do every race in a tier in order to unlock the final event at the top. The difficulty level not only influences the strength of the other drivers, but also how critical the damage is upon hitting obstacles. Some events are further split up into two or three races where the damage is carried over and the allotted sixty seconds worth of damage repair is not offered after every subevent. The main parts that can be repaired are the engine, turbo, exhaust, gearbox, bodywork, wheels, suspension, cooling system and it is also possible to clean the entire car.\n\nAll events feature several licensed true-to-detail-vehicles which also have a detailed damage model. Each vehicle can in addition be tuned in several categories like engine or suspension before each event. To help you make it even more individual, you can create your own look of the car with several dozens predefined kits. There are also 182 different liveries to collect in the game and 46 different cars.\n\nIn addition to the career mode, the game features the classic Colin McRae rally mode with four championships where you need to proof your worth in several car categories like 2WD or Classic. Of course you can also do a time trial, a single event or a single race.\n\nIf you're tired of driving only against the AI, you can go online and compete against up to 100 other players at the same time. An official ranking ladder is also available. After each race your best times can be compared directly to other drivers worldwide.",

The games are set in an alternate universe where corporations fights wars and have taken over governmental control.  Due to the growth of the population, food and energy became scarce and widened the gap between the rich and the poor. Anarchy ensued and the government lost control of the situation. People turned to the corporations to provide for safety. Six corporations struggled for power and launched a full scale war, known as the Nation Dismantlement War. A new order was established and Pax Economica was introduced, a system where loyalty guaranteed food and safety.\n\nFive years after the establishment of the Pax Economica, the player takes the role of a member of the Ravens, a rebel group who wants to challenge the modern slavery by force. The player controls a giant Mech, part of a squad, which can be assembled with the available parts, and customized with weapons, paint and aesthetic options. On different locations all over the world, the player fights Mechs from the corporations in 30 missions grouped together in chapters. At the end of each level, new parts become available and the Mech can be repaired with the wages. Multiplayer is supported over the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live.",

      "description": "<i>The Darkness</i> is a first-person shooter based on the Top Cow comic of the same name. Jackie Estacado, a Mafia hit man in modern New York City, becomes possessed by an ancient evil on his 21st birthday. The curse has been passed down through the generations in his family to the first born, starting with his great great grandfather. Jackie is about to be taken out by the henchmen of Mafia don Paulie Franchetti when the curse grants him supernatural powers. He is able to eliminate the hit men and goes after Paulie next, as the Mafia don wants to kill his girlfriend Jenny Romano.\n\nThe game offers a mixture of classic first-person shooting with regular weapons, along with the powers of The Darkness. The latter cannot be used in well-lit environments. In dark areas, Jackie can combine both powers. Jackie can switch back and forth during gameplay, and as The Darkness, the viewpoint is placed lower, but with a broader point-of-view. Darkness powers allow Jackie to summon darklings (different types of creatures), summon dark tentacles that grow from his back to break through barriers and smash opponents, along with maw tentacles for close combat. Estacado can also create a black hole and force it to collapse on itself for wide-range damage, and summon darkness guns that fire lightning bolts.\n\nThe game takes place in a modern environment, but also in the fictional Otherworld and Hell. The Darkness manifests itself as a voice in Jackie's head and tries to gain complete control of the body. The force feeds on the dark and requires a live human body to exist.",

      "description": "Set in ancient China, <i>DW5: Empires</i> brings the Empire mode to the latest DW game, while the basic hack & slash, button mashing gameplay remains the same.\n\nThe Empire mode adds a strategy overlay to the basic game, with a map of 25 areas to conquer. Each turn consists of two parts: empire control, and war making. Your territories bring you tax revenue each turn, which you can spend on various different actions. You can create items and tactics for your generals to use in battle. Recruit generals and troops, fortify your territories, among many other command options. You can wage war on other territories, or may be called upon to defend your own. For each battle you select which generals and lieutenants will fight. There are 4 scenarios to unlock, though they offer little to differentiate each other.\n\nThere is two player split-screen co-op, in either of Empire of Free play modes. Next to the soundtrack of the base game, this edition also adds soundtracks from previous titles, including Dynasty Warriors 2, Dynasty Warriors 3 and Dynasty Warriors 4.",

There is more focus on circuit racing and the point-to-point races have been removed.\n\nThere are 12 tracks in 47 different configurations (both fictional and existing) and over 300 cars with a unique feel that can be modified to the smallest details, mechanical and cosmetic. Cars are classified as Production Cars or Race Cars divided over different classes. Every mechanical part influences the car behaviour and sound, stressing the focus on realism. There are 3 settings: Simulation (large impact of crashes), Limited (light crashes and only a small amount of damage) and Cosmetic (only visible damage, not affecting the car's performance).\n\nThe game modes include a career mode with different classes, time trials, free runs and arcade races. In the career mode, winning races unlocks manufacturer relationships and you can earn money to buy new cars or customize your vehicles. This mode is expanded over Xbox Live with up to 8 human opponents. Players can buy and sell cars through the game's Auction House.",

Following the footsteps of its predecessor, this game is all about damage - earning points by driving is secondary to earning points by wrecking.\n\nThe game's appearance has been vastly updated compared to FlatOut 2. Not only is everything fully in High Definition, the game introduces a large amount of destructible scenery. Literally almost everything can be turned into debris, including traffic lights, fences, even plastic garden chairs.\n\n<i>Ultimate Carnage</i> not only introduces new graphics, it comes up with various new game modes such as the Deathmatch Derby, (in a perhaps intentional nod towards Destruction Derby 2) which feature a closed arena with no defined track; the game objective becomes from a circular racing track to a simple fragging contest.\n\nAs known from the previous editions, the game features both various online modes (all game modes can be played online as well), and the infamously goofy Ragdoll Olympics mode, where most game modes end up with the driver character exiting through the windscreen and ending in grievous bodily harm.",

      "description": "In the year 1960 a plane crashes in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean with a man named Jack as the only survivor. He has the apparent luck of resurfacing in front of what looks like a door to an underwater complex. Without hesitating, Jack enters the door and is greeted by slogans that praise the city of Rapture, a paradise of free will built in the 1940's by a business magnate named Andrew Ryan. However, even before he assimilates all this new information, the descent to this supposed paradise ends and he can only see ruins and chaos. Learning about the destiny of Rapture will be now Jack's main motivation while he tries to survive the horrors that the free will can create.\n\n<i>BioShock</i> is a first-person shooter with gameplay elements and storytelling technique reminiscent of System Shock games. Rapture, the once proud social experiment inspired by the real-world objectivist philosophy of Ayn Rand, has been nearly destroyed, its inhabitants either dead or fallen victims to bizarre scientific experiments. The retro-futuristic setting incorporates elements of sci-fi with art deco and steampunk influences, featuring interior design and propaganda posters reminiscent of 1950's.\n\nThe game's plot is largely revealed through recorded messages left by Rapture's inhabitants before they were killed or mutated. Much of the plot development is therefore dedicated to reconstructing the events of the past, similarly to <i>System Shock</i> games. Limited usage of stealth, the possibility to hack security cameras and other devices, and character customization are the gameplay elements that further tie <i>BioShock</i> to its spiritual predecessors.\n\nIn its core, however, the game is more action-oriented, restricting the role-playing mechanics of <i>System Shock 2</i> to abilities and upgrades that can be acquired and equipped by the main character. Most of the enemies in the game are Splicers, the deformed and insane citizens of Rapture. The protagonist has an arsenal of firearms to combat them, but is also able to use plasmids, which act similarly to magic and deplete a special energy called EVE. Various types of plasmids may directly hurt enemies, sabotage their movements, or enhance the player character's defense. Combat tactics often rely on successive usage of different types of weapons and plasmids. For example, encasing an enemy in ice with a plasmid makes it possible to shatter it to pieces with a single shot; protecting himself with an electric shield, the protagonist can electrocute enemies and strike them with melee weapons, etc.\n\nThe player can only equip a limited number of active and passive plasmids, and also has an inventory limit for every type of item. Restoring and enhancing items can be found by exploring the environment or purchased from vending machines. These can also be hacked, similarly to turrets, cameras, safes, and other types of locks. Hacking is presented as a Pipe Mania-like mini-game.\n\nPlasmids, on the other hand, are mostly purchased by spending certain amounts of a mutagen known as ADAM. This mutagen can be obtained from mysterious creatures called \"Little Sisters\" - little girls that can be seen in most of the game's locations, accompanied and protected by very strong, genetically enhanced humans grafted to armored diving suits and nicknamed \"Big Daddies\". In order to capture a Little Sister the player normally has to defeat her Big Daddy. Afterwards, the player has the choice of killing the girl, harvesting large amounts of ADAM in process, or sparing her life. Depending on the player's moral decisions concerning the Little Sisters, the game's story will be concluded with different endings.\n\nThe Playstation 3 version adds a harder difficulty level called \"Survivor Mode\" to the game.",

      "description": "Boyd Travers is part of the 82d Airborne Division. As a small part of a greater operation he needs to complete several missions in Italy, France, the Netherlands and Germany. He fights alongside AI colleagues in order to free Europe.\n\nAll missions begin with a jump out of an airplane after a short briefing and the chance for you to change your initial weapon loadout. The parachute-jump allows you a little freedom in the selection of your starting point. There's also always a certain area, where you get a bonus if you successfully land there. During these missions anti-aircraft weapons need to be blown up, fellow soldiers have to be rescued and enemy tanks need to be taking out using bazookas. In order to give you more choices in your loadout, you are not only given access to enemy weapons but you can the upgrades you played free. You get an upgrade when you are performing extraordinary feats of valour and marksmanship. This means for example that you earn an upgrade when you kill three enemies in a short order. These upgrades include a bigger magazine for the German K98 or a handle for the Thompson machine gun to make it more accurate.\n\nAlso notable is the health-system. Boyd has four beads of health. If an enemy hits you but doesn't empty a whole bead, your health will regenerate until the bead is full again. If you loose a bead, you need to pick up a health pack in order to regain it.\n\nAlongside the single-player campaign there are also three multiplayer-modes called Team Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch Airborne and Objective for up to 12 players available which all feature the teams Axis against Allied. While Team Deathmatch is pretty standard, Team Deathmatch Airborne features a new twist. In this mode the Allied jump from an airdrop onto the map while the Axis begin on the ground. In objective the goal is to capture all three flags on the map.",

      "description": "After they had fought out their civil war on their homeworld called Stroggos, the Strogg ventured out into space to conquer other planets and study other races to integrate them into their own. In 2060 they enter space above their next target: Earth. The Global Defense Force (GDF) is completely overwhelmed by the attack of this highly advanced force but they don't give up and fight for their survival. Ultimately Earth will fall into the hands of the Strogg and the events which lead to the beginning of Quake II will unfold but until then, you'll be an important part of this last battle for control over the planet!\n\nAs a successor of Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory focuses on objective driven gameplay rather than just capturing flags like you do in the Battlefield Series. This means that on every map one team needs to fulfill an objective while the other needs to guard it. For example on the map \"Valley\" the GDF needs to build a bridge, then drive a MCP over the bridge to a nearby outpost, hack a Strogg-shield so that the MCP can fire a missile into the Strogg base so that the GDF can enter it and destroy a generator.\n\nTo make it even more complex, most objectives need to be completed by a specific class. On each side are five classes and each class has special abilities. The engineer for example can build the bridge on Valley, repair damaged vehicles or deploy identities while the Field Ops supports his teammates by handing out weapons and deploying artillery systems. Since the maps are all pretty big, you also have access to several kinds of vehicles ranging from little quadbikes to helicopters.\n\nUnlike most multiplayer-games, the teams in <i>Enemy Territory: Quake Wars</i> don't just have a different skin but are actually completely asymmetrical balanced from classes over weapons to vehicles. This means that while both teams have a medic, they both function differently. The GDF medic for example behaves like every other medic by instant reviving his teammates but the Strogg technician needs a few seconds before his dead companion is alive again. To balance this out, the Strogg technician can turn dead GDF soldiers into spawn hosts. So if he dies, he respawns at such a host (if it hasn't been destroyed).",

However, the new heart of the game is the Racing career. There you not only create your very own character but you also fully customize your own ride from the general look to nearly every bolt inside. Every GrandPrix features the three stages practice, qualifying and race but you don't need to go through all of them. In addition there are three challenges for every course like Speed Run in which you've 45 seconds to reach the goal and if you're fast enough you can earn either a bronze, silver or a gold medal. The qualifying and race are also watched by the program and you can fulfill several goals like being 1st in qualifying or being on the podium at the end of the race.\n\nAt the end of each GrandPrix you not only get some money to invest into your ride but you also gain some credits with which you increase the stats of your character in the four talent \"Cornering\", \"Braking\", \"Top Speed\" and \"Acceleration\" to make him more like a Pro.\n\nThe fictional \"Extreme\"-mode is also part of the game again and the 17 old tracks have been revised and 20 new motorcycles are waiting to be driven around the courses in both single player and multiplayer.",

The game contains a host of new and old rally cars, as well as concept vehicles. Handling is loose and arcade-oriented, and the setup options are not as detailed as those in DiRT. \n\nThere are fifteen circuits across 5 terrain types - safari, alpine, tropical, canyon and arctic. As such, you must drive through snow, sleet, sand, mud, water and gravel. Track deformation technology ensures that no 2 laps are ever the same, as grooves are impacted into the ground and snow is moved off the primary racing line.\n\nGame modes include Quick Race, Championship, Time Attack and Online multiplayer. Time Attack allows plays to set their best times and upload them to 360 Live or PSN. Similarly, players can download other individuals ghosts and try to beat them. Online multiplayer caters for online battles between up to 6 players.",

      "description": "<i>Halo 3</i> is the third game in the main Halo series.  Like the rest of the series, it is a sci-fi/military-themed first-person shooter with an emphasis on vehicles and an extensive multiplayer mode in addition to the single-player campaign.\n\nAs before, the series' signature shield system is used where, rather than health, you have a force field of sorts which loses power as you are attacked.  You needn't pick up anything to refill it, only take cover for several seconds.  If you can avoid being attacked, the shield will recharge on its own.\n\nVehicles are again present.  These are human and alien transport which can be driven or ridden in with another player or AI doing the driving.  Halo 3 adds numerous new types of vehicles, notably a massive mobile command center called the Elephant and a human VTOL aircraft called the Hornet.  Enemies with good timing can board a vehicle, kicking out the occupant.\n\nAlso as before, you are limited to one weapon in hand (or one in each hand for some of the smaller guns) and one on back-up with both human and alien weapons available.  Weapons can be fired or used to club someone for a melee hit.  There are several new weapons, including the gravity hammer, which is a massive hammer for one-hit kills in close combat.  When using a single weapon, your second trigger throws grenades, which have a new spike type in addition to the basic sticky and frag ones from previous games.  Turrets are back, which are mounted guns with a new missile pod variant and the added ability to rip them off their moorings and carry them around in 3rd person view.\n\nThere is a new feature called equipment where you get objects with particular effects, such as a gravity lift, a shield drain field, a shield recharge field, land mines and a bubble shield which can be penetrated by players, but not gunfire.  One piece of equipment can be carried at a time and it can be deployed anywhere.\n\nAll the multiplayer game types from Halo 2 are back.  This includes the standard fps games like slayer (essentially deathmatch), capture the flag, assault (reverse ctf), territories and king of the hill (territories with a single point).  There are also Halo-specific games, like oddball, where you must hold an object the longest time and juggernaut, where one player gets specials powers.  Only they can score points.  If you kill that player, you become the juggernaut.  Two new games are added: VIP, where you are tasked with killing a specific player on the other team and must protect your own VIP, and infection, which is a human team vs a zombie team and humans are infected and brought to the other team as they are killed.  There are also dozens of variants of these, such as crazy king, which is king of the hill with a moving hill, mad dash which is a juggernaut games where the object is to get to waypoint instead of kill people and single-weapon versions of slayer.  You can make your own custom game types by manipulating a a number of variables such as weapons, goals and player stats.\n\nThis is augmented by Forge, which is a map editor.  While it doesn't have the ability to change level geometry, Forge can be used to completely change object placements.  This is not only weapons and vehicles and power-ups, but spawn points, crates, fusions coils (exploding barrels), etc.  The map editor is actually a playable game mode with some players becoming the monitor and placing objects for use by their teammates.  They can give give them a tank, for instance, or create a barrier and levitate it along as mobile cover.\n\nThe campaign mode contains a number of new features as well.  The players now control distinct characters in co-op rather than the Chief just having an identical twin, the player limit has been expanded to four and it is now playable online.  There is a metagame where you score points in the campaign (used for some of the achievements) and the skulls from <i>Halo 2</i> have been expanded with a checklist and additional features, such as unlocking extra armor for use in multiplayer and additional dialogue featured throughout the game.\n\nThe ability to customize your appearance has been expanded from <i>Halo 2</i> with not only a longer list of emblems to place on your armor and the ability to pick a third color, but multiple armor variants which can be mixed and matched and the ability to use a female voice.\n\nOther new features include a theater where you can re-watch games you or others played from the viewpoint of any player-character or in third-person or with a free camera.  You have the ability to save films for posterity, take screenshots or edit films for highlight reels or machinima (multiplayer only).  This is a multiplayer feature, so you can watch films with people in your online party.\n\nAll of these things (edited maps, custom games, films and screenshots) can be put in a new file-sharing feature and are accessible to other players or through any PC via the internet.",

      "description": "<i>Stuntman: Ignition</i> is a game based on the original 2002 Stuntman game. Players assume the role of a Hollywood stunt driver working for a movie studio. Each level is based upon a movie and players will have to drive through the level, earning points by performing stunts. After the end of each level, players can review their performance by watching the movie trailer that was created.\n\nThere are six movies to choose from, each with different settings, goals and challenges: Aftershock, Whoopin and a Hollerin' II, Strike Force Omega, Overdrive, Never Kill Me Again and Night Avenger. Each movie consists of 6 scenes where the goals set by the director must be followed. To progress, a successful series of stunts is required, but the amount of points can be increased by linking them together and adding extra danger by drifting, getting airborne, or getting close to other cars and obstacles.\n\nThe multiplayer portion offers 2 game modes. In Backlot Battle players have to perform as many stunts as possible in a set amount of laps. Backlot Race offers straightforward racing where boost is earned through stunts. The PS2 version only offers offline gameplay, while the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions have multiplayer supported through the DemonWare middleware.",

      "description": "The Bible tells us that God created Adam as an image of himself - that is not true. It is also not true that Adam was the first thinking being to walk upon the earth. In the beginning was the Firstborn. The Firstborn was a true image of God. Perfect to the core, a creature with no sex, neither dark nor light and both beautiful and terrible to behold. God feared his creation and left it unfinished, banishing it to the Abyss and created Adam instead with all his flaws.\n\nBut the Firstborn had already touched the Earth. Leaving behind a taint so powerful that even God's expulsion couldn't keep it from breaking through into the mortal world to reclaim it's birthright. In a remote desert in the Middle East the Earth was wounded. Eon after eon the Firstborn continued to fester, breaking down the fabric of reality as human civilisation flourished around it.\n\nAccording to an ancient prophecy the Firstborn will successfully break through into the mortal world seven times. Bringing with it diseases, corruption and perversity until seven mystics come and sacrifice themselves to drive it back into the abyss. This has already happened six times. Now once again the ground under the city called Al-Khali trembles as the Firstborn enters the world one last time to either be defeated in a last battle or find eternal freedom.\n\nDuring the centuries every civilisation made sure that those seven mystics would stand ready to defeat the Firstborn and this hasn't changed. Known as the Jericho Squad they are now called to Al-Kahli. The city in which one travels further back in time as he ventures deeper into its heart until he reaches the beginning of all.\n\nThe game is a pretty straight-forward First Person Shooter but every one of the seven members of the Jericho Squad has different abilities and uses different weapons. While Cpt. Devin Ross uses the Patrioteer (a combination of shotgun and assault rifle) and is besides Father Paul Rawlings the only member of the team that can heal wounded teammates, Sgt. Wilhelmina \"Billie\" Church is more of a samurai. She uses a Nodachi as a melee-weapon and a rapid-fire sub-machine gun in addition to Blood magic which allows her to summon either a Blood or a Fire Ward.\n\nAlthough your teammates do a pretty good job on their own, later on you have the ability to take over one of them and do whatever you want to do yourself. The squad is also divided into two teams which you can give the orders \"Hold\" or \"Follow\" which comes in handy if you position one team to cover your six and take the rest with you into the fight.\n\nThe health system is somewhat similar to games like Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Vegas or Call of Duty. This means that there are no health packs scattered around. When you're hit you have to search for cover to regenerate. If you are hurt badly enough you'll go to the ground but as mentioned Ross and Rawlings can bring you back to life. The game only ends if you can't be healed fast enough or both Ross and Rawlings are dead.\n\nAs the name suggests, Clive Barker, the maker of the Hellraiser movies, had great influence in the making of the whole game including art-direction and background story but <i>Clive Barker's Jericho</i> is not the successor to Clive Barker's Undying.",

      "description": "In the nearby future scientists develop a so-called Quantum suit that allows the carrier to travel through time. Two prototypes called Alpha and Betasuit are ready for testing when Aiden Krone enters the lab, steals the Alphasuit and makes a time-jump before he blows up the building. Luckily you were there and had the chance to jump into the Betasuit and activate the time travel before the building was destroyed. But it took the suit a second too long to jump so the explosion hit it and your jump didn't go as planned. When you wake up in an alley in the future you quickly realize that Krone has already declared himself leader of the world and transformed it into a totalitarian state with him as the dictator. Shortly after waking up, you are found by some rebels and you join their task in order to stop Krone and fix the timeline since your suit was too badly damaged by the blast.\n\nFight your way through hordes of enemies with futuristic, but also conventional weapons like pistols or shotguns. Your suit isn't rendered totally useless. It still allows you to slow down, rewind and forward time for a short period. This not only allows you to overcome obstacles like fire but you can also trick your enemies. Players can slow down the time and then steal the weapon out of the hand of an enemy - if he hasn't a too strong grip on it. This feature is also used for small time-related puzzles. \n\nThere are notable differences with the time manipulation element from the Prince of Persia series. Manipulating the time won't affect yourself and when you are too badly wounded and die, you can't just rewind. You remain dead and have to reload. The game also doesn't feature medipacks. Instead the hero just needs to rest for a second if he is wounded and will then be fully healed again.\n\nManipulating time is also part of the multiplayer-experience. Besides the normal game-modes Deathmatch, Team-Deathmatch, One-on-One and Capture the flag, the game also features King of Time and Meltdown Madness.\n\nIn King of Time there's a Time Sphere in the center of the map which makes you impervious to all time effects. To win the game you need to rack up kills while you have the item. Meltdown Madness instead requires of you to throw Chrono Grenades at the opposing team's machine to prevent it from functioning. Once a machine of a team has completed his countdown, that team wins.\n\nThe Chrono Grenades are also part of all the other game modes in addition to the Time Shield and the Time Resistance power-up. While the Chrono Grenades come in the three flavors and slow down, forward or rewind time in the area of the blast. The Time Shield not only makes you immune to time manipulation but also slows down every foreign object in a specific area which is good for dodging enemy fire. The Time Resistance power-up grants immunity against all time effects for a short period of time.",

      "description": "<i>Crysis</i>, the first game of a planned trilogy, is a first-person shooter set in the year 2019 and the spiritual successor to Far Cry. The player takes on the role of the US soldier Jake Dunn. On a remote Pacific island a meteor has been excavated and the North Korean army quickly moved in to secure the location. After they capture a team of US archaeologists the US Army sends in a Delta Force team to investigate and free the scientists. Most of the missions are played along, but often with a AI squad that also star in the cutscenes and play a crucial part in the story.\n\nDuring the battles with the North Korean soldiers it becomes apparent that there is an even greater threat. When the meteor opens up a huge alien ship is revealed that starts to xenoform the island by freezing it over. The Americans and North Koreans are forced to join forces when alien machines emerge from the vessel and attack both sides. Now both sides have to stop the xenoforming process together.\n\n<i>Crysis</i> offers a singleplayer campaign as well as an objective based multiplayer for up to 32 players. One of the main innovations of the game is the so called Nanosuit. This high tech combat suit allows the player to increase his speed, strength or speed for short amounts of time. Jake Dunn and his fellow soldiers can get into a cloaking mode, become invisible and it restores health when powered up.\n\nIn the single player campaign the player will encounter several enemy types. A large part is spent fighting North-Korean soldiers. Aliens are first encountered in a Zero-G environment once the meteorite has been breached. When leaving the meteorite the actual alien invasion begins and the player then mainly faces small alien scouts and the larger alien hunters.\n\nDuring the campaign there are a number of more or less typical shooter weapons to be gathered, such as machineguns, a shotgun, a missile launcher, a sniper rifle, explosives, various types of grenades and a gauss gun. In the later weapons there are also some alien weapons which can freeze opponents. Not all weapons can be held at once, they can be swapped for the ones from the bodies of dead soldiers and most of the weapons have a limited amount of ammo. There is also an extensive weapons upgrade feature which is available from the start and allows the player to reconfigure weapon configurations on the fly. Tactical or explosive ammunition can be added, or a flashlight, a laserscope, a silencer, grenades and more. Most of the weapons have multiple firing options, from single bullets to rapid bursts.\n\nAlmost any vehicle can be driven, from jeeps to large vans, regular cars, tanks and patrol boats. Most of these have mounted weapons. Other equipment includes binoculars, nightvision, a radar with targets in the bottom left corner of the screen and a direct voice connection with other squad members.\n\nJust like Crytek's previous game <i>Far Cry</i>, it comes with a sandbox editor to create new levels. The console versions do not have the expansions and do not support multiplayer.",

As usual, multiplayer is also available with different game modes.\n\nThe missions in the single player campaign give various tasks to accomplish and take the player through many twists as the plot unfolds.

The game doesn't have a Free Roam mode (as in Underground 2, Most Wanted or Carbon), but it has an Event Map, similar to Juiced's Event Calendar.\n\nThe player's main goal in this game is to become the \"King of the street\". Nothing new. However, there are no more illegal races in the game - all of the available races are sponsored, and the action takes place on different racing tracks. No more traffic, no more in-town driving.\n\nThe game features 2 gameplay modes. Career (you start your \"life\" as a lowlife race driver and over time you will conquer everyone) and free play (where you can race unlocked cars and unlocked tracks).\n\nAs usual, the game includes a jukebox where you can listen to some singles, used by EA as the game's Sound Track.\nThe game also includes new car models, and the classic racing modes except for cop chases, since ProStreet does not promote illegal racing. Also as usual, when you first start the game you will be prompted to create an alias (profile). You can choose which one will be loaded when you start the game again. After creating the alias, you are prompted to choose your difficulty settings.\n\nAll versions, except for the PlayStation 2 and Wii, contain online multiplayer modes.",

      "description": "It was supposed to be a routine mission three years ago. Enter a bunker deep inside Iraq-territory, retrieve a chemical weapon and get out. But inside the complex was no chemical weapon. Instead you encounter mutated humans and other strange creatures. With one man down you escape that hell and move on.\n\nNow you are called to Nevada because something terrible happened there (see Area-51) and it affected the nearby city. But you soon realize, that all this has something to do with what you encountered inside the bunker three years ago.\n\nThe game is a pretty straight-forward first person shooter. You move through the levels, kill everything that moves and fulfil your objectives. To aid you in that task, you've a squad full of people under your command. With the help of cursor-sensitive commands you order them around and let them man a stationary MG for example. But there are also marked points in the levels at which your squad will perform scripted tasks like a door breach.\n\nDepending on the difficulty you need to watch the moral of your team mates very carefully. While a high morale will make your squad very aggressive and increase their aim, they'll take more cover and be less accurate when they don't feel so confident. To increase morale you just need to do a good job or give your team mates a common target to shoot at.\n\nThe game also features a multiplayer-mode with several game modes. These include Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag and Abduction. In Abduction there are two teams: the humans and the Reborn. One player randomly starts as a Reborn and whenever a Reborn kills a human, the human will respawn as a Reborn. For such a kill a Reborn gets two points and all surviving humans gain a bonus point. After all humans are abducted, the round ends and the player with the most points wins the match.",

      "description": "The alien race known as Necris is still fighting against the humans but when they attack the Twin Souls mining colony, they made a big mistake because it was the hometown of James \"Reaper\" Hawkins. He now seeks revenge together with his sister Sarah and his team mates Terrence Marshall and Jeremiah O'Connor. To get it over with they join the Izanagi Corporation where they get transferred into a special ops division lead by none other than long time tournament champion Malcolm.\n\nIn the single-player campaign you take control over Reaper and fight in closed matches in the different available gameplay-modes against the Necris and other enemies of the Corporation. To convince your enemies that they are wrong, you will find the usual arsenal of known Unreal Tournament-weapons scattered around the map. These include the humiliating impact hammer, the Trident Tri-barrel Rocket Launcher and the devastating Redeemer. The famous Translocator is also back again to allow you fast movement around the maps. But it's not the only means of transportation in <i>Unreal Tournament III</i>.\n\nLike in Unreal Tournament 2004 many maps also feature vehicles like the Axon Goliath or the Necris Darkwalker. In addition to that you also have at all time access to the new Hoverboard which allows you to travel fast but you can't use any weapons at the same time.There's also game-mode called Vehicle CTF where the different machines are essential in winning the round.\n\nThe other game-modes, which are all available in single player and multiplayer, contain the usual like Deathmatch and Capture the Flag but also the new Warfare-mode. In this mode you need to destroy the enemy Power Core. But the power core only becomes vulnerable when you've captured the Nodes leading to the core with power Orbs that spawn in your base. Warfare also replaces the popular Onslaught-mode known from the previous games. Bombing Run also didn't make it from Unreal Tournament 2004 into the new game.",

      "description": "<i>Dream Chronicles</i> is an unusual casual puzzle/adventure game that assigns the player the role of Faye, a young woman, whose husband, Fidget, has been whisked away via magical means by Lilith, a mysterious fairy. To ensure that Faye's husband stays with her, Lilith has put an entire kingdom to sleep. Somehow, Faye wasn't affected, and now, it is her purpose to rescue her husband and to save the kingdom in process.\n\nThe game comprises 18 chapters (screens), in each location a specific set of puzzles should be solved and a number of jewels located, by playing a <a href=\"http://www.mobygames.com/game-group/hidden-object-games\">Hidden Objects</a> type of game. Those jewels do not assist in solving puzzles, but instead help to unravel the mysteries surrounding the story and increase the player's final score. Player can take his time  while solving the puzzles, however, his final score will be affected if it takes too long.\n\nThe puzzles presented by the game vary from classical inventory-based puzzles to mathematic and logic puzzles reminiscent of Myst. Another resemblance Dream Chronicles shares with Myst is its presentation, which is the same pre-rendered 3D stills viewed from the first person perspective.\n\nHowever, due to its casual nature the game incorporated a number of limitations to the formula of classic adventure. All of the game puzzles must be solved within the limits of one screen and player is not allowed to move any further, before solving the puzzles for a present chapter. Previously completed chapters cannot be revisited either, and all the jewels left in them are gone for good.\n\n<i>Dream Chronicles</i> boasts a fairy-tale approach to its artwork and music, trying to create an interesting and gripping story through the series of visions, diary entries and various comments on the events by the game's protagonist.",

      "description": "<i>Monster Jam</i> is a monster truck racing game based on the existing TV-show under the same name, which also incorporates a series of live events hosted by Live Nation. Unlike previous games of Monster Jam franchise, Monster Jam includes 20 pre-existing trucks licensed specifically for the game by USHRA (United States Hot Rod Association). The game includes such well-known monster trucks as Destroyer, Bounty Hunter, Blue Thunder, Captain's Cruise, it's previous identity - Bulldozer and probably two of the most alleged kings of all monster trucks - Maximum Destruction, the winner of seven Monster Jam World Finals and Grave Digger, one of the most influential monster trucks of all time .\n\nAt the beginning of the game only a small amount of trucks and tracks is available for choosing. The player is encouraged to participate in various events to attain career points which will unlock new items. The amount of points given depend on the player's performance in the following events:\n<ul>\n<li> <b>Freestyle</b> - a classic monster truck challenge involves free-riding at the arena performing different stunts and interacting with the surrounding environment in the most destructive way possible. In this challenge it is advisable to \"keep the action going\" until the time runs out. Also, a combo of different stunts in a succession will result in magnifying the score.</li>\n\n<li><b>Track Circuit</b> - an offroad lap-based racing through various types of countryside.</li>\n\n<li><b>Eliminator</b> - is the classic knock-out race in which  each lap eliminates the last truck to complete it.</li>\n\n<li><b>Stadium Circuit</b> - is the same as Track Circuit with the action taking the place in the arena, and not at outdoors locations and the trucks competing at different tracks separated from each other.</li>\n\n<li><b>Stadium Racing</b> - is a drag racing challenge in which players should boost their maximum speed in order to arrive first at the finish of a short un-circled track.</li>\n</ul>\nOnce the sufficient number points is achieved the player will be allowed to participate in Monster Jam World Finals to prove his right to be the ultimate champion of Monster Jam.\n\nThe game makes heavy emphasis on it's fully destructible levels. Nearly everything player meets on the track may be crushed, moved or destroyed. The game encourages such kind of behavior by issuing additional points and allowing player to use \"nitro boost\" for a prolonged amount of time.\n\nThe game may be played in two difficulty modes: \"Normal\" - is enough for everyone, while \"Pro\" is meant for die-hard Monster Truck enthusiasts only.

      "description": "<i>Burnout Paradise</i> is the first installment in the long-running series, well known for its extreme 60-frames-per-second speed and crash-oriented carnage, to appear on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.\n\nThis title does away with menus to create a seamless integration of event gameplay and online interaction. Rather than dividing races into different sections, the player can fully explore Paradise City as an open world, where every junction is an opportunity to start an event. Just pull up at the traffic lights and rev the engine to start an event. The same applies to the Showtime mode (formerly Crash mode). The preset junctions and traffic are no longer present and the player can now crash at any location in the world, by activating the Showtime mode. It can also be used in regular modes, as well as online games. The main game mode has the player earn credit to unlock new licenses and cars. The five main event types are:<ul>\n<li>Race: the first one to reach the finish wins.</li>\n<li>Road Rage: perform a number of takedowns before time runs out.</li>\n<li>Marked Man: race for a location and survive the attacks from another car that tries to take you down.</li>\n<li>Stunt Run: use stunt moves to reach a target score.</li>\n<li>Burning Route: a unique route for each car in the game.</li></ul>There are more than 80 cars present and there is a reworked damage system. More parts can be torn off and the state of the car determines if the player can keep driving or has to wait for a reset. Objects in the environment can now also be deformed.\n\nThe game supports mugshots with support for a camera. When a player is taken down, both players have their photo taken, exchanged and saved on the hard drive. There are also camera-less persons or an avatar can be used.",

      "description": "Dr. Vladimir Chaosky has been missing from the face of the Earth for more than a decade. Now the trail of this Dr. Chaos gets warm again as he resurfaces bent on continuing his criminal ways. As a sole agent of Interpol you must travel the globe and search for clues and finally bring this madman to justice.\n\n<i>Interpol: The Trail of Dr. Chaos</i> is for the most part a typical hidden object game. As is typical of this genre you must identify the listed objects in a photo-illustration. Few variations on the hidden object game-play conventions being level-end-puzzles where you must complete such tasks as identify differences between two photographs or simply finding the mistakes in one single photo to complete the level. If however you get stuck with a specific item and can't move to the next city there's a handy hint feature that will highlight any item you want from the list. The one other large thing that makes this game different is the almost completely immersive interface. From your icons to the world maps to the menu screens, the entire game is production designed to convey a sense of using Interpol computers and equipment to solve the puzzles.\n\nEach level is typically split into three stages and each level is themed after a world famous city. For example if your search takes you to New York, you can expect to scour The Statue of Liberty, Radio City Music Hall or The Brooklyn Bridge for clues.  Other cities you can expect to explore include Paris, Moscow, Tokyo, Hollywood, London and more. If however you get stuck with a specific item and can't move to the next city there's a handy hint feature that will highlight any item you want from the list.",

      "description": "Lincoln Graves is a 47-year old ex-Special Forces sniper and Reggie Lang is a former FBI-heavy weapons specialist. Graves doesn't really like Lang but they are now both agents of the CIA's Special Activities Division and their mission is to prevent a third-world dictatorship from gaining nuclear weapons.\n\nThis mission takes the team across three continents and through hordes of bad guys. To deal with them, both Lang and Graves have access to several types of weapons from pistols over snipers to machine guns, rocket launchers and several different kinds of grenades. But they also earn upgrades for these weapons after successfully finishing a mission. The first upgrade to Graves's 7.62m Sniper Rifle for example allows the player to fire a bullet around the corner or over low cover.\n\nSince Lang and Graves are a team, the player is free to switch between both at any time and give orders to the currently AI-controlled comrade including simple tasks like \"Follow Me\" or \"Cover Me\" but they can also complete an objective for you or bring you back into the game when your character took one bullet to much.\n\nThe health system is similar to the one in Clive Barker's Jericho which means that you won't find any health packs but instead will heal yourself automatically once you stop taking damage. But if you take too much damage, you'll go down and your team mate needs to revive you. The game only ends when both Lang and Graves are down at the same time.\n\nAn added bonus are the several different kinds of vehicles in the game of which you can take over control and drive over the bad guys or blow them to hell.\n\nThe game can also be played cooperative over LAN and Internet where one player takes over the control of Lang and the other over Graves. But there are also other gameplay modes for up to 16 players like Deathmatch or Conquest, in which two teams compete over the control of five flags on the map.",

      "description": "It all begun in summer 2008 when the global demand for oil exceeded the production capacity of the oil companies. Now it's the year 2024. Oil is as good as none existent and alternate energy sources fail to provide what is needed. And to make it all worse, World War III is at hand since Russia and China formed the Red Star Alliance in order to fight the USA and Europe, now known as the Western Coalition for the last oil reserves on earth. You are a member of the Stray Dogs-squad and as a part of the Western Coalition it is your duty to fight off the Red Star Alliance and secure the oil.\n\nThe story of the campaign is told from the view of Wayne Andrews (but you don't play him). He's a member of the press that was assigned to accompany the Stray Dogs in order to make them heroes and give the people back at home something to look forward to. But war is unpredictable...\n\nThe goal of the game is always to conquer certain points on the map in order to move the frontline forward. But since you need to control at least two of those control points in order to advance, you also need to make sure that parts of your team defend the already converted point while you engage and take over the other ones.\n\nTo fight your enemies you've not only access to slightly futuristic equipment including exploding drones or a small radio-controlled tank but also to assault rifles, rocket launchers and other weapons that make a dent in the enemy armor. There are also several kinds of vehicles waiting for you. Ranging from jeeps over tanks to helicopters there's everything you need to dominate the battlefield.\n\nIn single player you only play one character which can use everything he finds on the battlefield. In multiplayer you choose different weapon load-outs and roles. A Dronetech for example makes use of the different radio-controlled vehicles in the game. During a round you can earn experience by killing enemies or capturing control points. Once you've gathered enough, you gain a level and get access to more equipment in your role but once the round has ended, these are reset and on the next map you once again start as a lowly Level 1 (of 3) in your role.",

      "description": "<i>Turok</i> is a first-person shooter game set in the near future. There is no relationship with the previous games or the storyline from the comic books. The protagonist is Joseph Turok, a former member of Wolf Pack (the enemy in this game), but now a member of Whiskey Company. The mission that led to the events of the game was simple: find Roland Kane (leader of Wolf Pack, and Turok's former mentor) and bring him back to Earth. However, things turned ugly, as the ship was hit by a missile and crashed on the back-water planet. Even worse, it becomes apparent that scientists from the Mendel Gruman Corporation have been terra-forming the planet for accelerated evolution, resulting in dinosaurs hunting Turok, his allies, and his enemy. Joseph Turok's mission is to survive at all costs.\n\nGameplay is about surviving in dangerous environments with both human soldiers and dinosaurs. The dinosaurs can be used as a tool to eliminate soldiers by luring them. All weapons have secondary functions such as a flares to lure dinos. Turok can also choose a stealthy approach with arrows and his trusty knife, in the form of brutal kills. Online multiplayer is also featured, with all the weapons from the single-player game, and some maps have dinos and giant scorpions. The gameplay modes include classics like Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, and all-new modes borrowed from objective-based war games, such as Assault Capture the flag, and co-op missions. They all have a little twist to them, such as CTF putting a lure on the \"flag carrier\" that draws dinos to the player.",
