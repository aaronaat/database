      "description": "The Confederation have been at war with the Kilrathi for the past 20 years, and you're just now joining the Vega campaign. You're a 2nd Lieutenant just out of the Academy, with some good work under your belt. You're posted to Tiger's Claw, the flagship of the Confederation Fleet.  Will you help the Confederation to victory, or go down in infamy? \n\n<i>Wing Commander</i> is a space combat simulator interspersed with shipboard dialogs. Onboard the ship, you can save/load game, visit the bar to get the latest gossip, or go on to the next mission briefing, and the 3D space combat part. \n\nThe 3D space combat has you sitting in the cockpit, where you control the craft like roll, turn, up/down, afterburner, as well as fire guns and launch missiles. There are four different crafts on the Confed side, each with different flight characteristics and armament. You will have a wingman on each mission, and you should keep the wingman alive as the wingman will help you if you issue the right orders. You can also taunt the enemy. You'll be fighting several different types of enemy fighters and capital ships, and even combat a few Kilrathi aces. \n\nWhen the mission is complete, land back onboard the ship and get ready for the next one. The campaign tree has both winning and losing paths. \n\n",

      "description": "A young physics professor named Lester conducts a particle experiment. Suddenly, something goes wrong, a lightning strikes, and in a moment Lester finds himself in a strange alien world. Now he must fight for his life, first with his bare hands, then with a gun he finds. But what gives him courage is that he is not alone. One of the aliens who escapes from the prison together with him helps him on his dangerous quest. Friendship can overcome all the obstacles.\n\n<i>Out of This World</i> combines shooting, platforming, and puzzle-solving elements. The game is divided into stages; some of them are straightforward and can only be accessed one time, while others are connected to each other, constituting a larger environment. Exploration and problem-solving are emphasized. Many levels include challenges not seen in the previous ones. Tasks may involve environmental puzzles, timed sequences, precise jumping, and combat.\n\nTypically, enemies are defeated by using an energy gun found in an early stage. The gun's regular function is shooting energy projectiles. By pressing down and holding the fire button the player can activate an energy shield which protects Lester from regular attacks, allowing him to fire from relative safety until it evaporates. Finally, by holding the fire button even longer the gun creates powerful blasts which can disrupt shields. Most enemies are equipped with similar guns and are able to perform the same actions as Lester. Fighting enemies therefore requires tactical usage of regular attacks, shields, and bombs, as well as learning enemy patterns.\n\nEach level can be accessed by typing a code the player learns after having completed the level. If Lester dies, the level must be restarted. There is no on-screen interface and no in-game dialogue in the game. Vector graphics are used for creating the game's environments and animated cutscenes.

      "description": "The Union Aerospace Corporation has been experimenting with teleportation technology on Mars' moons Phobos and Deimos. After early successes, something goes wrong. It seems the scientists have opened a gateway straight to Hell. Phobos base is overrun with demonic creatures, and the whole of Deimos simply vanishes. A squad of marines is sent to Phobos, but all except one are quickly slaughtered. It falls to the surviving marine to grab some guns and strike back at the demons.\n\nid Software's follow-up to their genre-defining Wolfenstein 3D, <i>DOOM</i> is another first-person 3D shooter: full-on action seen from the space marine's perspective. Like Wolfenstein, the game consists of distinct episodes, playable in any order. The first episode, <i>Knee-Deep in the Dead</i>, takes place in the Phobos base and is freely available as shareware. The full game continues on Deimos in <i>The Shores of Hell</i> and culminates in <i>Inferno</i>, the final episode which takes place in Hell itself (the Sega 32x version lacks this episode).\n\nThe basic objective in each level is simply to reach the exit. Since dozens of enemies stand in the way, the only way to get there is through killing them. Switches and buttons must be pressed to advance at certain points and often color-coded locked doors will block the way - matching keycards or skull keys must be found to pass.\n\nThe game's engine technology is more advanced than Wolfenstein's, and thus the levels are more varied and complex. The engine simulates different heights (stairs and lifts appear frequently) and different lighting conditions (some rooms are pitch black, others only barely illuminated). There are outdoor areas, pools of radioactive waste that hurt the player, ceilings that come down and crush him, and unlike Wolfenstein's orthogonally aligned corridors, the walls in <i>DOOM</i> can be in any angle to each other. An automap helps in navigating the levels.\n\nStylistically, the levels begin with a futuristic theme in the military base on Phobos and gradually change to a hellish environment, complete with satanic symbols (pentagrams, upside-down-crosses and portraits of horned demons), hung-up mutilated corpses and the distorted faces of the damned.\n\n<i>DOOM</i> features a large weapon arsenal, with most weapons having both advantages and drawbacks. The starting weapons are the fists and a simple pistol. Also available are a shotgun (high damage, slow reload, not good at distances), a chaingun (high firing rate, but slightly inaccurate in longer bursts) and a plasma rifle (combining a high firing rate and large damage). The rocket launcher also deals out lots of damage, but the explosion causes blast damage and must be used with care in confined areas or it might prove deadly to the player as well as the enemies. Two further weapons in the game are the chainsaw for close-quarter carnage, and the BFG9000 energy gun, that, while taking some practice to fire correctly, can destroy most enemies in a single burst. The different weapons use four different ammunition types (bullets, shells, rockets and energy cells), so collecting the right type for a certain gun is important.\n\nThe game drops some of Wolfenstein's arcade-inspired aspects, so there are no extra lives or treasures to be collected for points, but many other power-ups are still available. Medpacks heal damage while armor protects from receiving it in the first place. Backpacks allow more ammunition to be carried, a computer map reveals the whole layout of the level on the automap (including any secret areas), light amplification visors illuminate dark areas and radiation suits allow travel over waste without taking damage. Also available are berserk packs (which radically increase the damage inflicted by the fists) as well as short-time invisibility and invulnerability power-ups.\n\nThe enemies to be destroyed include former humans corrupted during the invasion, plus demons in all shapes and sizes: fireball-throwing imps, floating skulls, pink-skinned demons with powerful bite attacks and large one-eyed flying monstrosities called Cacodemons. Each episode ends with a boss battle against one or two especially powerful creatures.\n\n<i>DOOM</i> popularized multiplayer in the genre with two different modes: Cooperative allows players to move through the single-player game together, while Deathmatch is a competitive game type where players blast at each other to collect 'frag' points for a kill and re-spawn in a random location after being killed.\n\nThe 3DO and Sega32x ports lack any multiplayer modes, though the other ports retain the DOS versions multiplayer to varying degree. The various console ports all feature simplified levels and omit some levels, enemies and features from the original DOS release. The SNES and Gameboy Advance versions of the game actually use different engines and hence feature numerous small gameplay differences.",

      "description": "This is an arcade rail-shooter based on the film <i>Terminator 2: Judgment Day</i>. Up to two players shoot through future and present levels as robotic killers reprogrammed to serve the human resistance. \n\nBoth players wield a machine gun with infinite ammo that lowers its firing rate (overheats) as it is continuously fired. A secondary weapon (missile launchers in the future, shotguns in the present) has limited ammo but deals heavy damage. Powerups inside the game world include secondary weapon ammo and coolant for the machine guns, and are shot to be collected.\n\n<i>Terminator 2: Judgment Day</i>, renamed <i>T2: The Arcade Game</i> for home conversions, features seven levels based on specific scenes or general concepts in the film. The first four levels act as a prelude, as the player guns down waves of metal Terminators across a post-apocalyptic Battlefield, a besieged Human Hideout, and through the security checkpoints of the enemy supercomputer SkyNet. After destroying the computer, players travel back in time to protect John and Sarah Connor, while also destroying every scrap of SkyNet research at the headquarters of its manufacturer. From there, players must fend off the indestructible T-1000 until the final showdown in the Steel Mill.\n\nAssets from the movie are used when possible, such as voice clips from Arnold Schwarzenegger, and close-up digital stills of Robert Patrick for the final battle against the T-1000. The Genesis and SNES versions also support lightguns (the Menacer and Super Scope, respectively).",

The three Vikings will have to combine their unique skills to defeat Tomator, as well as a vast array of aliens, robots, giant snails, big lizards and more.\n\n<i>The Lost Vikings</i> is a side-scrolling platform puzzle game with a twist. Instead of one character who can jump, run, shoot, collect items, flip switches and so on, there are three different characters, each with his own skills. Eric the Swift can jump, run and bash through walls with his tough helmet. Olaf the Stout has a shield which can block attacks, function as an air glider or as a step to stand on. Baleog the Fierce can shoot things with his arrows (including switches) or kill things with his sword. The player has to use the three Vikings as a team if he wants to get past the increasingly difficult levels and puzzles.\n\nThe player controls one Viking at a time, but can switch between them at any point. The Vikings have limited space in their inventory which they can use to keep various items. Each Viking has three health points, and if he loses them all from confrontations with dangers, he dies (some threats kill instantly), and the level must be restarted. ",

Many fighters answer the challenge to participate, including several of Ultratech's experimental warriors.  To increase the tournament's challenge, Ultratech utilizes a technology that can create bridges between alternate dimensions, releasing a creature known as Eyedol.  Eyedol is a two-headed ancient warrior that was imprisoned along with his bitter rival, Gargos. Some warriors enter the tournament to seek glory or escape.  Other fighters are attempting to bring an end to Ultratech's corruption.  \n\n<i>Killer Instinct</i> is a 2D versus fighting game that features 3D rendered sprite based graphics. Players choose from ten characters: Orchid, Cinder, Jago, Glacius, Fulgore, Riptor, Sabrewulf, Spinal, T.J. Combo, and Thunder. The game is known for its heavy combo-based fighting system, allowing players to pull off moves that land a high number of hits on their opponent, the highest being the \"Ultra Combo\". The game also features combo breakers, finishing moves and stage fatalities, double energy bars, and a dance-music inspired techno soundtrack.",

      "description": "A young man named Crono is about to enjoy a carefree day: he plans to go to the Millennial Fair, where his friend Lucca intends to demonstrate her newest scientific invention: a teleporter. Upon his arrival Crono meets a young girl named Marle, who volunteers to be the first to test Lucca's new device. However, Marle's pendant affects the teleporter's mechanism in a mysterious way, and as a result she is teleported four hundred years into the past. Crono and Lucca quickly recreate the time portal and follow Marle. They find out that her unexpected appearance has created some confusion, and proceed to fix the error, which in turn leads to unforeseen consequences, eventually compelling the heroes to travel to different time periods and change the history of the world.\n\n<i>Chrono Trigger</i> is a Japanese-style role-playing game in which the player takes control of a party consisting of up to seven characters, developing the combat skills of its members and managing their equipment. There are no random encounters in the game: all the enemies are either visibly walking on the field maps and can be avoided by the player, or are waiting to ambush the party. No enemy encounters occur when the player navigates characters over the world map.\n\nThe game utilizes the ATB (active time battle) combat system from  Final Fantasy games as one of the combat style selections offered to the player in the beginning. The other selectable battle mechanic pauses combat whenever the player accesses the menu, effectively removing the real-time element and rendering the battles fully turn-based.\n\nAs the characters grow in power, their parameters increase, and they learn new \"techs\" - special powerful attacks and maneuvers which cost them magic points to use in battle. Techs may target a specific formation of enemies (e.g. a line) and can be used tactically depending on the enemies' positioning in combat. Characters may execute techs individually or perform double or triple techs, where each character contributes a tech which is combined with one or two others to unleash a powerful attack.\n\nOnce player-controlled characters acquire the ability to travel freely between time periods, the game's plot develops in a non-linear fashion. From that point on the player may opt to face the game's final adversary in combat and complete the story, or perform other plot-related quests. Depending on the moment of the story when the player decides to proceed to the final battle, the game may be concluded with thirteen different endings. The New Game+ option allows the player to start the game anew after having previously completed it, carrying over levels, techs, and equipment of the characters. \n\nThe PlayStation version features an anime-style introduction movie and cutscenes, a \"movie theater\" mode which allows the player to re-watch these movies and listen to the game's songs, as well as an unlockable bestiary, dungeon maps, and art gallery. The Nintendo DS version retains these changes and adds two new dungeons and a new possible ending that foreshadows the events of Chrono Cross.",

The once great continents have been drastically changed into thousands of tiny islands and various cities have washed into the oceans.  During this turmoil,  Zorgeuf the Great rushes to conquer the bewildered world along with a troop of commanders and declares the Earth Empire. The only hope to defeat him lies from without Earth, as the Colonial Forces send a command carrier from the major orbital base. With so many armies gone, the ground infantry unit has been replaced by the Metal Marine, a fifty foot armored robot that can be sent into battle for attack or defense. From their respective Command Center, each side in the conflict will need to direct the placement of facilities on the ground to defend against enemy attack, manage resources and successfully strike the enemy.\n\n<i>Metal Marines</i> is an isometric strategy game. Controlling one side of a conflict, the player must wage a campaign across several islands to defeat Zorgeuf and his lieutenants. The player controls logistics of the base to ensure that there are the necessary assets to wage war. On each map, the player places three underground command bases, if all of these are destroyed the battle is lost.  The player must manage the resources of their money to construct new buildings or upgrade existing facilities on the map. Different buildings include Energy Plants, Factories, Economic Centers, Radar systems, Anti-Aircraft missiles, fake buildings and fake HQ bases, mine fields, gun pods, missile launchers, metal marine hangers and even ICBMs.  At any time, the player may order an attack and choose which assets to fire at the opponent. Missiles, Metal Marines carriers and ICBMs all use different levels of fuel. Metal Marines once deployed in an area will automatically fire rifles at nearby targets or engage even closer targets in melee attacks. Gunpods, while stationary, will also fire on nearby enemies. Metal Marines are largely autonomous but can be manually controlled to a minor degree (directional) by the player.",

      "description": "A thousand years ago, the War of the Magi occurred. People remember it as one of the most horrible tragedies in history. Since the War of the Magi, magic has been all but forgotten, technology began to grow, and people returned to seemingly normal lives. The only true worry people have is the Empire, whose leaders are looking to revive the great force once known as \"magic\". \n\nThe Empire had heard word of the remains of a mystical being, known as \"Esper\", being found in the mining town of Narshe. Quickly, three soldiers were dispatched to find this Esper and bring it to the Emperor. One of the soldiers, a young girl, triggers a power in the Esper that initiates a dangerous series of events. The only ones who can help her are a rag-tag band of rebels and heroes, who offer their very hearts and souls to save the world from the mad plans of the Empire.\n\nThe sixth entry in the <i>Final Fantasy</i> series was dubbed <i>Final Fantasy III</i> in the West because three out of the five previous installments of the series had not been released there at the time. Similarly to its predecessors, this is a role-playing game where the player controls a party of characters, travelling between various locales in the world, fighting randomly appearing regular enemies and bosses, and making the characters stronger by improving their skills and getting better equipment for them. The game maintains the ATB (active time battle) system of the two previous installments in the series, spicing traditional turn-based combat engine with a real-time element. \n\nIn battle, every character can fight using weaponry and items, and each has a special combat skill as well. It is also possible for nearly every character to learn magic spells. By finding various Espers and equipping them on characters, the player can improve their parameters in different ways and choose the magic spells the characters should learn.\n\nUnlike most other Japanese RPGs, the game does not have a single main character. Rather, the player-controlled party can be considered the game's collective protagonist. The first part of the game develops linearly, with one of the characters playing a central role; however, during the second part the player is associated with a different character initially, exploring the game world, recruiting characters, and completing sub-quests in a non-linear fashion.\n\nPlayStation re-release of the game includes new FMV cutscenes, bestiary and artwork galleries. Game Boy Advance version and later Android, iOS and PC releases remove FMVs, but instead include two new bonus dungeons (the Dragons' Den and the Soul Shrine), new bosses, espers, weapons and gear, as well as many other minor additions and changes.",

      "description": "The hideous Red Falcon, thought to have been destroyed long ago by the Earth's greatest commandos, Mad Dog and Scorpion, has risen again, this time very angry and thirsty for revenge. His armies are marching through the cities, across the lands, with the intention of exterminating the human race like a bad case of fleas. Two commandos, Jimbo and Sully, have come forth now to defeat Red Falcon and save what remains of the world from his hideous plans.\n\n<i>The Alien War</i> is the third entry in the Contra series. Like its predecessors, it is a predominantly side-scrolling shooter with a heavy emphasis on action. The protagonist can carry two weapons (as opposed to one in the previous entries), and fire in eight directions when standing still. New abilities include climbing on walls, grabbing poles and navigating tanks. Parts of scenery can be destroyed.\n\nIn a few instances the protagonist will also participate in motorcycle changes. Two stages have a top-down view and are played differently than the side-scrolling levels, with more freedom of exploration and the necessity to complete mission objectives rather than simply advance in one direction and kill all the enemies.",

The game is set in the distant future, where your job is nothing less than Colony Administrator for a new settlement on some far-flung planet. Your aim is to provide the highest Quality of Life rating for the colonists. \n\nYou do so by ensuring that there is enough life support, power, housing, employment, police and entertainment to keep the citizens of your colony happy. Hindering your goal are random events such as solar eclipses (which can render your solar panels inactive) and also a different, hostile alien race that inhabits the planets in the many scenarios at offer. \n\nNot only do you have to be a good mayor but you also have to be a good general. Resources must not only be attributed to civilian research but into weapons research, intelligence and the building of tanks and spaceships, if you wish to survive long enough to see your colony flourish into a metropolis. As a rule, you will have built a strong colony before the aliens come, but the final push towards a QOL of 80% or higher can only be achieved once there is no outside threat.",

The versus mode is split-screen, each player trying to survive and eliminate more invaders than the opponent.\n\nThe Game Boy version has both one- and two-player modes using the usual Game Boy tones (black and grey). However, plugging the cart into a Super Game Boy allows playing the game in all four cabinet types of the SNES version. \n\nThe PC Engine (TurboGrafx) CD version offers an additional \"cosmic versus\" mode, where the background is composed of anime-style pictures of girls. They also appear in the \"omake mode\", which is a single-player variant with the same backgrounds.\n\nThe WonderSwan version doesn't offer all four cabinet types (only black & white) but keeps the versus mode.",

      "description": "The story of this game is based on <i>Episode IV: A New Hope</i>, the first of the original  Star Wars movie trilogy. The player initially controls the movie's main hero, Luke Skywalker, but two more controllable characters join later: the careless captain Han Solo and his Wookie side-kick, Chewbacca. The game generally follows the movie plot, allowing the player to experience some of the most important sequences, such as the search for Obi-Wan Kenobi, rescuing princess Leia, and the final confrontation against Death Star and its TIE Fighters, led by the mysterious Darth Vader.\n\nMost of the game levels follow traditional platform gameplay style. As Luke, Han, or Chewbacca, the player makes his way through the linear levels, fighting enemies, jumping over obstacles, and collecting power-ups. The power-ups include standard health-restoring items, upgrades for the blaster gun (up to five different upgrade levels), as well as special items that can be used for massive destruction of the enemies. Luke uses a weak blaster gun, but later gains access to a lightsaber, being able to fight enemies melee-style. Han and Chewbacca use stronger flame guns, but cannot upgrade to better weapons.\n\nSome of the levels are dedicated to familiar Star Wars vehicles (such as a land speeder). Controlling the vehicle from a third-person view, the player has to navigate it through the pseudo-3D environments, avoiding obstacles and shooting at enemies on the way.\n\nThe PlayStation ports of the SNES version have updated controller and display options, leaderboards, new save options, and Trophies.",

      "description": "After having defeated Mother Brain, the leader of the Space Pirates who wanted to use alien creatures known as Metroids to dominate the world, the bounty hunter Samus Aran took the fight to the Metroids' homeland and eradicated them. Only a single Metroid larva remained. Samus took it to a galactic research station, and scientists assured her that the powers of the larva can be harnessed to help people. However, everything goes wrong when a dragon kills the scientists, takes away the larva, and destroys the research facility. Samus follows the dragon to the planet of Zebes, where she fought Mother Brain before. She must explore the dangerous planet, stay alive, and figure out a way to retrieve the larva.\n\n<i>Super Metroid</i> is a platform game and a follow-up to Metroid II. Like the previous games in the series, it is not divided into separate levels; the planet Zebes is an open world which Samus traverses back and forth. This world is divided into rooms separated with doors which must be shot to be opened. Shooting is also used to open up secret passages, some of which contain nifty bonuses, but finding most of them is required to proceed in the game. \n\nThere are many items to find on the way, and each new item usually makes heretofore inaccessible areas available to Samus. The items include both weaponry (such as missiles, super missiles, or upgrades to Samus's standard laser gun), energy tanks that increase Samus' max health, and other gadgets (like a grappling hook that allows Samus to stick to the ceiling). \n\nThere are various enemies - alien fauna - lurking around planet Zebes. The enemies all respawn after re-entering a room, though Samus' increasing capabilities mean that they become easier to defeat as the player makes progress. After killing them, the enemies typically leave behind some health or ammo. ",

      "description": "<i>F-Zero</i> is a futuristic racing game, set in the year 2560. The player chooses one of the four available hovercars and then can race with other hovercars in one of the gameplay modes - \"Practice\" or \"Grand Prix\". \n\nIn \"Practice\" mode, the player chooses one track where he competes with one other hovercar to win the race (or there can be no rival at all, if you so wish). In \"Grand Prix\", the player must complete a series of races with several competitors. Each race consists of five laps. \n\nThe hovercar has a limited Power meter, which represents the machine's health and decreases when the hovercar collides with the track boundaries and other players. If power runs out, the hovercar explodes and the player loses the race. There are repair areas near the start line, which restore power to the player's hovercar if he drives into them. The tracks contain many more or less dangerous traps, such as icefields or landmines. \n\nCompleting a lap awards the player a \"Super Jet\" which can be activated at any time to give a short speed boost. The hovercar can keep up to three Super Jets and use them when necessary. \n\nCompleting a lap also gives points, which give the player a life when enough are accumulated. The player can lose a life in the Grand Prix mode if his hovercar explodes, if his hovercar somehow falls out of the track or if he ends up too far behind the other racers. ",

      "description": "In the year 199X, in the village of Onett, on the continent of Eagleland...\n\nYoung Ness was asleep one night when a loud crashing noise awoke him suddenly. As he rushes out of bed and up to a nearby hill, he encounters a strange meteor, carrying a single passenger: a mysterious insect-like being named Buzz Buzz. Buzz Buzz tells him that in the future, an evil alien being known as Giygas has conquered the world, and the only one who can stop him are four young kids: three boys and a girl. Ness, of course, is one of the chosen ones, and he must find the other three children: Paula, a young girl with remarkable psychic powers, Jeff, a mechanical genius, and Poo, the young Prince of Dahlaam. Together, these four friends have the power to defeat Giygas and save the world from his chaotic reign!\n\n<i>EarthBound</i> is a sequel to Mother. It is a top-down role-playing game in which the heroes travel around Eagleland and various other, exotic countries, trying to end Giygas' evil influence. \n\nOn the way, Ness and his friends will encounter a lot of enemies and battle them in turn-based combat. Unlike in the previous game, enemies are visibly walking on the screen. Each turn, each of the characters in the party can attack with their weapons, use a special ability (some characters have powerful psychic powers that can hurt enemies, heal comrades and more; some also have some other, unique special powers), use an item or try and escape. \n\nThe game features \"rolling HP meters\" - when a character is dealt damage, it's not all taken away from his HP right away, but instead his HP decreases slowly; if the combat is ended quickly, even a massively damaging attack can leave a character with only minor injuries. By winning battles, characters receive experience and thus become stronger. If the player-controlled characters are strong enough, weak enemies will escape from them instead of trying to attack; when chased down, they will be defeated instantly.\n\nSaving the game is done by finding a telephone and calling Ness' father. When the heroes defeat enemies, Ness' bank account receives money, which can be then retrieved from ATM machines throughout the game and spent in shops to buy better equipment or useful items. ",

      "description": "The sequel to  Super Star Wars is, as the name implies, based on <i>Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back</i>, the second of the original  Star Wars movie trilogy. The game features familiar locations and events from the film, such as the ice planet Hoth, the search for Yoda on the jungle planet Dagobah, and the fight against Darth Vader. Several locations are expanded, adding places and boss enemies that did not exist in the movie, and certain key events in the story are omitted or changed. \n\nAs in the previous game, the player is able to control three characters: Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Chewbacca. Unlike the first, each character has been given a distinct special move. Chewie spins a path of destruction through enemies, Han has grenades and a powerful slide, and Luke can switch to his lightsaber and block oncoming fire. Gameplay is very similar to the first game, mostly focusing on platforming elements. As before, there are Mode-7 vehicle levels, during which the player is able to pilot a snowspeeder against encroaching Imperial walkers, pilot the Millennium Falcon through the asteroid field, and break through Cloud City's defenses in Luke's X-Wing fighter. \n\nThe game's other major addition is the inclusion of a suite of Force powers for Luke. They are learned by collecting hidden orbs on the Dagobah level, and add a second special bar that depletes with each usage of a Force power. Power-ups include health items, weapon upgrades, screen-clearing detonators, and orbs that restore Luke's Force power. Passwords have also been added, and are given upon completion of each of the game's 25 stages.",

      "description": "<b>KABOOM!</b><br><br>Annie & Clint, two gunslingers, arrive at Carson City and get caught up in a gunfight. It's raining bullets and there are explosions everywhere. After an intense battle they enter the saloon where they dispose of every cowboy in sight while redecorating the interior. Our heroes flee the scene by climbing on the roof, but what's that sound? ... it's a <i>HUGE</i> robot!\r\n\r\n<i>Wild Guns</i> is a shooter with a western & Sci Fi theme. Gameplay is somewhat similar to the Time Crisis & House of the Dead games, with the exception that the game isn't played from a first-person perspective but from a third-person perspective. You control your on-screen character as well as the aiming crosshair (at the same time). Select either Clint (yes, inspired by Mr. Eastwood) or Annie and shoot down tons of enemies while dodging bullets and jumping over incoming rockets.\r\n\r\nAfter the Carson City level, the action continues in Desolation Canyon, an ammunition depot, a gold mine and a armored train (you can play these levels in any order). Finally there's a showdown with the big bad guy. Each of the 6 levels is divided into 3 sublevels. The 3rd one is always a boss-battle. During the game your standard weapon can be temporarily upgraded by collecting power-ups. If you want to create some serious mayhem you can detonate one of your bombs. Almost any object in the background can be destroyed.\r\n\r\n<i>Wild Guns</i> has a two-player co-op mode. There's also a shooting gallery mode in which you can't die; this one is all about scoring as many points as possible.",

Nightmare after nightmare haunt his subconsciousness, and it is up to you to get over each one, so that Bart will eventually wake up. \n\n<i>Bart's Nightmare</i> is an action game based on the TV cartoon show <i>The Simpsons</i>. The player navigates Bart through the side-scrolling overworld, collecting pages of his homework while avoiding various enemies modeled after characters from the show. For example, his sister Lisa would occasionally turn him into a frog, Principal Skinner may force him to wear a Sunday school uniform (slowing his movement), etc. Bart can repel enemies by blowing a bubble gum at them. \n\nOnce a homework page has been found, the player can step through colored doors and engage in various mini-games. These involve Bart transforming into a \"Bartzilla\", a giant monster out to destroy Springfield; swimming through Bart's own bloodstream, using air pumps to kill germs; being attacked by Itchy and Scratchy, the duo from the meta-fictional violent cartoon; flying over the city as the superhero Bartman, fighting boss enemies; and exploring the treacherous columns in the Temple of Maggie as Indiana Bart.",

The game was a multi system release so it fits the standard console jump/shoot/duck formula although it does add some unique twists such as wounding enemies so that they surrender and can be arrested.\n\nThe initial levels follow the plot of the movie with futuristic lawman Judge Dredd framed and sent to the Aspen penal colony from which he must escape and prove his innocence.  Following the fight at the top of the Statue of Liberty that ended the film, the game continues on with levels and characters inspired by the comic book culminating with a battle against the Dark Judges on Deadworld.",

Every weapon has also a massive 'smart' bomb feature, wiping out mostly everything on screen at once if invoked. There are also some R-Type style space shooter levels thrown in for good measurement. Very arcady with tons of action. Several boss monsters per level. Level progress is saved via password feature.",

The aim is to wipe out the enemy, which has gathered around the allied airspace of 'Area 88', in a series of military aircraft-based scenarios.\r\n You choose one of three unique pilots; Shin Kazama, Micky Schymon or Greg Gates, each with varying abilities at damage repair, weapon handling and flying skill, and engage the enemy over a series of challenging missions. The player starts out with the weakest plane, the F8E Crusader, which can only be armed with a very basic range weapons. But, through completing various missions, enough cash can be raised to purchase higher-quality aircraft. These superior planes are more agile, have improved resilience to damage and have a greater range of fire. Furthermore, the more advanced fighters can be armed with superior special weapons, such as napalm.\r\n The missions include attacks on sand bases, the nuclear submarine 'Seavet' and enemy supply camps, as well as seeing off groups of airborne 'bandits' who swarm-in on Area 88.\r\n The enemy is plentiful, and the pace is frantic. Shoot at everything on the screen that moves, and the allied forces might just come out on top......",

      "description": "<i>Spectre</i> is a 3D shooter where the player drives a little red car/tank and blasts away enemies.  The gameplay is similar to Battlezone, and obviously inspired by it.\n\nThere is a selection of three tanks, each with three values (speed; armor; and firepower) balanced out to match its name: Tough Guy is heavy on armor, but slow and not very powerful; Speedy is fast, but low armor; and Balanced combines both strengths, but decreased. A fourth tank allows the player to design a custom variant.\n\nEvery level consists of a large plane filled with enemy tanks, several psychedelic walls with odd images that often flicker or warp resembling an acid trip, and tacky 3D models like windmills.  The object of each level is to either destroy all the enemy tanks in the level, or to collect all the flags. Every level has a certain theme to it, anything from plain green to a colorful blinking eye or images of sand dunes are to be found on the walls, windmills and flags throughout the level.\n\nWith every passing level, enemy tanks grow smarter and their rates of fire increases.  Also in later levels, new, smarter, more powerful enemy tanks join the skirmish. The player has a limited amount of ammo, but driving over ammo deposits replenishes a small amount of ammunition, as well as driving over shield deposits grants additional shields. The three different views (first, third, and top-down) allow the player to incorporate additional strategies into the battles.\n\nThe game boasts having supposedly an infinite amount of levels, though anything after level 80 is almost instant death.  A high score table is also included.\n\nAn additional note-worthy feature of this game is the multi-player mode. Up to eight players are supported over IPX, or NetBios (or two via modem or serial port). The network option offers three Cyberspace Scenarios: <ol><li><b>Arena</b> - free-for-all battles, get one point for each opponent destroyed.</li><li><b>Flag Rally</b> - a match point given for collecting six flags, destroy someone to get any flags being carried.</li><li><b>Base Raid</b> - Akin to \"capture the flag\".  Two teams, two bases; get match point for destroying opponent base.</li></ol>The CD-ROM manual includes a \"Cyberpunk story\", to give background information on the game which consisted of a cyberjock named Hart who lived for the battles in the Arena.",

      "description": "After the Awakening, magic has been re-discovered, and human beings have accepted the existence of those they thought to be fantasy creatures. Mega-corporations and cyberworlds had to give space to elves and Native American shamans. Jake Armitage was a seemingly ordinary data courier, assassinated by a hit squad in the year 2050 in Seattle, Washington. Miraculously, his true story began after his death. A mysterious figure approached Jake and cast a spell on him; after that, he woke up in the morgue. \n\nJake doesn't know what happened to him, he doesn't even remember his own name. He is contacted by a shamanistic Dog totem with a cryptic message about his mission. Wandering through the large city where monorails, computers, and street gangs armed with automatic weapons co-exist with orcs, dwarves, and vampires, he begins to unravel the mystery, gradually learning about dangers awaiting him around every corner, and his own past.\n\n<i>Shadowrun</i> is based on the pen-and-paper role-playing game of the same name, more specifically on the novel <i>Never Deal with a Dragon</i> by Robert Charrette. It is entirely different from the Genesis adaptation of the same license. The game is a skill-based RPG with action-oriented combat. Most of the time Jake uses firearms; he can also learn magic spells, primarily with defensive and support capabilities. The player can hire \"deckers\", temporary party members who can aid Jake in battles, and to whom the player can assign basic commands or let them be controlled by the AI.\n\nKarma points are awarded to the player for successfully eliminating enemies. These act like experience points in other RPGs and can be manually distributed by the player. The player can increase the character's basic parameters (such as hit points or charisma), as well as have him master various skills. These include firearms, computers, negotiation, leadership, and others. \n\nJake can also use his cyberdeck to access cyberspace known as the Matrix, for plot-related purposes or in order to obtain money. Represented by an icon, Jake moves through the cyberspace, fighting programs that protect data from intruders. Jake's success in these endeavours largely depends on his computer skill.\n\nDialogue with non-playable characters plays an important role. Most quests involve Jake exploring various locations in Seattle and gathering information from people. Conversations are topic-based; often it is necessary to learn about a particular topic from a specific character and then choose it in a conversation with another one to obtain the necessary information.",

      "description": "The planet known to its inhabitants as Earth is composed out of two realms - the surface, or Lightside, and the underground world, or Darkside. Two cosmic forces, called God and Devil by the humans, were fighting each other fiercely until their final battle in Antarctica led to a catastrophe: the continents of the surface world submerged into the ocean, presumably eradicating all life on the Lightside.\n\nMeanwhile, the isolated underworld, consisting of frozen crystal mountains and lava rivers, continues to exist. A young boy named Ark grew up in Crysta, the only remaining village on the Darkside. One day, he and some other boys hear mysterious voices coming from beyond a door the village elder forbade them to open. Unable to resist their curiosity, the boys open the door, and Ark finds a box with a strange creature inside. By opening the box, Ark inadvertently causes all the villagers to be turned into stones. In order to bring them back to life, Ark has to find five towers within the dangerous Darkside and eventually restore life on the surface of the planet.\n\n<i>Terranigma</i> is an action role-playing game. Ark levels up after having completed an important quest or cleared out an area. He can attack enemies with various weapons, using different techniques: pierce, leap, dash, etc., resulting from the combination of three basic actions - attacking, running, and jumping. Special objects called Magirocks can be collected and converted into rings, which act as one-use items capable of casting magic spells.\n\nThe game is closely connected to and often regarded as the final part of a trilogy, the first two games being Soul Blazer and Illusion of Gaia.",

      "description": "In <i>Live a Live</i>, the player controls seven main characters and plays through seven different chapters set in seven different time periods: prehistoric age, old China, feudal Japan, American Old West, modern-day environment, near future on the Earth, and a sci-fi space scenario. \n\nThese stories appear to have no common points at first; each one has its own protagonists and goals: the prehistoric chapter is dedicated to love and friendship that existed before humans invented language; the Chinese chapter is a tale of an old master who must choose a perfect apprentice; the Japanese (Bakumatsu period) episode stars a ninja that infiltrates a warlord's castle; the Old West scenario is a classic tale of rivalry and revenge; modern-day story is a simple recounting of a fighting tournament; near future chapter deals with urban life and psychic abilities; finally, the space episode is a horror story in which a robot must investigate mysterious deaths of the crew members. \n\nThe player can choose to play the scenarios in any order, but must complete them all in order to unlock the eighth scenario, and eventually the final chapter - both of which explain the connections between the separate stories and deliver the grand finale.\n\nThe main gameplay system in <i>Live a Live</i> is that of a Japanese-style role-playing game with turn-based battles. Unlike most games of its kind, the battles take place on a single-screen field, on which the player can freely navigate the characters. Positioning the characters is crucial in many battles, as enemy attacks often have area effects; weapon range also plays a role in combat. \n\nThe chapters may vary drastically in gameplay. For example, the ninja chapter is mostly based on stealth; finding ways to avoid the enemies is preferable to engaging them in battles. The near future chapter features mind-reading and other puzzle-solving elements. The sci-fi chapter is unique gameplay-wise, having no battles at all, the gameplay focusing entirely on exploration and gradually solving the mystery.",

In this role-playing game the player controls two main pilots from the series, Noa Izumi and Isao Ota, as they complete their typical duties each day, helping to deal with rogue Labors (Mecha) and other such incidents.\n\nThe gameplay consists of three modes - a map of Japan, showing where assignments are located, the \"main\" screen, where the player controls the Labor from a top-down viewpoint and maneuvers it around the area of the crime, and the combat screen, for when you press the action button to attack a rogue Labor. From here it is possible to select one of various attacks; naturally, as the game goes on the pilots can learn new attacks. Unusually for an RPG there is also the option to just talk with the rogue Labor's pilot and try to convince them to back down - as a policeman, sometimes this is the only way forward.",

Again there are new levels and a new story but there are also a lot of new features.\r\n\r\nSuper Bomberman 3 adds in 5 player support using a multitap and the extra controller slot.  The \"revenge\" or \"miso bomber\" feature was introduced in this game.  That is when a player dies they can still throw bombs in from the sidelines in an attempt to swap places with a player that is still alive.  Many new powerups were added in this game including the Kangaroo which in addition to giving a player and extra hit allowed them to have some extra ablity including jumping, laying rows of bombs, and high speed running.\r\n\r\nPlayers are also not limited to the traditional Bomberman.  There is a wide selection of different characters that the player can choose from.",

Some of his equipment is still operational, and when the dog chews on it, they are both sent to the strange world of Evermore, and have to figure out how to get back.\n\n<i>Secret of Evermore</i> is an action RPG similar to Secret of Mana, with a few key changes.  Multiplayer is out.  Rather than three characters, there are just the two. The equivalent of magic is alchemy, where each effect requires several base ingredients which the player gathers as the game advances.",

Seeing this logo, the slugs determine that ours is a race made up of BONES and of ADVERTISING, two things the slugs simply hate. So they attack.\r\n\r\nWith the slug invasion in full swing, earth is quite simply outnumbered by the gooey slugs. It must recruit special super soldiers, Big Sky Troopers, armed with a special heavily armored suit to combat the menace. So urgent is the need for qualified Big Sky Troopers, that recruiting and rank are petty things. It is not unknown for example for a brand new trooper to start as a 21-star general in the army.\r\n\r\nOnce selected, it is up to your Big Sky Trooper, piloting a FIDO class starship, to engage the slugs in space and in planetfall and thwart their plans to destroy mythical galactic devices and conquer humanity.",

      "description": "Based on the first season of the TV series of the same name, your character is an officer of the UEO: The United Earth Oceans Organization. You begin the game inside a training simulation, which upon successful completion ensures your transfer to the crew of the seaQuest DSV where you will be called upon to perform the same duties.\n\nPrimarily, your function is to navigate the seaQuest Deep Submergence Vessel around the underwater map to various 'mission areas' where you will be called upon to use the on board vehicles to accomplish some task. Typical missions include salvage operations, rescue operations, disarmament of underwater explosives, termination of enemies and exploration. Damage of underwater property is deducted from your budget and completion of objectives adds to it. The money must be used to resupply weapons and buy additional vehicles. Underwater is a dangerous place.\n\nThe vehicles you have at your command include<ul><li>Speeder: A simple two-man vessel designed entirely for speed. It is also a combat vessel and may fire forwards, move up & down and change orientation between facing left and facing right</li>\n<li>Stinger: A prototype \"next generation\" attack vessel, this one-man sub allows you to orientate in any direction to fire your weapon accurately.</li>\n<li>Sea Crab: A slow vehicle used for excavation, mining, and rescue missions. It is the only vessel that can dock with other vessels and one of only two that can pick up undersea objects for transport. It comes with a water jet to clear debris and a retractable drill</li>\n<li>Sea Truck: Slow and bulky, this vessel may move up and down and change it's orientation between left and right. It's weapons are torpedoes and mines which may be dropped behind it. Furthermore it can also pick up undersea objects for transport</li>\n<li>Remote (HR) Probe: Small and agile, this vehicle contains only a very simple weapon. It's main purpose however is underwater welding and repair of objects. It can also activate switches</li>\n<li>Darwin - Intelligent Dolphin and seaQuest mascot: Darwin the Dolphin is perhaps the most agile of the vehicles, and may take off in bursts of speed. However Darwin has no weapons with which to defend himself and is very vulnerable. Darwin is able to get into tiny spaces that none of the other vehicles can reach. Darwin is able to activate switches.</li></ul>",

They belong to respectable families of warriors and healers, and excel in battles kills. One day, a letter from a neighbor town arrives. A strange disease has plagued the town and its inhabitants plead the healers of Clatos to help them. Milly's father decides to go, but he himself catches the disease. The young adventurers must save Milly's father and other people at all costs. But in the beginning of their journey, they discover a crashed space ship with people who belong to a much more advanced civilization. People from two different worlds must work together to solve the grand mystery.\n\n<i>Star Ocean</i> is a Japanese-style role-playing game that contains some stand-out features, such as Approval Rating: people like or dislike each other and their behavior towards Ratix and within the party might change depending on their feelings to him and your own actions. The combat is fast-paced, real-time: the player controls Ratix, while other party members are AI-controlled. It is possible to customize combat tactics by assigning roles to the protagonist's companions, and pause the combat at any time to make strategic decisions.",

Combat plays a heavy role in the game, as each car has a frontal weapon, such as a laser or missile, and a drop weapon, such as spikes or mines. As you complete races, you get more money to upgrade your car. The soundtrack features famous rock tracks such as \"Born to Be Wild, \"Bad to the Bone,\" \"The Peter Gunn Theme,\" \"Highway Star\" and \"Paranoid.\"\n\nThe game is very similar to RPM Racing. The later released PC version is an official release, but based on the SNES version incorporating the ZSNES emulator and limited to three tracks.",

Attacking (or being attacked by) a demon results in a short auto-battle sequence.\r\n\r\n\"Spiral Nemesis\" contains many classical Megaten elements, such as demon classification, Light/Dark and Law/Chaos alignment axis, etc.",

      "description": "In a future where fossil fuels are limited, major countries and forces of the world are at war with one another over territory. Alliances are made, forming two major sides: The Axis and The Federation.  The elite units in these wars are Assault Suits, man-piloted combat mechs called Assault Suits.  Jake is one such pilot, drafted into the Pacific States' Marine Corp under the Federation. During his training, the war has grown substantially and upon being assigned to a platoon, he is immediately thrown into combat.\n\n<i>Cybernator</i> is a side scrolling mech combat game and platform game. The player controls Jake as he moves his assault suit left and right on the battlefield. The assault suit can jump and use a jetpack for a short time to increase altitude. The assault suit begins with a Shot machine gun weapon that spreads out fire in front, and a Punch weapon for close melee. Additional weapons can be found during the course of the game and existing weapons improved by the gathering of \"P\" power-ups left by defeated enemies. \n\nEach level contains a variety of enemies and an end boss which must be destroyed to reach the next level. Some levels take place as horizontally scrolling shooters, in which the Assault suit can move up, down, left and right on the screen, but is constantly advancing towards new threats.\n\nThe PlayStation 2 version is not a straight port or emulation of the original SNES game. It has altered visuals and balance tweaks, as well as a brief new stage at the beginning.",

      "description": "One day a spaceship came down from the heavens and into the skies of Chinaland. It began broadcasting an image of peace. Soon Emperor Chin was holding a peace conference with the space ship's leader, Rub-A-Doc. Rub-A-Doc visited with some of the other places in the world before departing to the heavens and leaving the world. All seemed peaceful however there seems to be trouble starting up, strange monsters have been seen throughout Chinaland. Could the increase in monsters be somehow related to the recent visit from Rub-A-Doc? The ninja masters of Mount Edin, Jack and Ryu are sent to investigate...\n\n<i>Super Ninja Boy</i> is an action RPG for one or two players. In a two player game, each player controls either Jack or Ryu. In a one player game, only Jack appears. A second player may join at any time by visiting a convenience store.\n\nThe game contains familiar role-playing elements such as equipping differing kinds of weapons, equipment and gaining levels. The Ninja Boys are treated as a single entity and so these statistics are shared between Jack and Ryu with equal values. Battles with the enemy, either through random encounters or visible on the map is where the action starts. The characters enter a side-scrolling 'battle mode' where they may jump, fight, use their special techniques, items and spells, as well as activate various bonuses on the battlefield by breaking open the bonus boxes. A battle is over and experience points awarded when a pre-determined number of enemies are defeated or the Ninja Boys are defeated.\n\nWhen bosses are encountered, the gameplay changes to a turn-based system. Each turn, commands are given to Jack and Ryu, which include usage of special items and skills acquired during the game, who then perform actions based on those commands. The enemy's turn takes place the same way. The battle ends when one side of the conflict runs out of hitpoints.",

      "description": "<i>Demolition Man</i> is a game based on the 1993 movie by the same name. As with the movie, the game takes place in a dystopian Los Angeles, in 1996. John Spartan is the country\u00b4s most fearsome cop and hunts his nemesis, Simon Phoenix. However in doing so, he kills several innocent civilians and both characters are sentenced to cryostasis rehabilitation where they will be brainwashed for 30 years. However the brainwashing does not go as planned and upon waking up, Phoenix goes on a new crime spree. However in 30 years the world has also changed and Los Angeles has become San Angeles, a utopian and violence-free society. As a remnant of a more violent past, police officer John Spartan is once again sent to capture Phoenix.\n\n<i>Demolition Man</i> is a fast-paced platform game, with some levels taking place in an overhead perspective (similar to Smash TV). As John Spartan, the player will spend most of his time shooting endless waves of \"cryocons\" released upon the antiseptic world of the future. The standard weapon can be upgraded with a shotgun and magnum, both with limited ammo. Additionally, various types of grenades can be collected, which are thrown independently of the firearm. Simon Phoenix appears as a boss character at the end of every level that is directly tied in with the movie.\n\nThe Sega CD version of the game retains identical levels and gameplay, but adds digitized clips from the film to introduce levels and advance the plot.",

All is peaceful until suddenly a group known as \"Hackers\" appear and begin causing trouble. The Hackers and their robotic monsters take part in robberies, vandalism and destruction around the world. Dr. Akihabara leaves on a voyage determined to thwart the Hackers plan, leaving his son behind in Rococo. As strange things begin to happen in and around Rococo, Akihabara's son decides to investigate.  Idolizing his father and also wishing to grow up to be an inventor, he builds himself a robotic fighting machine and sets out on his Robotrek...\n\n<i>Robotrek</i> is a fantasy RPG with sci-fi and steampunk elements. Players take the role of Akihabara's son, living in his lab at Rococo. The majority of the game is an overhead view, traveling through areas, talking to people and using items. Early on in the game, the player will learn how to create a robot in the laboratory and will use this this robot in a side-view battle mode to combat monsters and gain experience. The robots can be upgraded and equipped with different types of weapons, both found and invented. The player can have a total of three different robots to choose to send to battle, which allows customization strategies for certain situations and enemies.\n\nAkihabara's son will also need to think up new inventions to thwart the challenges in front of him. He gets the ideas for these inventions from talking to people or witnessing events which cause a lightbulb to go off above his head. New items then become available for production in the lab. Also, many existing items including his own inventions can be combined properly in the lab to create new items and weapons. Items no longer wanted can often be turned into scrap which sometimes is also able to be combined.",

      "description": "The game is based on the Japanese manga and anime series <i>Sailor Moon</i>. It is set in the 30th century, in a futuristic city Crystal Tokyo. In this city lives a totally ordinary (at first) fourteen-year old girl Usagi. When she meets a magical cat named Luna, she finds out that she is in fact a princess sent to the future in order to fight the minions of Darkness. She discovers within herself the power to transform into the hero of darkness, Sailor Moon, meets other warriors who help her on her quest, and fights the evil Queen Beryl, hostile aliens, and other foes.\n\nThe events of this game take place shortly after <i>Bish\u014djo Senshi Sailor Moon S</i>, the fourth volume of the long-running series. A global peace is established in the universe, but lately suspicious things are happening. A strange meteorite is seen approaching the Earth. Street gangs and spies who work for a mysterious person called Apsu are seen in Crystal Tokyo. And the Mystic Silver Crystal, the Ginzuishou, which protects the city, is shaking! Usagi and her friends must now investigate the strange events and face the forces of Darkness once again.\n\nThe game is a Japanese-style RPG in Final Fantasy style (battles with your party to the right and the enemies to the left), with a battle system somewhat similar to that of Chrono Trigger: you must form a party out of several available characters, make them participate in battles together, and learn powerful combo attacks.",

      "description": "The magic world of Wozz, populated by magicians, alchemists, and other kinds of people - including simple town and village inhabitants - was a seemingly peaceful place, until one day, a poisonous rain started turning its inhabitants into monsters. The chief wizard realizes that the demon Balaam is trying to link the world of Wozz with the world of humans. Only a human hero can stop Balaam, and the wizard's teleporting magic brings... three young humans: the Japanese girl Reona Kitazato, and two boys: the American Shot Phoenix and the Chinese Chun Chingtao. Will those youngsters be able to stop Balaam?\n\nThe game is a traditional Japanese-style RPG similar to <i>Breath of Fire</i>: turn-based battles are viewed from an isometric perspective. You control all three characters as a party, but in the beginning of the game you choose one of them as the main character, and therefore will see the game from his/her perspective. In case the characters split up, you'll be able to control only the one you chose. ",

In desperation, the crew activate their jump drive without a destination... and end up flung across the galaxy to the galactic core. The Swordfish however is badly damaged with many casualties including the captain. Only 26 of the crew survive, and of them only six are qualified for combat: The commander, two soldiers, a mechanic and a doctor and six giant \"Module\" mechanized suits available for them. These survivors locate planet Farworld, apparently colonized by humans. There they discover the colony is under attack by a relentless mechanical aliens dubbed \"Berserkers\". The crew of the Swordfish must fight back against the Berserkers and explore the galaxy for some means to return home.\n\n<i>Cyber Knight</i> is an RPG with a science-fiction theme of being lost in an alien galaxy. The game takes place in a top-down view for movement on planets and areas, a side-view for combat sequences and a first person menu system when aboard the Swordfish starship. The Swordfish can travel between stars, scanning worlds for information. If the ship is able to land on a planet, three crew members piloting three Modules (giant robots) can be selected to debark and explore the planet. Many planets will have towns or people living on them which can be talked to in order to uncover information. Different quests are assigned in order to find the items necessary to progress. There is no system of currency or buying items. Instead, many defeated Berserkers leave behind \"NeoParts\", which can be brought back to the Swordfish's lab. Analysis of these Neo parts unlocks enhances statistics (endurance, agility, accuracy, etc) for the Modules and new weapons for them to carry. The six modules are unique in statistics, and also the six pilots each carry different skills.\n\nCombat takes place in turn-based combat on a 6x6 squares field. Seen from the side view, the three modules can be positioned in relation to enemies in order to attack, using a variety of melee and long-ranged weaponry. Ammunition is unlimited, but each module also carries a number of \"options\" that are consumable attacks. Each Module has two sets of hitpoints: one for the pilot and one for the module itself. If either one of these reaches zero, the module is destroyed. In order to heal, the party carries 10 each of repair kits and first aid kits, which must when not in combat. These kits, as well as options and defeated pilots or modules can be restored by returning to the Swordfish.",

      "description": "Following the events of the first Cyber Knight in the 24th century, the crew of the Swordfish have returned to Earth after defeating the mechanical \"Berzerkers\" far across space. However during their time away, the Earth Federation has been taken over by the ambitious General Forrest, who seeks to wage war on the independent systems and conquer them. Recognizing the potential weapons that could be made from the Berzerker science data, Forrest impounds the Swordfish and jails it's crew. The Berzerker data is used to create \"Overtech\" and bring to life \"Metalliforms\", self-replicating war machines. The Swordfish crew manages to escape, thanks to a mysterious agent \"CJ\", and are recruited into the resistance against the Earth Federation. Given a new spaceship, the Galvodirge, they must travel the galaxy to different human civilizations and devise a plan to stop Earth's attack.\n\n<i>Cyber Knight II</i> is an RPG with science-fiction themes. As in the first game, much of the game takes place in a top-down view for movement on planets and areas, a side-view for combat sequences and a first person menu system when aboard the Galvodirge starship. The Galvodirge can travel between stars, scanning worlds for information. If the ship is able to land on a planet, the crew can debark either on foot or using combat modules (mechs). Some areas are only accessible using modules and others (such as towns) do not allow the use of these war machines. Many planets will have towns or people living on them which can be talked to in order to uncover information. Different quests are assigned in order to find the items necessary to progress. There is no system of currency or buying items. Instead, many defeated enemies leave behind \"NeoParts\", which can be brought back to the Swordfish's lab. Analysis of these Neo parts unlocks enhances statistics (endurance, agility, accuracy, etc) for the Modules and new weapons for them to carry. \n\nThe crew are divided into a three person \"combat team\" and a three person \"support team\". If modules are used, they can be assigned from the ship's hanger. Unlike the first game, modules only perform a combat or a support role, and each is unique in statistics and the type of weaponry it can carry. When combat occurs on the main map, the support team will often deliver the first strike by firing missiles into the enemies. When searching facilities, caves or other locations, the support team is not available. Following either case, the combat team engages the enemy in turn-based combat on a 6x6 squares field. Seen from the side view, the three modules can be positioned in relation to enemies in order to attack, using a variety of melee and long-ranged weaponry. Ammunition is unlimited, but each module also carries a number of \"options\" that are consumable attacks. Each Module has two sets of hitpoints: one for the pilot and one for the module itself. If either one of these reaches zero, the module is destroyed. In order to heal, the party carries 10 each of repair kits and first aid kits, which must when not in combat. These kits, as well as options and defeated pilots or modules can be restored by returning to the Galvodirge.",

At Huffman Island, located in the the pacific ocean, wanzers are deployed by both the USN (United States of the New Continent) and the OCU (Oceana Community Union), who dispute ownership over the island.  One night, the OCU forces stage a covert recon mission on a facility located in Larcus, a USN-held territory and weapons facility. Lead by a soldier named Roid, this mission was entirely unofficial and violated the peace treaty. During the mission, USN forces lead by Commander Driscoll appeared and ambushed the OCU soldiers. During the combat, Roid's fiance, Karen is killed and the USN facility is blown up; placing the blame on the OCU. This became known as the \"Larcus Incident\" and the OCU denied all knowledge of it's soldiers actions. Ultimately it would be a leading cause to the second Huffman War. \n\nOne year later, the war is underway and Huffman island is under provisional control of the OCU, but with a weakened military unable to defend against USN attacks. The soldiers involved in the Larcus Incident have all been discharged and disgraced. Roid spends his time fighting as a gladiator in the Wanzer fighting arena before being approached by a mysterious man. Colonel Olson has found out about Roid's history and wants him to command a mercenary unit he is assembling on behalf of the OCU, dubbed \"Carrion Crow\". Convincing Roid that Driscoll is still out there on the island, Roid agrees.\n\n<i>Front Mission</i> is a turn-based strategy RPG played from an isometric perspective. Players progress in the story through large strategic battles involving multiple units and cutscenes between them. At certain places, usually towns, the player can visit multiple locations including bars and shops, and talk to people. Shops are also found to purchase new weaponry, parts and make repairs. In combat, each Wanzer robot is a separate unit that has a large variety of weapons and attack styles depending on what's equipped. Units get experience for defeating enemies and also for using various techniques. The more an attack is used, the more powerful it becomes.",

      "description": "<i>Super Saiya Densetsu</i> is based on the popular manga/anim\u00e9 series <i>Dragon Ball</i>. It follows the events described in the beginning of Dragon Ball Z, the second story block, which tells about the connection of the hero Son Goku with a powerful alien race, and new mighty foes from far away planets. The game starts just where the tale of Dragon Ball begins. Son Goku goes to meet his friends, but is stopped by a mysterious stranger named Raditz who tells Son Goku they are relatives. Raditz demands from him to destroy humanity, and as Son Goku refuses, takes his son Son Gohan hostage. To rescue his son, Son Goku joins forces with his arch-rival, the Demon King Piccolo, who obviously has his own plans concerning Raditz. And thus begins the story during which Son Goku will learn of his true origin...\n\nThe game is a RPG similar to the card-based Dragon Ball Z RPGs for NES. During battles, you choose cards from your card inventory, which determine the nature and the strength of your characters' attacks. You can also train your characters in training houses and upgrade their special Ki power. Unlike early DBZ RPGs, you can move around freely in <i>Super Saiya Densetsu</i>, and your movements are not determined by cards. You can also fly around the world and use your special Dragon Radar to discover location of magical Dragon Balls.",

      "description": "This is a follow-up to the game \"Lennus\", which is known outside of Japan as Paladin's Quest. The game is set in a world of Andell - a floating continent where ancient prophecies and highly advanced technology co-exist. A curse has fallen onto Andell - its four island, once united, are now separated, and are floating away from the heart of the continent, the temple of Andell. The sages of the temple summon a great hero named Farse, who must find a special magic orb for each one of the islands, which is the only way to re-unite them. Farse embarks on his journey, aided by three Terranos, the big-eared inhabitants of Andell.\n\nThis is a Japanese-style RPG where you control a party containing the main hero Farse and three Terranos you select out of the available five. You encounter random enemies and bosses and fight them in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. You can use special attacks and magical spells, which don't consume magic points, but take away a certain amount of your hit points. Instead of healing items, you have mini-bottles you can refill with potions in special places in towns. You can equip various magical artifacts which will allow you to use magic spells belonging to eight different elements.",

      "description": "\"Maten Densetsu\" is a RPG set in post-apocalyptic Japan, similar in style and in gameplay to  Shin Megami Tensei and other  Megaten games.\r\n\r\nYou find yourself in the middle of the Tokyo district Akihabara. But is this really Akihabara? The buildings have turned into ruins, and you wander around the deserted streets without any idea of how you could possibly be in such a place. A strange giant head appears in front of you, and defeats you in battle. When you wake up, you find out that Japan is floating in the air, and is attacked by a mysterious force that spawned countless demons who brought destruction to the cities. People are hiding among rubble and in underground passages. Some of them are fighting the demons, joining an organization called Self-Defense Forces. The hero's first objective is to find a way to his home district Shinjuku, where he will obtain more information about the power that threatens Japan, and discover mysterious artifacts from an unknown civilization, called <i>ooparts</i> (out-of-place artifacts).\r\n\r\nYou can play as either one of the five characters presented to you in the beginning of the game: Rage, Rai, Hokuto, Seigi, and Daigo, each one having his own initial strengths and weaknesses. The entire game plays from first-person perspective. You navigate a cursor over the city map and check out your radar device to find out places of interest. The claustrophobic, extremely complex first-person 3D dungeons have a distinct <i>Shin Megami Tensei</i> flair. The battles are random and turn-based. Your main character doesn't gain levels, but instead accumulates energy points which can be then distributed freely to raise his strength, mental power, defense, etc. Certain characters join your party later in the game, and there are also friendly demons who would join you if you choose a correct way of behavior when you encounter them.",

An evil organization known as the Grapplers terrorizes the world, destroying entire cities if they notice a sign of resistance. The elders of Mado City invited four famous monster hunters to defend the city against the Grapplers. One of the hunters, Maria, brought a friend with her - this friend is you, the hero of the game. But even the hunters can't withstand the Grapplers' assault. Their leader, the giant machine-like Ted Broiler, kills Maria. You are left on your own, and you decide to fight the Grapplers and to become a hunter yourself.\n\nThe game is a Japanese-style RPG with random encounters and turn-based combat viewed from third-person perspective, like in Final Fantasy games. There are two kinds of combat in the game: standard character-to-character combat, and vehicle battles. vehicles can be purchased, equipped, and modified just like the characters themselves. Various vehicles have different special attacks, and there are plenty of items to collect that will upgrade and repair your vehicles. As a hunter, you can also hunt down various giant monsters that populate the world, and kill them for a reward.",

      "description": "S.W.A.T Kats is a game based on the short lived cartoon series S.W.A.T Kats: Radical Squadron. The series would only last for 2 seasons but built a sort of cult following afterwards.\n\nThe Swat Kats are a duo of mechanics by day, but secretly also a group of superheroes defending their home, MegaKat city, from creatures and evil villians. Swat Kats is essentially a side-scrolling action game. You start off using T-Bone and Razor and guide them through 5 different worlds of action packed excitement. Game levels are based on different episodes of the show. As you progress through the game you can increase your weapon levels and gain new weapons. Mode 7 graphics are featured in some parts of the game. A unique feature to the game is the ability to start on different levels.",

As well as the story mode, the player can play individual fights, either with 1 or 2 players, although one human player must always be Shaq.

      "description": "The year is 2064, when the great solar power satellite, ATLAS is overshadowed by the invention of fusion power. The government alliance that had supported the building of ATLAS now find themselves facing economic crisis as the balance of power shifts. In this world of conflict and change, the Walking Panzer, or Wanzer, (a form of mecha) becomes the standard armored unit for wars and petty battles across the globe. For the small nation of Bergen, a coup d'etat is underway, staged by Colonel Ark. Seeking to establish complete control over the government and the NORAD units stationed there, Ark's first step involves the capture of President Orwen. Tipped off to the rebellion, Orwen seeks to flee from Bergen, looking for safe passage out of the seaport of Port Ertothal. A young Wanzer pilot, Albert Grabner, is assigned escort duty to the president by loyal elements of the army stationed there...\n\n<i>Gun Hazard</i> is a side-scrolling shooter with strong RPG elements, and a spin-off of the Front Mission series. Gameplay is more than a little similar to Cybernator or Metal Warriors. The player moves between different stages on an area map. Once inside a stage, the player controls Albert and his wanzer as it moves left, right across the screen. The wanzer is able to jump, and attack with a primary and a special weapon. At any time during a stage, Albert can eject from his heavily armed wanzer to explore. Although vulnerable when outside, Albert is able to reach areas the wanzer cannot, in addition to being a smaller target and being able to jetpack indefinitely.\n\nMoney and experience are earned through the completion of mission objectives as well as the kill count of enemy wanzers. Additionally, Albert can recruit other characters through the normal course of the story, some of whom can be designated to support roles. These support characters when set can provide a variety of different cover fire abilities for Albert during his missions. They too gain experience and levels. Different weapons and armor can be found or bought. Essential components include the Booster ability which allows the wanzer to hover and increase its jumps, as well as the Dash ability which allows quick left-right movement by the wanzer. ",

As the missions and levels progress he finds clues which lead him inevitably on to the next level.\n\nThe main character has a very large selection of combat moves, and also has great agility and the ability to climb walls using his wrist-spikes.  Bonus pickups are provided in the level maps.  Many of them are hidden very thoroughly which invites the player to use Wolverine's agility and climbing abilities to explore every corner. The levels include a secret lab, a ninja training camp, a hallucinogenic world, and others.\n",

Freedom Forces to get into their Turrican Assault Suits and drive back the forces of \"The Machine\".\r\n\r\nSimilar to it's predecessors, Super Turican features large levels that are crammed with secrets and can be explored freely and in any direction. To get rid of the numerous enemies, Turrican can use three upgradeable shots: A spreadshot, a powerful laser and a rebound that bounces off of walls. Additionally, there is a Freeze-Beam that can be used to temporarily freeze enemies. It is fully rotatable, and therefor also a great help in discovering secret capsules. These capsules contain powerups and can often be used to reach secret areas. Last but not least, Turrican has the ability to transform into an energy wheel (as long as he has enough special energy), which enables him to lay mines and even makes him invincible.\r\n",

      "description": "Years have passed since prince Selios, the hero of the first game, defeated the demon god Agunija in the ultimate battle. Peace returned to the land of Iseruhasa. Selios married his sweetheart Dina, and they had a child, whom they gave the name Atlas. At the age of fifteen, Atlas was already a strong warrior, thanks to the lessons of his teacher Lowel. Everything seemed peaceful in the country, until two warriors spotted strange creatures near the capital city. Those were... men in space suits! Of course, the warriors could not have known this and believed them to be monsters. Do the mysterious strangers have peaceful intentions, or are they a new threat to the kingdom?\n\nThe second <i>Dragon Slayer</i> is very similar to the first game, graphically and gameplay-wise. The only major difference is the fact that the enemies are now completely visible on screen before battles, so that the player can avoid fighting them if he wants to. Otherwise, it is a traditional Japanese RPG with turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. The Genesis version has once again updated graphics.",

      "description": "There was once a great scientist and inventor named Gepetto, who lived on an island farm together with his creations, his robotic helper, the pixie Tinker, and his pet animals. His greatest creation was an artificial boy named Pino. No, he was not carved from wood, but looked just like a real boy - only he could turn his head 360 degrees. But Gepetto was arrested for an unknown reason. The boy Pino looks like a real boy, but he was completed just a few moments ago, and he knows absolutely nothing. All he can do is wander aimlessly, poking objects and turning his head. It is up to the player to make Pino a real man!\n\n<i>Wonder Project J: Kikai no Sh\u014dnen Pino</i> is a simulation game with role-playing elements. The player must use the robotic pixie Tinker to educate Pino. It is possible to move Tinker around, examining objects and collecting them in an adventure-like fashion. Pino will automatically follow her to the direction she is facing, but will continue walking until the player stops him. He will also pick objects and make his own \"experiments\" with them. The goal is to train Pino in various disciplines. His stats can be raised in a RPG style: reading books increases his intelligence, throwing a ball increases his dexterity, and so on. By praising or scolding Pino, the player will gradually make him understand what should be done and what shouldn't.",

Naturally, a dictator named General Akhboob took control of the beleagured nation and began creating an army of radioactive mutants. With a virtually impenetrable stronghold, a bunch of hostages, and a legion of mutants under his command, the evil despot will stop at nothing but world domination. Only two men have the courage and idealistic naivete to take on Akhboob and his forces: Captain Carnage and Major Mayhem, also known as the Doomsday Squad.\n\nAs Captain Carnage or Major Mayhem, it is up to you or you and a friend (in simultaneous action) to rescue the hostages while shooting hundreds of mutants bent on your destruction. As you walk and run forward, backward, left, right, and diagonally through 20 battlezones of nonstop action, you'll always have your machine gun by your side. Additional weapons which you can find along the way include grenade launchers, rocket launchers, plasma machine guns, flame throwers, spray-fire rifles, defensive blades, and an assortment of bombs.",

To get rid of all the enemies, several different weapons can be used, most of which are already familiar to players from previous installments of the series: a Laser, a Spread-shot, and a(improved) Rebound. There is also the option to go\r\ninto \"wheel-mode\" for a limited time to become invincible, lay mines and shoot rockets. The Flamethrower is new to the series as well as the Rope, which can be used to climb walls, cling to platforms or pick up out-of-reach items. Much like in side-scrolling shooters, you can now pick up homing missiles as secondary weapons. The biggest difference to previous Turrican-games however, is the fact that in Super Turrican 2 almost half of the levels are strictly linear and don't feature any large secret areas that have become somewhat of a trademark of the series.",

      "description": "Based on the cartoon of the same name, <i>Biker Mice From Mars</i> is a racing game very similar to Rock 'n Roll Racing. Races are shown from an isometric perspective and you can choose between six different drivers that differ in acceleration, top speed and grip. During the races, you can use weapons such as mines or missiles to slow down your opponents and pick up random bonuses ranging from money to making you temporarily invincible. After each race, you will receive money that can be spent on better tires, armor, engines or weapons. There's also a two-player mode that lets you play the main race with a friend or compete in a one on one race.",

But his archenemy, the demonic Skull Master, has recently locked all the portals Max was using for inter-dimensional travel. However, the Skull Master has kept some of the portals for himself, keeping there some of his destructive weapons. It's time to destroy those weapons and to stop Skull Master!\n\nThis is a platform game in which you control Max himself or one of his two side-kicks (that doesn't influence the gameplay). You travel through several different worlds. Your goal is to find Skull Master's weapons, which are scattered around the level, and to destroy them. The levels are timed, and there are also plenty of enemies who will disturb you on your way to the goal. ",
