There are eight versions of each vehicle; two 97 models, two 98 models, two 99 models, and two 2000 models. Each model varies in performance, the slowest being the 97 models and the fastest being the 2000 models.\n\nThe player can compete in single-player mode where he gets to choose the cars and tracks freely if unlocked in the second game mode, the career mode, which is more ambitious. Here the player takes the role of a low ranked driver, starting with slower cars and paving his way to the top. Also in the career mode it is possible to upgrade the tires, suspension, transmission, brakes, and engine of the car, as well as reduce its weight. ",

      "description": "A futuristic racing game with hover cars, in the same line as Wipeout, using a modified version of the Magic Carpet 2 engine.\n\nGameplay takes a straightforward approach, with the directional keys controlling the steering and throttle, and three keys to fire the minigun, missiles or charge the booster. While the minigun has unlimited ammo, both fuel, armour and missiles must be replenished by passing through some marked areas or picking up powerups in the track or by left destroyed opponents. While the vehicles float on the track they are still influenced by the ground material: they slow down on dirt and even more on water. \nEach track has a number of shortcuts or alternate routes that offer powerups, and some tracks feature gates and ramps that open or close randomly.\n\nIncludes 9 tracks and several game modes (for Saturn owners and PC players with the 1.2 patch installed) such as single race mode (with option to change the number of laps), a Championship mode, Split Screen, Clone Race (beating the ghost of the best race time), Death Match (Where instead of finishing first what matters is finish alive and with the most kills) and Hot Seat, where up to eight players can compete in the same race by taking turns, with the computer taking control of the players' vehicles waiting for their turn. There are six hover cars to choose from: the fast Flexiwing and Outrider, the balanced KD-1 Speeder and Vampyr and the slow but armed to the teeth Berserker and Jugga. In addition to the natural capacity of each, their Minigun, Missle and Booster capacities can be upgraded by picking up powerups during the race. There are Eight teams to choose from, which change the colour of the vehicle: Mad Medicine (white), Bullfrog (aqua green), Storm Riders (purple), Fire Phreaks (orange), DethFest (blue), Foo Fighters (yellow), Gorehounds (red) and Assassins Anonymous (black).",

There are other bikes on the road, but beating this is not important, so they can be thought of as moving obstacles. Each continent is a different difficulty level: Africa is beginner, Asia is junior, the Americas are senior, and Europe is expert.  \n\nThis is a very simple and straightforward game, viewed from behind the bike in 2D (so the screen does not tilt with the bike). The right/left controls are steering, and up/down are gear changes. Your cycle is always moving, and your speed strictly depends on the gear you are in, although contact or running off the road slows the bike down.\n\nThe Sega Genesis version features \"Original mode\" in which the player participates in racing tournaments, hires mechanics, upgrades his bike. This mode uses passwords allowing players to continue a previously played game. ",

      "description": "<i>Crazy Taxi</i> is an arcade-like racer where the player takes the role of a taxi driver who weaves his way through crowded streets, across sidewalks and even under water, in a wild and frantic race to deliver passengers on time. The courses are largely set inside cities crowded with general traffic and pedestrians (which can't be run over, they dive away). The main goal is to bring as many customers as possible to their destination in time. Available customers are marked through circles and the colour represents the distance and the fare they offer. Green means long rides with plenty of money, and red ones are very short. \n\nIn the main Arcade mode there is a timer that quickly runs down. It can be replenished by picking up customers. While driving reckless maneuvers are encouraged. Players can disregard all traffic rules and customers give extra tips for speedy and dangerous driving, but these can only be cashed when the customer arrives at his destination in time. By the same token the reward at the end of a ride is based on the amount of time left, as each customer also has a personal timer. The city is filled with slopes and jumps, and the game uses a very loose driving model. No damage can be done to the car, so driving as fast as possible is encouraged. While driving players can toy with the gears to perform two special tricks: a crazy drift and a crazy boost to speed up more quickly.\n\nNext to the Arcade mode there is an Original mode, and Crazy Box where specific goals need to be met on closed down courses. In the regular modes it is possible to disregard the usual timer and play for a fixed amount of minutes. At the end of the race the player is rewarded with a license, either D, C, B or A, with S for an outstanding performance. Next to the interactive courses from the arcade version there is a new course for home consoles. There are four cabs and drivers to choose from. The cars have different statistics and the drivers different attitudes while racing. The game has a soundtrack featuring The Offspring and Bad Religion (not for the Xbox 360 version).",

      "description": "Developed exclusively for the Sony Playstation, this fourth title in the <i>Ridge Racer</i> series features new visuals, powered by goraud-shaded polygons, giving each car and track a more refined appearance, while keeping the same arcade gameplay popularized by the first game of the series.\n\nWhile it includes the usual time attack and a new split-screen versus mode, the focus of the game is the <i>Real Racing Roots '99</i>, Ridge City's three heat, seven race championship, with the grand finale in a speedway during New Year's Eve.\n\nThe player starts by choosing one of the four teams available (from easiest to harder): <i>Micro Mouse Mappy</i>, directed by the lovely Sophie Chevalier who hopes to win the first title in many years for the French team to honour her ill grandfather, <i>Pac Racing Team</i>, a recently created Japanese team directed by Shinji Yazaki who expects to create an immediate splash in the Ridge City racing scene, from Italy the RRR champions <i>Racing Team Solvalou</i>, with the demanding Enki Gilbert at the helm, and the American team <i>Dig Racing Team</i>, who has fallen into financial difficulties, with team director Robert Chrisman struggling to provide the driver with a car capable of out-handling opponents.\n\nAfter picking a team, the player can choose one of the four car makers available: <i>Lizard</i> and <i>Assoluto</i> keep the old RR tradition of cars drifting wildly on corners, but <i>Age Solo</i> and <i>Terrazi</i> offer a new experience with their \"Grip\" cars that require more breaking and careful trajectories, but are easier to control during turns.\n\nThe player earns (and so, unlocks for free play) cars by completing races; however, final placement defines how good the car will be. By scraping through the first two heats (the Final GP accepts nothing but a victory), sponsors will be unwilling to invest in the team and instead of a new car, the mechanics will only upgrade the current vehicle. But winning all races allows the driver to reach the <i>Shooting Hoops</i> speedway with the fastest car. By combining all qualifying placements, 320 cars are waiting to be unlocked.\n\n<i>R4 Ridge Racer Type 4</i> also includes an extra disk, featuring the original Ridge Racer in higher resolution. For a time, the game was also sold as a bundle along Namco's innovative Jogcon controller.",

It sure isn't like your typical racer -- Bomberman Fantasy Race has players riding on big loping kangaroos and giant blue rabbitty-dinos as they hop and dash to the finish line with long, bounding gaits. It's a wild race, made even wilder with all the bombs and action of Bomberman. Two can challenge each other to a blast around the track, or run for it on your own in the single-player mode. Buy new bombs and better ride-a-long animals to give the competition something to blow its top over!\r\n",

Each team's hovercraft racer has different ratings in speed, acceleration and turning. In addition to high-speed racing, there is also shooting in the game, with different weapon pickups like rockets and mines available, useful for slowing one's opponents down. Shields can also be picked up and can block the weapons' effects.\n\nThere are championship, single race and time trial modes. Winning the championship in the regular Venom class unlocks the Rapier class, where the craft are faster and the tracks have slightly different looks.\n\nThere is also a two-player mode where two opponents can race and shoot at each other.",

The game has a very dark and gothic theme to it, with the music to back it up. Detailed graphics, day/night cycle, particle effects, and a constant 60 frames per second.  The game also boasts a multiplayer mode, with 1-4 multiplayers, over ten arenas (some specific to multiplayer), and a cooperative mode, so instead of fighting each other, you can work together. The game's soundtrack consists of techno/gothic music, with some industrial, and acoustic guitar bits, especially the ending credits, <i>Paint It Black</i>.",

      "description": "Every year, a mysterious man named Calypso sends e-mails to renowned drivers, inviting them to compete in a tournament called Twisted Metal. The conditions of the tournament are anything but ordinary: opponents fight each other in armored vehicles with mounted weapons. The winner receives an audience with Calypso, and is granted a single wish - a wish without limits, be it money, power, or even our reality itself. In 2005, the annual tournament is held again in Los Angeles, and twelve drivers, each with his own agenda, have come to compete to death.\n\n<i>Twisted Metal</i> is a vehicular combat game. The player selects one of the twelve available drivers and takes part in the competition. In the one-player story mode, the player must progress through six combat stages; all the opponents must be destroyed in order to win the race. In the two-player co-op mode, players choose a battlefield and control two cars in an attempt to get rid of the competition.\n\nAll the vehicles are equipped with two mounted machine guns; though relatively weak, they have unlimited ammunition. Other weapons can be picked up by driving over them during the races. These include fire and homing missiles, land mines, tire spikes, and others. Each participant has a life bar, which can be replenished by entering a specific area on the stage.",

When you stumble across your first challenger and are invited to join Midnight Club.  Call other members on your cell phone and challenge them to race across the city.  Winner gets the losers car.\r\n\r\nMost challengers have a better set of wheels than you do so strategy and cunning play a key role if you are going to move up the ladder.  Both Manhattan and London are accurately modeled.  Race through Madison Square Garden.  Jump on to the deck of the Intrepid.  Barrel down the West Side Highway through Battery Park City and up F.D.R.\r\n\r\nIn addition to career mode, you can play in Capture the Flag or just plain race in multiplayer mode.  Angel used the Smuggler's Run engine so the game play, feel and mechanics are very similar.",

      "description": "After leaving San Andreas and going on a crime spree throughout the country, Claude Speed and Catalina head to Liberty City for a life of crime.  During a bank heist, Claude is betrayed by Catalina and her Colombian friend Miguel, and he is shot by her just as they are leaving the scene of the crime.  Claude fully recovers....in a prison cell. However, while being transported to a prison, Colombians ambush the prison van for an inmate riding with Claude.  Claude and his friend, 8-Ball, escape in the process.  Now it is time for revenge.  Claude slowly rises through the ranks of the local gangs, gaining trust from local mob bosses and turning on others.  Claude gains influence, trust, and most importantly, money along the way.  It is time for Claude to rise from the dead and get revenge for what Catalina has done.\n\n<i>Grand Theft Auto III</i> is similar in its concept to its predecessors: the player is cast in the role of a vicious (albeit novice) criminal, who performs tasks for crime lords and gradually raises his rank in the criminal world. Driving is the main gameplay element in the game, though the player can also fully explore the city on foot. For the first time in the series, the entire game is rendered in 3D. Different camera angles are available for driving, and free camera rotation is available when on foot. \n\nAs opposed to the previous games, Liberty City is the only city the player can explore in the game. The game puts more emphasis on the story, displaying cutscenes before each mission. In order to complete the game it is necessary to perform all the main story missions; however, the player often has the choice between several missions at a given moment. The missions include chases, races, short third-person shooter sequences, as well as various mini-game-like activities. Outside of the missions, the player is free to explore the city and undertake sub-missions, for example working as a taxi driver, delivering sick people to the hospital in an ambulance car, etc. ",

      "description": "Presenting a new sequal to the hit racing game, \"Star Wars: Episode 1 - Racer\":  \"Star Wars: Racer Revenge\"!  Here's what LucasArts says about it:\r\n\r\nIt has been eight years since the first spectacular Podracing showdown between Sebulba and the young Anakin Skywalker. Seeking payback for his humiliating loss, Sebulba has a new beefed-up Podracer and lust for revenge. But it's not going to be easy: Anakin has grown into a boldly skilled Podracer pilot. Thus the stage is set for Star Wars\u00ae Racer Revenge\u2019, bringing newer, faster, and even more dangerous Podracing to the galaxy-taking you on a one-way ride to ultimate victory. Jockey for position with a tangle of Podracing opponents or leave the pack behind at intense, nerve-jangling, planet-scorching simulated speeds of up to 600 mph. Crash and bash competitors into oblivion as you take them out of the race for good. \r\nGet down and dirty against 16+ of the most aggressive Podracers in the galaxy and smash your opponents into twisted wreckage\r\n\r\n\r\nFeel the heat and roar of a horde of opponents on your tail--the turbo-charged Podracer AI means you're never on the track alone\r\n\r\n\r\nNew, never-before-seen characters and Podracers, plus a few of your old favorites\r\n\r\n\r\nRace to the finish in the Boonta Eve Classic or earn your place in the winner's circle on 13 devilishly challenging courses on four new planets, plus Tatooine\r\n\r\n\r\nMultiple game modes include practice, single play, tournament, time trials and versus\r\n\r\n\r\nDeveloped by Rainbow Studios, makers of the hit games Motocross Madness and ATV Off-Road Fury \r\n",

      "description": "Tommy Vercetti is a gangster who just got off a fifteen year prison sentence for not squealing on his friends.  Because he didn't rat out his \"family\", Tommy's sent to work with Sonny Forelli, his old boss. Sonny gives him an easy drug job, but everything goes wrong, and Tommy loses everything.  Upon returning to Sonny, he gets mad and wants his money back. Unfortunately, everybody in Vice City, from gangsters and Cubans to bikers and politicians are in his way, and it's up to Tommy to clear a path.\n\n<i>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City</i> offers the same free-roaming driving and action gameplay style as its predecessor, but in a new setting based on the city of Miami. The game includes all the features of the previous installment and builds upon them. There are new cars in the game, reminiscent of typical vehicles from the 1980's. Some cars are earlier models of the vehicles from <i>GTA III</i>. A few missions also involve the protagonist navigating a boat.\n\nNew to this installment is the ability to drive motorcycles. Tommy can drive a variety of two-wheeled vehicles, from huge Harley-esque bikes to dirt bikes to a standard motorcycle. Flying is also a bigger part of the game, as the player can fly small planes and helicopters, traveling from area to area, landing on helipads on top of towering skyscrapers.\n\nFirearms are for the most part the same as in <i>GTA III</i>, and melee weapons have been added to the protagonist's arsenal. Tommy can use riot batons, crowbars, and a few others. Activities outside of the missions (driving taxis, delivering sick people to hospitals, firefighting and playing a vigilante policeman) are available as well.\n\nTo effectively capture the mood of the 1980s, the soundtrack has been altered to fit the time period. Players will listen to an estimated nine hours of music (nearly three times the amount featured in the previous game) across ten radio stations. The eclectic mix features such noteworthy titles as <i>I Ran</i> by Flock of Seagulls, <i>The Message</i> by Grandmaster Flash, <i>You've Got Another Thing Coming</i> by Judas Priest, and <i>Out of Touch</i> by Hall & Oates.",

There are some obstacles, like the whirlwind or oil-slicks, which should keep you from going around the track too easily. But <i>Championship Sprint</i> is not only an update with 8 new tracks. The main improvement is a complete track editor. With this you have the freedom to construct unlimited tracks, with all kind of obstacles and you even can set options like number of laps and number of players.",

And if you have a car that can race the distance, there's money involved too.\r\n\r\nThis is the premise behind Midnight Club II, in which you must work your way up the ranks of illegal street racing by challenging and defeating the best over three cities.\r\n\r\nEach race occurs in a different area of the city, and all you have to do to get started is flash your lights at the person you wish to drag. Then follow the map for the track route and go hell for leather. Further along, shortcuts will also come into play, giving you an advantage in getting to the finish first.\r\n\r\nEach race you win racks up cash, which goes towards new and much faster cars for the more difficult challenges. You'll also get the chance to go two wheels with a selection of highly mobile bikes.\r\n\r\nMultiplayer modes include the usual all-on-all race mode, and capture the flag, in which you must race to the opposing flag somewhere in the city and return it to your destination.",

As you race through the treacherous and ever changing roadways, the numerous enemy cars will be trying to bump you off the road. You need to make sure you bump the cars out of the way before you get bumped and crash into the sides yourself! Your car also has the ability to jump quite high if you have enough speed. This is useful to jump over enemy cars if there are too many in the way, and must also be used to jump gaps in the roadway and other highway obstacles. As the levels progress, the road becomes narrower with more obstacles in the way, and the other cars increase in number and in aggressiveness.",

      "description": "<i>Jak II</i> is a 3D action platform game and sequel to Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy. After completing their quest from the original title, Jak and Daxter are shot into another time and space and the future of their planet, and everything is different. The two are split up, with Jak thrown into jail by Baron Praxis, the ruler of Haven City. For two years Jak is experimented on with dark Eco, turning him into an almost Hulk-like character, mean and filled with rage. \n\nRescued by Daxter, the two must set off and find a way to shut down the operation and get revenge for Jak's uncontrollable change. Along the way they will meet new friends and deadly enemies (known as Metal Heads), but at least now Jak has something special on his side: weapons, and lots of them. Including a shotgun, sniper rifle, machine gun and a powerful blast weapon. Gameplay includes platforming, vehicle racing, rescue missions, hover boarding, playing mini games and shooting at various enemies (including boss fights).",

      "description": "In the future, on the planet Hillys, the population suffers from constant attacks from the alien DomZ. The situation is gradually getting worse, as the rate of DomZ kidnapings increase. The Alpha Section forces, who are in charge of protecting citizens, seem to be completely ineffective, not even fighting the DomZ. In the midst of this situation, the secretive organization IRIS alleges that the Alpha Section is involved in a massive government conspiracy, and seeks to expose the truth through journalism.\n\nThe player controls a young reporter and photographer named Jade with her companions Pey'j and Double H. After experiencing first-hand a DomZ attack, she is contacted by IRIS, who recruit her as an action reporter. Jade is now tasked with infiltrating the Alpha Section, exposing the government conspiracy, and ultimately finding the truth for herself.\n\n<i>Beyond Good & Evil</i> is an action game with diverse gameplay. Much of the game is based on stealth and puzzles, but there are sequences of racing, shooting, combat, and platform action. Jade fights with her staff and also uses various abilities to execute long-ranged attacks and solve puzzles. Many of the puzzles require switching between the characters and using their special abilities; often it is necessary to coordinate the actions of two characters to achieve precise co-operation that leads to a puzzle's solution. Beside hostile areas with puzzles and enemies, there is also a city and other friendly areas to explore, where various items and gadgets can (and sometimes must) be bought. There are several mini-games and even an online ranking system (used by entering codes online after they are assigned in-game when the game is saved). ",

      "description": "A chaotic, and bouncy rally racing game.  One of the aspects of this game that set it aside from other games at this time was the variety of the terrain.  Not only is it off-road, but the course is filled with jumps, dips, hairpins, and off camber turns.   Consequently, it is very common for the car to flip upside down.  By pressing the shoulder buttons, the player can rock the car left or right.  To get back on the tires, the user must time the rocking of the car to flip it back upright.  \r\n\r\nAny of the course can be raced forwards or backwards, and there is a season mode as well as the single race mode.  In order to increase the chaos, there is a suicide-mode where you race the course in the opposite direction of the other cars.  Up to 4 players can play the game in split screen mode.  Tracks include a tight Stadium course, an abandoned mine, jungle, and desert.  \r\n\r\nOne trick to increase performance is that the buttons that rock the car upright, can also be used to prevent flipping in tight corners. Mud, dirt, snow, and water are kicked up behind the car to add some graphical flair.  The cars in the game are not licensed vehicles.\r\n",

      "description": "The events of the game take place in the early 1990's. The player takes control of Carl Johnson (C.J.), who had moved to Liberty City in order to distance itself from his past as a member of a gang in his home city, San Andreas. But the past catches up with him in a way he had not imagined: he finds out that his mother was killed by a rival gang. He goes back to San Andreas to attend her funeral. Realizing how corrupted local police is, seeing how his relatives and friends need him, determined to avenge his mother's death, C. J. has no other choice but revert to his old ways.\n\n<i>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</i> is the fifth game in the <i>GTA</i> series. The basic premise remains the same: roam the \"sandbox\" environments, hijack cars, and complete missions to advance the story. The game's world is significantly larger than in its two immediate predecessors, encompassing three cities and a vast countryside between them, with smaller towns, mountains, rivers, and other places of interest. The interactivity with the environment is enhanced, since the player character can now swim and dive, being able to access every corner of the game world.\n\nThe missions vary in structure and gameplay, including chases, races, longer and more intense third-person shooter sequences, as well as a wide variety of vehicles to navigate, which range from different new types of cars (such as lowriders), bicycles, motorcycles, to boats, helicopters, planes, trains, and exotic devices such as monster trucks and jetpacks. Some of the missions involve recruiting gang members and attacking turfs belonging to rival gangs.\n\nAs in the previous games, there are many activities to perform outside of the missions. Working as a taxi driver, taking part in races, delivering sick people to hospital, etc., return from the preceding games in the series. <i>San Andreas</i> adds many new activities of its own, some of them with a role-playing flavor. C.J. can go to gym and work out, increasing his stamina. From time to time he has to eat - though overeating will make him look fatter. He is also able to have romantic relationships with certain female characters, asking them out on a dinner, giving them presents, etc.",

      "description": "During the last years of his reign, the North Korean president Choi Kim attempted a reconciliation with the country's southern neighbor, with the ultimate goal of reunification. However, his son, General Choi Song, and the military clique under his leadership, strongly disagreed with the old man's views. Eventually, Choi Song orchestrated his own father's assassination, took control of North Korea, and severed ties with the outside world. \n\nThen the Australian Navy intercepts a North Korean freighter carrying nuclear weapons intended for sale to terrorist cells. In response, China, South Korea, the Allied Nations send troops into the troubled region to topple Song's regime. The Russian Mafia also bases itself in North Korea to take advantage of the situation. A bounty of a hundred million dollars for General Song was declared. This is where the mercenaries enter the playfield.\n\n<i>Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction</i> is a free-roaming war action and driving game with open-ended gameplay in a large world. The player can choose to control any of the three mercenary protagonists, each with their own strengths: North American Chris Jacobs can sustain higher damage; Jennifer Mui from Hong-Kong is proficient in stealth; Mattias Nilsson from Sweden can run faster than the others. Each of the mercenary also speaks different languages, which makes him or her more or less suitable for work with particular factions.\n\nPlayers have free reign of a massive landscape to take bounties on the \"Deck of 52\", a list of most wanted people in General Song's regime. Four factions have moved in to take advantage of the coup for personal gains; each faction will offer the player resources such as vehicles and supplies, as well as missions that the player can use to make money off of. If the player completes missions for a faction, they will offer intel on the locations of various bounties from the deck, although it is possible to track down the bounties without them. \n\nPlayers have a vast array of resources available to them to get the job done.  It is possible to commandeer tanks, choppers and and any other military hardware to blow up the game's destructible landscape across the North Korean countryside.  Helping out various factions provides access to numerous vehicle drops, supply drops, and air strikes. ",

When setting a driver up, his abilities are split into skill areas such as reflexes and pressure-handling, with points assigned to these.  \n\nFurther skills such as Heart, Intimidation and Recovery can be developed to improve either car or driver. AI cars have the same features applied to them race by race.\n\nThe driver's heartbeat is a featured sound effect, and in pressure situations it can be heard above all other sounds. One available skill is the Tiger Effect, which allows you to rewind the game to avoid dangerous situations as they are about to happen.

As usual in the series, you start off pretty low and work your way up in the food chain of the mob, fighting wars with other mafia families and doing all other sorts of dirty work.\n\nThe game is part of the Grand Theft Auto universe, so there you'll occasionally encounter characters you met in previous games of the series, although the storyline is pretty independent and makes few references to previous incidents and events.\n\nAll the other well-known elements of earlier games are in: You can have little side-missions as a pizza delivery boy, vigilante, cab driver, and more.\n\nThe PSP version supports multiplayer gameplay. Up to six gangsters can compete in deathmatches, capture the flag, and king of the hill.",

In the end he must face no.1, Razor who tricked him out of his own car and used it to get to the top.\n\nMany racing modes are carried on from NFSU2 with the addition of \"Milestones\", special events where the driver must evade capture and/or disable police cars by bringing down Pursuit Breakers, specially marked buildings such as gas stations and water towers. For each one of the 15 Blacklisted opponents, the player must win a specific number of events from each of the two main types and gain enough notoriety in the process. The player can invest bet money to buy new cars or improve his existing one's looks and performance so that he remains competitive.\n\nIn <i>Most Wanted</i>, Josie Maran replaces Brooke Burke as the racer girl. The plot is furthered through use of FMV video with live actors and digital sets, which has been heavily enhanced so that it looks quite real.",

It combines racing with puzzles and even some platform action. \n\nThe game is built around a tour mode where the player must complete the stages one by one. Clear these stages by driving fast to the finish or try to top the times required to obtain bronze, silver, and gold medals. There are also stars to collect and a hidden item on every stage to discover. All of the levels are afloat in the air, so if the player happens to drift off the course, the car drops into nothingness.\n\nThere are many multiplayer modes, including bonus games such as soccer, ice hockey and a Snake game played with cars. In the track editor, players can construct their own gravity-defying tracks and share them through a wireless connection.  ",

While a Jet Moto hoverbike might look like a jet ski, it is capable of far more: it travels across land as well as water and can use a magnetic grapple to make extremely tight turns. During a race, drivers must skillfully time jumps, dodge obstacles, and contend with some feisty opponents who won't hesitate to bump you into a tree or maybe even knock you off a cliff.\n\nJet Moto 3 offers ten different riders and 19 tracks across the wide open ocean, over mountainous terrain, and through cityscapes. As with the earlier games, two people can still race in a split-screen mode.",

The complete island is accessible from the beginning and you can either follow the main storyline, engage in side-missions, or collect items all over the place. To help the revolution you can also drive the government out of the individual sectors on the island. This is accomplished by a three-stages fight in which you have to go up against a huge army of government forces.\n\nAs a fully trained agent, Rico can also perform many stunts. He has always an parachute equipped which he can open whenever he has enough speed. So he often uses cars or bikes as a jump-pad and then sails smoothly into the sunset.\n\nBut of course he cannot impress the evil regime with that, so he also has access to a wide range of weapons from pistols with unlimited ammo to rocket launchers and machine guns. Rico is also trained to drive everything that has an engine, from a normal bike to a fully-armed military helicopter.",

      "description": "The 2006 game in the <i>Need for Speed</i> series is an evolution of the gameplay introduced in the previous games. The career mode offers complete freedom in a city with a story mode supported by FMV cutscenes, as featured in Need for Speed: Most Wanted, but now also set in the Carbon Canyon, where racers duel for territory in the city below. There still are many police pursuits. At the same time, the focus on tuning and sculpting your car remains, as introduced in Need for Speed Underground. As you win money from races, you can visit garages and car lots to make improvements to your vehicle.\n\nEnhancements are still unlocked gradually, but the cars have now been divided over different tiers. There are about 40 cars to unlock. Many of them have been featured in previous installments, but there is a new selection and this year's edition introduces powerful muscle cars such as the Ford Mustang and Dodge Charger. Other features include the possibility to form your own crew, more detailed sculpting features, drifting races (introduced in <i>NFS:U</i> and replaced by drag races in <i>NFS:MW</i>) and the new car classes. The PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 versions offer online multiplayer, missing from the PS2, GC and Xbox releases. Up to eight players can race together, in the Pursuit Tag or Pursuit Knockout modes, with a few variations. Pursuit Tag is a race of one civilian car against cop cars. To become the civilian car, you have to tag it and then try to fend off the cops as long as possible until you are tagged again by other players. In Pursuit Knockout everyone starts as a civilian car, but the last one at the end of the first lap becomes a cop and needs to cause as much damage as possible to the other speeders. Another mode allows you to drive cooperatively (up to four players) in a single race.\n\nThe city and the surroundings in the career mode have been divided into different territories, controlled by gangs. You are either invited or challenged to race in the sections and claim them as your own. To do so, you have to impress the gang leader by winning races until he challenges you for a duel - first in the city, then over the narrow roads of Carbon Canyon. Scores are based on proximity. You need to follow the boss in the first race, and he is in pursuit in the second one. There are 4 boss duels in total.\n\nThe crew feature, with room for up to 6 cars, allows you to assign three roles to racers: drafters, scouts and blockers. These are supporting characters you can hire to help you win races. Drafters leave behind a coloured trail that makes it easier to find the way, scouts discover hidden shortcuts, and blockers try to cause mayhem to slow your opponents down. If you hire a scout, you get access to the new AutoSculpt feature. It enables you to modify the height of every part of your car through sliders, solely for visual effect. You can also buy full body kits.",

      "description": "<i>Full Auto 2: Battlelines</i> is the sequel to the auto racing combat game Full Auto, that debuted in February of 2006 on the Xbox 360.  \n\nThe sequel builds on the original in many ways by offering improved damage modeling on all of the cars and environments, new gameplay modes, expanded multiplayer, new cars and weapons and a new story. \n\nThe gameplay revolves around vehicular combat, with players choosing from one of several cars and then kitting them out with various primary and secondary weapons that can be mounted on the front and back, or just the front of the car. Each part of Meridian city is a different district with a different graphical style. As you move from area to area, you'll usually have three or four levels that culminate in you earning a new car. In each level, you'll also have the opportunity to complete secondary objectives which can net you extra skins for your cars, new cars and new weapons when you've completed a number of secondary objectives.\n\nThere are two basic types of levels: Racing and Arena. In the racing levels, you'll be tasked with getting from point A to point B or going in a number of laps in a circuit. Levels get complex though as you might have a time limit, a specific car you need to destroy, a car you need to project, or a certain number of level objects you need to destroy in addition to getting to the end of the race. Arena matches are non-linear battle arenas where you'll be pit against a number of cars in a free roaming area. You'll often need to destroy a certain number of cars, a certain car a number of times, or destroy more cars than any of your other opponents. There's a wide range of objectives for you to complete in both arena and racing.\n\nBack from the previous game is the 'Unwreck' feature that allows you to rewind time. Don't like the way you got killed there? Rewind time. Miss a power-up? Do it over. Narrowly miss killing an opponent? Try again. Just be careful, as it also uses boost energy. Using boost and unwreck at the long time will either make you not fast enough to win or cause you to run dry when you really do need to unwreck.\n\nEnvironments are now much more interactive. For example, you can destroy a monorail train's track supports and the monorail will crash onto the race area, or destroy the supports on a dry docked boat to try and make it land on cars behind you. \n\nThe game also has eight player online multiplayer and two player split-screen multiplayer. You can race or fight in an arena free for all or on a team. Online play has two additional gameplay modes called 'Cat and Mouse' and 'Base Assault'. Cat and Mouse will have you protecting your 'mouse' while trying to take out the other teams - attack and defend while your team counts on you for success! Base Assault has you attacking the other team's base while defending your own. To score a point, you need to drive the bomb power up to the opposing teams base to blow up their building to score.",

      "description": "<i>Vice City Stories</i> is a prequel to Grand Theft Auto: Vice City (2 years earlier) and it is the sequel to Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories. Set in 1984, players take on the role of Vic Vance, an army soldier who loves his country, family, and himself. One bad decision turns everything around and he is kicked onto the streets of a tough city. He has to build an empire to survive, or be left to die. Together with his brother Lance, a drug addict, the siblings try to take over Vice City.\n\nJust like other GTA titles, gameplay consists of third-person shooting and driving sequences in an open environment. You will meet new enemies and gangs, and old foes. The missions require you to kill with a selection of weapons, steal vehicles such as a car, a boat, or a plane, rob to make it big, or just to have fun. New features for the portable version include swimming, and side missions such as Air Rescue, Vigilante, Firefighter, and Paramedic.\n\nSimilar to San Andreas' gang wars, this title has an Empire mode. To make money, you have to take over businesses from other gangs. By attacking and damaging rival businesses, it will be put up for sale, for you to take over. With a new building constructed, you can then choose an activity such as prostitution, drugs, protection racket, smuggling, robbery, or work as a loan shark. These activities earn money and the location in the city influences the revenue.\n\nMultiplayer is available over Wi-Fi with ten different game modes, either focusing on fighting (Vice City Survivor), businesses (Empire Takedown), racing (Street Rage), stealing/selling (Grand Theft Auto), capture the flag game types, or games centered around a single vehicle such as a tank.",

Single players may work to be the best in the career mode, while up to 14 players can compete online for the highest rank on the global system. There are a total of 160 races on 22 courses in the single-player campaign that weave their way through such environments as the Lost Ruin, Industrial Drive, and the Shadow Caves. Players may choose from 40 cars, and then customize their ride with 375,000 decorative possibilities and 7,150 tuning modifications (a new feature in the series). The custom whips can be transferred to online multiplayer races, giving players a chance to show off their mechanical and aesthetic skills as well as their driving dexterity.\n\nNew for the Ridge Racer gameplay is the addition of slipstreaming. By staying close behind an opponent, players can increase their top speed and quickly pass the car in front. By drifting at high speed, a nitro bar is filled, with three levels: quick boost, double boost and triple boost.",

The colorful worlds are Toon Village, Toon Island 2, Crazy Coaster, Gulliver House 2 and the Haunted Castle.\n\nThe Championship mode takes you through all five tracks. For practice you can select from a single race, time attack and free run. You can even play back your races in the Replay Theater. \n\nThe game includes a second disc for a two-player mode where you can link two separate playstations together. While racing, there are 17 power-ups to take out the competition: Bomb, FireBall, Jump, Missile, Crazy Mushroom, Dynamite, 32t Weight, Stealth Field, Turbo, Big Bigger Biggest, Tiny Tiny Tiny, Oil Can, Pandora's Box, Wonder Clock, Magic Hand, Power Up, Super Shield.",

      "description": "<i>DiRT</i> is the first racing game in the Colin McRae series not to solely focus on the rally championship. It features other offroad events with vehicles like buggies, jeeps or trucks all licensed from the manufacturers. Races are not always solo against the times of other drivers, but up to eight cars often race together on a single track.\n\nThe main game mode is the career where you work your up a pyramid of different tiers with events ranging from normal Rallies over Crossover or Corr to Hill Climb. For every event you complete successfully, you get points and money. Money is used to buy new cars. While the amount of money depends on choosing one of the five difficulty levels, the amount of points depends on your final result in the event; you receive the maximum of 10 points for completing an event with a first place regardless of the difficulty level. These points are needed to unlock new events in the current tier. If you have gathered enough points the next tier will be automatically unlocked so you don't need to do every race in a tier in order to unlock the final event at the top. The difficulty level not only influences the strength of the other drivers, but also how critical the damage is upon hitting obstacles. Some events are further split up into two or three races where the damage is carried over and the allotted sixty seconds worth of damage repair is not offered after every subevent. The main parts that can be repaired are the engine, turbo, exhaust, gearbox, bodywork, wheels, suspension, cooling system and it is also possible to clean the entire car.\n\nAll events feature several licensed true-to-detail-vehicles which also have a detailed damage model. Each vehicle can in addition be tuned in several categories like engine or suspension before each event. To help you make it even more individual, you can create your own look of the car with several dozens predefined kits. There are also 182 different liveries to collect in the game and 46 different cars.\n\nIn addition to the career mode, the game features the classic Colin McRae rally mode with four championships where you need to proof your worth in several car categories like 2WD or Classic. Of course you can also do a time trial, a single event or a single race.\n\nIf you're tired of driving only against the AI, you can go online and compete against up to 100 other players at the same time. An official ranking ladder is also available. After each race your best times can be compared directly to other drivers worldwide.",

Handling is loose and arcade-oriented, and the setup options are not as detailed as those in DiRT. \n\nThere are fifteen circuits across 5 terrain types - safari, alpine, tropical, canyon and arctic. As such, you must drive through snow, sleet, sand, mud, water and gravel. Track deformation technology ensures that no 2 laps are ever the same, as grooves are impacted into the ground and snow is moved off the primary racing line.\n\nGame modes include Quick Race, Championship, Time Attack and Online multiplayer. Time Attack allows plays to set their best times and upload them to 360 Live or PSN. Similarly, players can download other individuals ghosts and try to beat them. Online multiplayer caters for online battles between up to 6 players.",

      "description": "<i>Stuntman: Ignition</i> is a game based on the original 2002 Stuntman game. Players assume the role of a Hollywood stunt driver working for a movie studio. Each level is based upon a movie and players will have to drive through the level, earning points by performing stunts. After the end of each level, players can review their performance by watching the movie trailer that was created.\n\nThere are six movies to choose from, each with different settings, goals and challenges: Aftershock, Whoopin and a Hollerin' II, Strike Force Omega, Overdrive, Never Kill Me Again and Night Avenger. Each movie consists of 6 scenes where the goals set by the director must be followed. To progress, a successful series of stunts is required, but the amount of points can be increased by linking them together and adding extra danger by drifting, getting airborne, or getting close to other cars and obstacles.\n\nThe multiplayer portion offers 2 game modes. In Backlot Battle players have to perform as many stunts as possible in a set amount of laps. Backlot Race offers straightforward racing where boost is earned through stunts. The PS2 version only offers offline gameplay, while the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions have multiplayer supported through the DemonWare middleware.",

The game doesn't have a Free Roam mode (as in Underground 2, Most Wanted or Carbon), but it has an Event Map, similar to Juiced's Event Calendar.\n\nThe player's main goal in this game is to become the \"King of the street\". Nothing new. However, there are no more illegal races in the game - all of the available races are sponsored, and the action takes place on different racing tracks. No more traffic, no more in-town driving.\n\nThe game features 2 gameplay modes. Career (you start your \"life\" as a lowlife race driver and over time you will conquer everyone) and free play (where you can race unlocked cars and unlocked tracks).\n\nAs usual, the game includes a jukebox where you can listen to some singles, used by EA as the game's Sound Track.\nThe game also includes new car models, and the classic racing modes except for cop chases, since ProStreet does not promote illegal racing. Also as usual, when you first start the game you will be prompted to create an alias (profile). You can choose which one will be loaded when you start the game again. After creating the alias, you are prompted to choose your difficulty settings.\n\nAll versions, except for the PlayStation 2 and Wii, contain online multiplayer modes.",

Most of the game's new content is provided through the Earn Your Stripes career mode (PS2).\n\nIn Earn your Stripes, you start by going through time trials to get better starting contracts. After you get a contract, you can start racing. You can tune up your car in the areas of acceleration, tire wear, top speed, among several others. After a set amount of races, you will need to go through another time trial to get to the next set of races. As you complete races and gain reputation, more contracts will come in. In every race, you need to complete some objectives set in your contract. Some contracts are easy to complete (such as finishing a race), while others give more complex objectives (such as gaining several allied cars). Players can also race in the Craftsman Truck, National (Busch), and NEXTEL Cup.\n\nThe PS3 and Xbox 360 versions allow players to share their setups online. The chase mode offers a series of challenges like drafting or passing to unlock new features. All versions offer online multiplayer races.",

      "description": "<i>Burnout Paradise</i> is the first installment in the long-running series, well known for its extreme 60-frames-per-second speed and crash-oriented carnage, to appear on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.\n\nThis title does away with menus to create a seamless integration of event gameplay and online interaction. Rather than dividing races into different sections, the player can fully explore Paradise City as an open world, where every junction is an opportunity to start an event. Just pull up at the traffic lights and rev the engine to start an event. The same applies to the Showtime mode (formerly Crash mode). The preset junctions and traffic are no longer present and the player can now crash at any location in the world, by activating the Showtime mode. It can also be used in regular modes, as well as online games. The main game mode has the player earn credit to unlock new licenses and cars. The five main event types are:<ul>\n<li>Race: the first one to reach the finish wins.</li>\n<li>Road Rage: perform a number of takedowns before time runs out.</li>\n<li>Marked Man: race for a location and survive the attacks from another car that tries to take you down.</li>\n<li>Stunt Run: use stunt moves to reach a target score.</li>\n<li>Burning Route: a unique route for each car in the game.</li></ul>There are more than 80 cars present and there is a reworked damage system. More parts can be torn off and the state of the car determines if the player can keep driving or has to wait for a reset. Objects in the environment can now also be deformed.\n\nThe game supports mugshots with support for a camera. When a player is taken down, both players have their photo taken, exchanged and saved on the hard drive. There are also camera-less persons or an avatar can be used.",

      "description": "The Serbian ex-soldier Niko Bellic had witnessed the horrors of war, which turned him bitter and cynical. Disappointed by life, he immigrates to the United States, which his cousin Roman enthusiastically describes as a country of wealth and pleasure. However, the reality is quite different: Roman is poor, has no stable job, and owes money to some dubious individuals. As Niko attempts to help his hapless cousin and pave a more secure future for both of them, he becomes more and more involved in the life of crime. A burning desire to find a man who had betrayed him in Serbia forces Niko to make deals with his conscience, and once he crosses the line, there is no way back...\n\n<i>Grand Theft Auto IV</i> is the ninth title and the fourth main game in the <i>Grand Theft Auto</i> series, and also the first for the seventh generation of consoles. Following the tradition of the 3D installments of the series, the game is entirely located in one of the three cities of the original GTA, Liberty City, but now in present time, and with an environment reminiscent of GTA III, though bigger and more detailed. Liberty City is heavily based on New York, where the protagonist has to gain respect, welfare and power throughout the game. \n\nLike in most <i>GTA</i> games, the city map is gradually uncovered during the course of the game. The player starts in Broker (based on Brooklyn), and, in order to access the other three districts of the city (based on the other major boroughs of New York City), has to make progress in the storyline. The game has the usual structure based on missions. The player can sometimes engage in various missions at the same time, and has free access to the non-mission features of the game while being on one.\n\nMost of the usual elements of exploration and interaction with the city are included in <i>GTA IV</i>. Niko can cause mayhem in the city, hijack cars, listen to radio stations, observe the behavior of the citizens, enter thematic buildings, work as vigilante, taxi driver, or ambulance driver, hire a prostitute, go to a strip club, and so on. Among the new features is the possibility to watch television (with several channels broadcasting various fictional programs) and connect to a fictional Internet, with functional websites (mostly of a humorous nature) created specifically for the game, and an e-mail program. Other additions include looking for criminals in the police department database from a police car, hiring taxi cabs to safely travel to selected destinations, extensive usage of the mobile phone, improved A.I. of the pedestrians, and others. \n\nSome features from the previous games are missing, such as drivable airplanes and a few other vehicle types. Niko retains the ability to swim and engage in romantic relationships with female characters, features first introduced in San Andreas. However, the light role-playing elements (training to increase stamina, eating, etc.) from the previous entry have been removed. \n\n<i>GTA IV</i>  focuses on third-person shooter gameplay more than the previous installments; most of the missions have larger portions dedicated to on-foot navigation and shooting. Crouching, leaning, and taking cover play a more important role in combat. Hand-to-hand combat has also been re-designed, Niko being able to execute more precise moves. \n\nThe game uses the euphoria motion engine, an alternate middleware solution much like ragdoll physics, which makes all people in the game world move realistically depending on the situation around them. For example, every time Niko enters a car, a different animation will be generated depending on his position relative to the car.\n\nA new feature compared to the predecessors is the multiplayer. The same free-roaming environment is offered for up to 16 players (32 in the Windows version) in 15 modes. Certain modes narrow down the environment to make sure players remain somewhat in each other's vicinity. Compared to the console releases, the Windows release features high resolution graphics, a video editor to capture and edit in-game footage, and the possibility to customize the radio station Independence FM with own songs.",

It also contains improved support for Logitech Driving Force steering controllers and a wider variety of options. Ferraris will be included for the first time in the series and it includes visible car damage.\n\nThe driving physics have been  improved on and cars handle more realistically than in GT4. The game contains more music, ranging from lounge and jazz-funk to indie and electronica.\n\nThe base version is upgraded through different digital downloads, adding new modes and videos (1.11 - December 2007) and a much larger update (2.0 - March 2008) with new cars, circuits, modes, events and different features. Since 2.0, the game is referred to as <i>Gran Turismo 5: Prologue - Spec II</i>. That version was updated once more in April 2008 as 2.10 with more features. These updates are free to download, but in some countries the updated version is actually the retail one. PAL regions received the 2.0 version while North American received 2.10 by default.",

      "description": "The heart of <i>GRID</i> is the career-mode called GRID World. Divided into the three regions USA, Europe and Japan, the player has to earn money and prestige points to move up into a higher license category which then gives him access to more and harder racing events. These events are divided into categories like normal races, Drift-events, Destruction Derbies and even the famous 24 hours race in Le Mans.\n\nBut of course not every car is suitable for every event so there are several different series to chose from. So while the player drives a tuned car for the Drift- or Racing-events in Japan, muscle cars await him in for the Destruction Derbies in the USA or Formel 3000 racers in Europe. Each car also handles very differently. Of course the player needs to buy the suitable car first before he can enter a tournament. There he can decide if he wants to buy a brand new car or go over to eBay Motors and look for a solid used car which of course cost less but has already seen some crashes and might not provide the best possible performance.\n\nTo earn the money to buy a car for a event, the player can complete so-called Driver Offers. These are offers by other racing teams to take part in an event and see it through. But there are also bonus objectives like \"Finish before Team Top Secret\" which grant the player additional cash if he successfully completes them.\n\nBesides money the player also earns prestige points. These are required to unlock the next higher license category in the corresponding country. Of course tournaments give way more points than completing Driver Offers but the player can also get a few more points by adjusting the realism settings before the race. The higher the realism is, the higher the point gain will be after successful finishing the event. These settings include things like a difficulty level, traction assistant or how many flashbacks the player has available during a race. These flashbacks are similar to the Sands of Time in the Prince of Persia-Series. If the player for example drifts out into the gravel pit, he can activate the instant replay, rewind time a little bit and then immediately reenter the race at that point and try to avoid the crash.",

There are 250 cc and 550 cc bikes and four ATV models, but also monster trucks, offroad dune buggys and trophy trucks.\n\nPlayers can pull off insane stunts and compete in six different racing series (Supercross, Nationals, Opencross, Supermoto, Freestyle and Rally) or in the X-Cross, a tournament of all the series wrapped into one, plus sponsorships can be acquired: good performances have the player receive better bikes. It also features Crash Camera, a super slow-mo breakdown of accidents and crashes, similar to MotorStorm.\n\nSome mini-games have been included as well, including ATV hockey, Monster Truck Smash and Tag to name a few. The online mode has the player compete against other competitors. The gameplay is very similar to the console systems, certain buttons for gas, brakes while the Wii remote can be used as well.\n\nThe DS and PSP versions are almost similar. While the DS has few vehicles and only has a championship mode unlike the many series in the major console versions, it contains ten exclusive tracks and three stadiums. The PSP version is almost similar, but has different series from the consoles: Race, One on One, Time Attack, Stunt Challenge, Stunt Race, Hang-Time, Combo Challenge, Flag Challenge. It also has the X-Cross tournament, but it is named the MX vs. ATV World Tour instead. Games can be played against friends using Wi-Fi.",

The versions vary per country and region (1.1, 1.2, 2.0) and were released both on discs and as digital downloads. All versions for the game made available through the PlayStation Store were free of charge. The Japanese retail version <i>Gran Turismo HD: Install Disc</i> includes v1.1 of the game, the Concept Movie Type B video trailer and a PlayStation Store manual.\n\nEventually, in March 2007 the planned full title <i>Gran Turismo HD</i> was cancelled and all priority was given to <i>Gran Turismo 5</i>. Instead, Gran Turismo 5: Prologue was released as a new sneak preview of the full GT5 game.",

In each town you can talk to other cars, complete quests, race, compete in mini-games such as car golf, car soccer, and car roulette, and upgrade your car with hundreds of different parts.\n\nYou can also collect photos of scenic locations, collect coins scattered around the terrain, and collect stamps for completing various tasks.\n\nThere's a story to the game to support the need to race and upgrade. The world president, also a car, has had enough of being a president and wants to quit. He has decided to award the presidency to the winner of the World Grand Prix (WGP), or more precisely the winner of the WGP can challenge the president for the title.\n\nAll-in-all that sets the scene for a lot of racing because to have a chance of winning the WGP the player needs two team mates and a Super-A license. To get a Super A license the player must finish all nine class A races in at least sixth place but to enter those races they will need an A license. To get an A license they must finish all class B races in at least sixth place but to enter those races they will need an B license. To get a B license they must finish all six class C races in at least sixth place.\n\nWinning races earns cash and cash can be spent on upgrades.\n",

      "description": "A Venezuelan billionaire named Ramon Solano hires a mercenary to rescue general Carlos Carmona, who attempted a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat and failed. After  a successful completion of the objective Solano refuses to pay and tries to kill the mercenary, who barely escapes.\n\nAfterwards, Carmona and Solano take over Venezuela, pulling off a successful coup, capturing the country's oil platforms, putting the world on alert as they seize total control of the country. Unbeknownst to them, the mercenary has survived and is now plotting revenge against the two. The mercenary must take contracts from rival factions such as Universal Petroleum, an oil company whose business is threatened by Solano, the P.L.A.V. (People\u2019s Liberation Army of Venezuela), who are a force of rebel soldiers determined to take back their country, the Jamaican Pirates, who profit from Solano's forces, the A.N. (Allied Nations), who have entered the company to try and bring back stability to the region, and the Chinese Army, who hope to take control of Venezuela as well, marking themselves as a true superpower.\n\n<i>Mercenaries 2: World in Flames</i> is a free-roaming driving and action game. In the beginning the player selects one of three mercenaries from the previous game (Mattias Nilsson, Chris Jacobs and Jennifer Mui). Each merc has a special ability: Jennifer can run faster than others, Mattias regenerates his health faster, and Chris can carry more ammo. The gameplay is similar to that of the preceding game, with a few minor changes, one of which is a new way to hijack tanks: whereas in the previous game the player could simply walk up to the tank and automatically hijack it, it is now necessary to participate in quick-time events to get rid of the enemy gunner. It is possible to use a grappling hook to latch onto passing helicopters in order to hijack them. As opposed to the previous game, player characters can swim.\n\nThe protagonist now has a \"headquarters\" of sorts, where he or she can stockpile weapons, supply crates and vehicles. To obtain these stockpiles the protagonist must recruit three certain soldiers unlockable in the game: a helicopter pilot named Ewan Garrett, who delivers stockpile crates found by the player character to the headquarters; a mechanic named Eva Navarro, who will repair and stock vehicles, and is used for artillery strikes; and a fighter pilot named Misha Milanich, who is used for air strikes. Fiona Taylor reprises her role, giving the player technical information and training missions.\n\nThere is no more black market contacts to purchase supplies or airstrikes; instead players must take complete jobs for contacts scattered on the island. Completing jobs for these contacts will supply the headquarters with materials such as weapons, medikits, and artillery support. It is also possible to stockpile vehicles by driving back to their headquarters, keeping them at the garage for use in missions. Also, gas is needed to bring in supplies or call in airstrikes, which can be obtained by either completing contracts or collecting them scattered throughout the country.\n\nOnce again, bounties come into play, but instead of the \"Deck of 52\" from the first game, there are now \"High Value Targets\", military leaders that have defected from the Venezuela military and declared themselves independent from Solano as well as competing factions. They are scattered throughout the map; capturing them alive will grant the player character more money, while killing them will only net half the bounty as a reward. There are also \"treasures\" lying around the island, such as fuel cans, weapons schematics and even pirate treasure chests; each has their own monetary value for collecting them.\n\nThere are also new vehicles in the game, as well classic vehicles, such as modernized tanks, more powerful helicopters and even (for the first time) boats and other watercraft such as jet ski, as well as civilian muscle cars, high-end racing cars, and specialized vehicles for each faction.",

      "description": "<i>Pure</i> puts the player behind the handlebars of an All Terrain Vehicle (ATV) - better known as a Quad Bike, but instead of just choosing one from a pre-existing ensemble, he has to build his Quad Bikes from scratch himself.\n\nFrom the suspension over the engine to the form and color of the handle bars, he has many options to choose from. By playing through the heart of the game, the World Tour single player campaign, he unlocks additional parts by winning the events and collecting the flag hidden on the track. Some parts are purely cosmetically and don't change the stats of the bike but others have a great impact and come in a freestyle or race version. Deciding on which to use greatly influences how the Quad Bike behaves in terms of speed or how easy the player can perform tricks on it. Since the player also unlocks additional room in his garage, he can build the perfect Quad Bike for every one of the available game modes (Race, Sprint, Freestyle). This is especially important once the race has started because of the way how boost is handled.\n\nEach trick the player makes gives him more or less boost, depending on how good it was and such factors. That boost can then be used to give your Quad Bike a temporary speed advantage. But at the same time the amount of boost the player has collected, defines which tricks can be performed. At the beginning of the race, only basic tricks are available to the driver and as he gains boost, he first unlocks advanced and then professional tricks. So the player hast to decide if he wants to be able to perform more difficult tricks, and gain more boost with one trick, or if he will sacrifice this ability for a short speed advantage.\n\nWhile the game modes race and sprint are just races where the one wins, who is on the first position at the end, in freestyle the place doesn't matter. Instead the player needs to perform tricks to gain points. Once a trick has been successfully pulled off, a timer starts and when the player performs another trick before it runs out, the multiplicator goes up. There are also power-ups scattered around the map which allow the player to perform a special trick, double his points or refuel him a little. Especially the last one is important since the race goes on until the player runs out of fuel. Once everyone is out of fuel, the one with the most points wins.",

There the player creates a character, chooses a bike and a helmet for him and starts in the 125cc class with the goal to race to the top of the MotoGP class in only five years. After each successful race the player not only unlocks new content but also gains career points which can be invested into bike upgrades increasing the max speed, acceleration, braking abilities or traction.\n\nThe other game modes are:<ul><li>Time Trial - Beat the time records on the different tracks.</li><br>\n<li>Tournament - Create a driver or choose a driver from the 2008 season to compete in a series of races.</li><br>\n<li>Challenges - 50 challenges in seven categories demand a great deal of the player to unlock additional game content. Challenges include staying over a certain speed limit for a pre-defined amount of time or winning a 1on1 on the last few meters of a race track.</li></ul>The game also features a multiplayer mode for up to 12 players (not for the PS2 version).

There are 16 different International tracks to compete in ranging from Silverstone in England to Homestead-Miami Speedway in Florida and features over 50 different Ferrari models to race in.\n\nThere are a variety of modes to choose from: <i>Challenge</i>, <i>Arcade</i>, <i>Quick Race</i>, <i>Time Trial</i> and features the technical expertise of GP2 driver, Bruno Senna, who is the nephew of Formula One legend Ayrton to give the cars and game a more realistic feel including handling and a responsive AI similar to their real-life counterparts.\n\nWhile the games are similar there are some differences such as graphics and control scheme (the PS2 and PS3 use a similar scheme while the Wii utilizes the Wii-Remote and the Wii Wheel).  Also the PS3 has online capabilities where players can compete in online races.",

So the player enters the city with the goal to earn enough reputation and respect in the syndicate to get to him.\n\nOf course this is not done by just walking up to someone and asking nicely. Instead the player freely roams the big city in his cars and accepts missions at every corner. These range from simple races to Burnout-inspired \"Destroy as much as possible\" goals. A completely new mode is the Highway Battle in which the player needs to put 300 meters between him and his opponent with the main enemy being the incoming rush hour traffic. Other missions require the player to bring a specific car in the best possible condition to a garage. Since the player is undercover, the police are always watching him and make his life more and more difficult as the wanted level of the car increases.\n\nSuccessful races not only earn the player reputation to unlock new challenges and new parts of the city but also bring cash which can be invested in new cars or in the tuning of old ones. In addition one of the ten stats of the character automatically advances granting him more money for a win or increasing his ability to brake.",

To unlock the next league, the player has to win a certain amount of points in the current one. The main difference between each league is that the game gets progressively faster and thus it's harder to keep control of the racer. The race modes are single race, tournament, time trial, fastest lap and zones, where acceleration is automatic, and the single goal is to survive as long as possible without the ship breaking apart.\n\nShips are controlled mainly by air brakes to achieve tight turns at high speeds. In certain race modes, players also have power-ups at their disposal, like weapons and speed boosts. It is possible to win a race by destroying the entire competition as well. The game also features a multiplayer online mode.",

      "description": "At the end of Saints Row the city of Stilwater was in the hands of the 3rd Street Saints. But the main protagonist also got blown up on Mayor Alderman's yacht, putting him in a coma. So things went down from there.\n\nTwo years have passed now and the main protagonist finally wakes up from their sleep only to find themself in prison and the city of Stilwater controlled by several rival gangs, with Johnny Gat about to be put on the electric chair. With the help of Carlos, a fellow inmate, the protagonist escapes, rescues Johnny Gat and once again begins to reform the gang and move the 3rd Street Saints back up to number 1.\n\nBefore the player can enter the open and non-linear environment of the city, they need to define who the main protagonist is by using an extensive character creator which allows for changing everything from gender to the size of the characters ears and the voice acting. But that's not the limit of customization in <i>Saints Row 2</i>. In shops scattered all around the city the player can buy additional clothing from underwear to hats to not only change their appearance but also the gang's. These clothes are then also available in the up to six cribs the player can unlock and buy during the course of the game. Besides changing their appearance, the player can also stash weapons and cash there, withdraw the daily earnings, rewatch cutscenes and more. He can also change the overall style of the crib and buy new stuff like a TV-set which grants him additional style points.\n\nStyle and Respect are the most important currencies besides money in the city. While respect is used to unlock missions and progress through the storyline, the player's style affects the overall respect modifier increasing the amount of respect earned. As stated style points are earned by upgrading the characters look, home or car. Respect points are instead earned through the many activities and diversions available in the city.\n\nActivities are mini-games that are started at a one of two specific points in the game world and span out over six difficulty levels. After completing three levels, the player gains unlockables like a 5% discount on clothes. Besides activities already known from <i>Saints Row</i>, <i>Saints Row 2</i> includes six new ones including \"Crowd Control\" in which the player needs to protect a VIP from intrusive fans and \"FUZZ\", a parody of COPS in which the player is followed by a camera crew and has to deal with criminals in a very creative manner to gain points. Diversions on the other hand include the simple driving on the wrong side of the road, doing stunts, playing poker in a casino, hijacking a car with more than one person in it and taking the passengers hostage and doing the job side-missions like driving the tow-truck or playing taxi.\n\nThe game also features several multiplayer modes ranging from a two-person coop-mode to twelve player deathmatch (\"Gangsta Brawl\") and team-deathmatch (\"Team Gangsta Brawl\") and a mode called \"Strong Arm\" in which the team wins that manages to earn $100.000 first. This is accomplished by winning events based on single player activities like racing. Each activity has a time limit and at the end the winner goes home with $10.000.",

      "description": "<em>Baja: Edge of Control</em> is an off-road racing game based on the real-life Baja 1000 race series held in California. The tracks are set in a desert environment and there's over 1000 miles of route to explore. In the main career mode, the idea is to start at the bottom class of off-road racing with a VW Beetle. By performing well in races, players earn prize & sponsorship money and experience points to buy better machines and unlock higher classes. In order to secure the sponsorship money, their logos must still be on the car at the end of the race, so too much damage to the car will result in the player not getting paid. The vehicles can be tuned and modified to increase performance.\n\nThere are five different race modes; circuit which is a standard race where you do a few laps of a track against opponents, rally which a point to point time-trial, hill climb which as it suggests is drive up a steep hill, and then back down, open class where different categories of car race against each other with a handicap system in place to disadvantage the more powerful ones and Baja which is an endurance race lasting between 250-1000 miles. The Baja mode races can last up to several hours.",

Milo is also an undercover-agent sent to Barcelona to infiltrate the local underworld but he soon finds himself between the fronts of an all-out gang war between three rival groups.\n\nThe player takes on the role of Milo Burik looking over his shoulder while freely walking and driving around the city. As a Wheelman Milo doesn't just drive his car or motorcycle he also uses them as a weapon. By swinging the mouse or using one of the sticks, the player rams his car into other cars until they go up in flames. It also allows him to quickly switch lanes or ram through barricades. By destroying other vehicles, speeding and generally reeking mayhem in the city, the player also fills up his focus power which is needed for special attacks. Utilizing this power allows him to get a speed boost, get perfect aim at high speeds or perform a 180\u00b0 turn, aim and destroy his chaser with one shot. But his car isn't Milo's only weapon. Pistols, machine guns and such too await to be used outside and inside cars and if his own car is about to blow up or if he just doesn't like the color anymore, he can perform an air jack. An air jack is possible once Milo's car is close enough to another car or motorcycle. After releasing the corresponding button, he then jumps over, removes the original driver and continues on his journey in his new vehicle.\n\nAll this is used to advance in the main storyline as well as in the many side-missions the player can take on. These range from Taxi-missions in which the player needs to get a passenger to his goal as fast as he can, to rampages in which destruction is everything and capture and delivery missions in which Milo needs to use his air jack ability to steal a specific vehicle and get it to the drop point in time. In common have all that at the end the player is rated based on his performance with \"S\" being the highest rank and \"C\" the lowest. If the player managed to get at least an \"A\" he unlocks additional missions and ultimately access to additional repair shops and weapon depots. Once unlocked the next story mission as well as every side-activity can be accessed directly from the city map on the PDA.",

These are able to drive over other cars, destroy vegetation and damage structures. Some abilities have been enhanced, for instance bikers can now duck or hop over obstacles. Like its predecessor, the tracks are unconventional and contain multiple routes, not all of them suitable.\n\nThe tracks will wear down through consecutive laps and this affects the vehicles' behaviour. Smaller vehicles also suffer resistance from vegetation, while the bigger rigs can plough straight through. Areas with water cause the engine to cool down, affecting the behaviour as well. The game can be played split-screen with up to four players.\nThe game also had online multiplayer modes but the game's online servers were closed down on 1 October 2012.",

      "description": "In <i>Car Jack Streets</i>, player take the role of Randal Meyers. Randal has a big problem: he owes the Italian mafia a million dollars. The mobs can't wait so Randal has to either pay them $50,000 each week or get killed. The player therefore has to do whatever he can to earn as much money as possible, whether it's through taxi driving, car theft, assassinations or pizza delivery. Failing to reach the weekly payments will lead to game over.\n\nThe game is similar to the original Grand Theft Auto (the development team actually consists of former DMA Design employees). As with that game, it's a mix of a action and a racing game viewed from a top-down perspective, where players get to explore the city either by foot or behind the wheel of numerous vehicles. Cash is earned by doing jobs for the different gangs in the city. For each day the player is offered four different criminal jobs and in addition to these, jobs like taxi driving and pizza delivery are always available. To help the player get to the right locations a GPS is available. ",

      "description": "<i>FUEL</i> is a free-world racing game. Players can explore a 14.000 km\u00b2 area of Northern America after the effects of global warming took place, rendering it desolate with abandoned cities, broken vehicles and almost no survivors. The goal is to win races, which provides fuel that can be exchanged for new vehicles. The game world is divided in nineteen separate zones that need to be unlocked by collecting stars \u2013 provided through winning career races. Up to 75 different types of vehicles can be unlocked during the course of the game. The vehicles can be modified with paint jobs and liveries.\n\nBesides the regular career races, which are restricted to a specific vehicle class like ATV, buggy or motorbike, challenges are another event type in the game. These include for example chasing a helicopter through the terrain or trying to touch other vehicles within a given time limit. Next to the races and challenges that can be accessed right away, the game also offers the ability to drive freely in each of the zones to explore the environment. This is further encouraged by having to locate new liveries, vista points, and doppler trucks that show the locations of all items. The terrain is dense and the appropriate vehicle needs to be selected to explore freely. There are many extreme weather effects, such as pouring rain, snow, thunder storms and even hurricanes.\n\nThe general gameplay is arcade-like. Even though the terrain affects the performance, vehicles cannot be damaged and there is an option to respawn when crashing into objects. The roads are littered with obstacles and the game encourages to break away from the regular tracks to locate shortcuts and use jumps to cross large distances. Players can also create their own tracks through waypoints in the zone. A general HUD shows the race statistics and marks the course, along with a mini-map. <i>FUEL</i> can also be played online against up to 16 players.",

      "description": "<i>Red Faction: Guerrilla</i> is the third entry of the Red Faction series and deviates from the first-person shooter genre that the previous two incarnations featured and incorporates an open world sandbox environment similar to Mercenaries, Grand Theft Auto or Saints Row ( which the developer, Volition, has also developed).\n\nSet 50 years after the events of the first two games, Mars has been liberated from the devious Ultor Corporation by Red Faction and the E.D.F. (Earth Defense Force) has stepped in to help the Miner Community get back on their feet.  However, the E.D.F. has become an occupying force, taking over the planet, executing citizens and imposing martial law on the planet.  As a result a new Red Faction element has been formed to fight the E.D.F. and once again bring peace and freedom to the Martian landscape.  The player takes control of Alec Mason, a recently arrived dissident of Earth hoping to make his new life on Mars with his brother Dan, only to be swept up in the Revolution and free Mars five sectors (Parker, the Badlands, Oasis, the Free Fire Zone and Eos) from E.D.F. control.  To do this the player must complete missions and destroy E.D.F. vehicles and property, lowering their control on each sector and raising the morale of the resident population.\n\nThe missions range from story missions which purpose is to further advance the story and other missions including Transporter (returning certain vehicles to a safehouse in a certain amount of time), Guerrilla Raid (where the player and a group of Rebels attack and E.D.F. building and destroying it), Heavy Metal (where the player provides a distraction which allows fellow rebels to complete another mission without alarming the E.D.F.), Demolition Master (which the player has to destroy a target within a certain time limit and a limited supply of ammo) and House Arrest (where the player must rescue hostages and return them to a safehouse).\n\nThere are also missions that pop-up from time to time including Courier (where the player must track down and kill an enemy spy to collect the information he is carrying), Assault (where the player must defend a certain target against incoming E.D.F. forces) and Convoy (where the player must either destroy a line of vehicles or capture a target vehicle and return it to a safehouse).  Completing these missions will drop enemy control of the area, raise morale of the citizens, be awarded scrap and unlock more advanced weapons.  To liberate each section the player must drop the E.D.F. control of the area to zero and complete the story missions, once the player meets this a final story mission will be unlocked which will liberate that sector and unlock story missions for the next.\n\nPlayers have a variety of vehicles to choose from, ranging from cars to trucks, dune buggys and dump trucks and even tanks and APC's (Armored Personal Carriers).  There is also a plethora of weapons including pistols, shotguns, assault rifles, the sledgehammer (the players main weapon which can't be removed), remote mines, anti-personal mines, rocket launchers and the dreaded Nano Rifle (which fires a stream of nanobots that can disintegrate targets within an instant).  The player can carry four different weapons at a time and can swap them out through access at their safehouses or through ammo boxes littered throughout the landscape.  The most advanced weapons such as the Nano Rifle is only unlocked through the story missions while some can be found in E.D.F. buildings (like the Singularity Mine) and each weapon can be upgraded through safehouses which include extra ammo and more firepower through scrap.  Scrap is the game's currency which is obtained through completing missions or destroying E.D.F. buildings and vehicles.\n\nThe game also has an updated Geo-Mod 2.0 game engine which allows the player to virtually destroy a building realistically such as making it lean left by blowing up the left side of the structure or lean forward if the front is blown apart.  Players can use this to their advantage against enemies such as destroying the building from the ground floor, toppling it on enemies and vehicles or destroying the support structures of bridges with explosives, causing it to collapse with a convoy of enemies on top.  It also features the physics engine, Havok for the character physics.\n\nThere is also an offline two-player mode called Wrecking Crew where two friends take turns on four different modes such as <i>Barrel Dash</i>, <i>Total Chaos</i>, <i>Rampage</i> and <i>Escalation</i> and play a certain set of rounds to win an event.  Online multiplayer games are present as well including <i>Anarchy</i>, <i>Team Anarchy</i>, <i>Capture the Flag</i>, <i>Damage Control</i>, <i>Siege</i> and <i>Demolition</i> which awards players experience points that they can use to customize their online players and acquire more advanced weaponry.  Additionally, there are backpacks for the <i>Wrecking Crew</i> and <i>Multiplayer</i> modes which enhances the players abilities such as Jetpacks, Stealth, Vision (essentially an X-ray) and more power-based ones such as Concussion, which will knock over nearby enemy players and Tremor, which can damage enemies as well as structures.\n\nThe PC game comes with the DLC Demons of the Badlands included which was previously only available for the Xbox360 and PS3 consoles.",

      "description": "<i>Clutch</i> is a post-apocalyptic racing game that borrows many elements from the Carmageddon series. In September 2006 a collider (similar to the real Large Hadron Collider of the same time) at the International Research Institute of Atom City causes an anomaly dubbed White Ring to develop. Hardly more than five percent of the inhabitants manages to escape, the others die or are exposed to radiation. A special commission of the UN declares the city a restricted zone, isolated through military force. It soon becomes a haven for smugglers, escapees and bounty hunters. The player controls a man who is contracted to infiltrate the city. He soon discovers most of the inhabitants have been turned into zombies, while there are many outlaws who outfit their cars to race and kill the zombies along the way.\n\nIt is an arcade racing game where the player is free to drive around in the city and pick up missions at hotspots, similar to Need for Speed: Most Wanted or Burnout Paradise. These include regular races, demolition derbies, protection, survivor or hunting missions or tasks where a specific number of zombies, crawling the streets, needs to be killed. Unrelated to the missions, there are also other cars racing the streets and some of them can be taken down by crashing into them to unlock their car skin. There are various power-ups, shaped as spheres, to be found. They repair the car, provide triple damage or money, or restore energy. Energy is used to provide short boosts while racing. By killing zombies or winning events, money and different options are unlocked. Players can buy new cars and outfit them with skins, boosters, front guards (to catch and demolish zombies using the front of the car) and body kits (sharp weapons from the sides of the car). Opponents can be taken out by crashing into them. On some parts of the map anomalies occur, causing the car to speed up or jump. Almost everything in the environment can also be destroyed or pushed around.\n\nAn important difference with similar games is the stress on the background story. The main campaign is divided into three episodes and after each won event the player can read a page in the diary of the protagonist. He tries to win the favours of other racers, gets involved in religious groups and questions the ethics in the city, telling the small stories he experiences on the side, although none of those are shown in the series of races quickly following each other.\n\nThe game supports the RUCAP UM-5 device. Using the WideGlance technology, the game can detect the player's position and based on the player's head turn direction it can be used to control the in-game camera and the one in the garage. The game also supports custom music that can be used in-game by putting it in a specific folder.",

      "description": "<i>Death Track: Resurrection</i> is a remake of the 1989 game Deathtrack. It is a futuristic driving game that combines arcade racing with vehicular combat. The player participates as a rookie pilot in survival races in the future, organized to be broadcasted over television and set in the post-apocalyptic setting of what is left of such cities as Paris, Bangkok, London, Vatican City, Prague, New York, Moscow, Istanbul, San Diego and Tokyo. Between the races, the story of the thrills and sabotage is furthered through rendered cutscenes.\n\nThere are five game modes: Scenario (main story mode), Tournament (three cups where the player can earn money), Challenge (perform tasks through races on the unlocked tracks), Drag Races and Quick Races. Gameplay is arcade-oriented as the tracks are filled with obstacles, sharp twists and Terminator robots that shoot the cars. By winning races, new cars can be acquired and outfitted with upgrades and weapons such as laser, plasma and machine guns, mines, spikes, rocket launchers and flares. There is also Nitrous Oxide to get a boost. Most races need to be won by taking first place, but the opponents can also be killed and in some modes a specific task needs to be performed. Points, converted in cash, also become available through Afterburner (use boost without colliding for a long time), Clean Ride (safe driving), Flight (remain airborne for a while), Destruction (demolish objects along the tracks) and Stunts. Many of the tracks have springboards that can be used to perform stunts, which are then shown in slow-motion using an alternate camera view or a secondary game window.\n\nPlayers can also receives bonuses while driving, based on five levels of competence. These include Haste, Shield, Repair, Points Boost, Damage Boost and Ammo. For each track, a number of presets are available: Modern (bonuses, weapons, respawns), Classic (only point boosts bonuses, weapons, no respawns - similar to the original game), Rally (only haste bonus, no weapons, respawns) and Custom where the player can define parameters. The game does not support multiplayer.",

      "description": "The player's goal in <i>Need for Speed: SHIFT</i> is to take part in the Need for Speed World Tour and become the ultimate champion. As opposed to its predecessors, this doesn't mean racing around an open-world city with pimped cars. Instead the game is more similar to GRID with races taking place on closed city circuits or even famous race tracks like the Circuit de Spa-Franchorchamps.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, the player drives a test-round as well as a race. During this tutorial the game evaluates the player's skill and changes the realism settings accordingly ranging from the usual arcade-style controls with many driving aids to an almost realistic simulation-like driving model. Then the main game begins where the player has to successfully earn stars in order to unlock the next tier and ultimately gain access to the World Tour. Stars are earned by getting on the podium at the end of a race as well as by fulfilling certain objectives on the track. These range from simply gaining a specific amount of points in the race to more challenging objectives like driving a clean lap. Points on the other hand are earned by the player through his driving style and are separated into two groups: Precision and Aggression. While the first group honors clean sectors or driving on the race line, aggression-points are earned by hitting other cars or sliding through curves. Once the player has earned enough points (both categories are summed-up at the end of an event, he gains a level and by doing so unlocks new upgrades for his car, get's a big money bonus or receives an invite to a special race event. To keep the player even more motivated, tons of badges are waiting to be earned which are in part also the same as the available achievements/trophies. Again actions like performing 25 overtakes or winning three consecutive races are needed to earn a minor badge. If he keeps his streak up or has earned all the minor badges in one category, he earns additional badges ranging from bronze to epic.\n\nThe available events include normal races in various variations, a time attack mode, a car attack in which the player needs to be either five seconds in front of his opponent or get 1st place in order to win and drift events. The car park includes many licensed cars from normal middle to high class vehicles to high-powered racing cars which can all be bought through the money earned by winning races or leveling up. In addition the look of the car can be changed by unlocking new vinyls. Also available are extensive upgrade and tuning options allowing the player to change every detail on his car down to the tire pressure.",

      "description": "Sean Devlin is an Irish mechanic and a racer in Paris - or at least he was. One day in 1940, as he takes part in the Grand Prix of Saarbr\u00fccken (Germany), he loses to the Nazi Kurt Dieker through unfair means. As he tries to repay his dept by playing a prank on Dieker, he learns of Diekers real job: being a Nazi torturer. Sean manages to escape back to Paris with the Nazi invasion force on his heel. The game begins three months after these events in the now occupied Paris, where Sean meets the Resistance and more or less willingly joins up with them in order to execute his revenge on Dieker.\n\n<i>The Saboteur</i> is a GTA-like open-world driving and action game set in Paris during World War II. The player takes on the role of Sean, looking over his shoulder while he explores the city and its surroundings either on foot or by car. In order to move the story forward, the player has to fulfill missions for the resistance. There is also a considerable amount of side-missions as well as many other things to do in the city, including - but not limited to - blowing up sniper towers and Nazi tanks and killing Nazi generals. These so-called sabotage actions also net the protagonist contraband, the currency of the game. With it he can buy weapons, upgrades and other items at black-market dealers scattered around the city.\n\nTo do these sabotage acts, the player has access to several different kinds of weapons and explosives from the time period, as well as Sean's fists for melee combat. Though Sean can engage Nazis in hand-to-hand fights, using punches, kicks, and grapple moves, it is often not advisable to go directly into combat, as he needs to escape the Nazis once an alarm has been raised in order to complete his missions. In addition, the alarm level will creep up over time if Sean does additional damage to Nazi property and personal, alarming even heavier forces including tanks and zeppelins. To escape an alarm, he either has to leave a certain area quickly or enter one of the many hide-spots while not being seen.\n\nAfter completing a certain mission, Sean will also be able to call Resistance fighters at his side to help him in combat or bring him a getaway car. These getaway cars need to be collected first by driving them into a black market garage. Once this has been done, the car can be summoned at any garage. \n\nThrough his actions the player also unlocks perks granting certain rewards, e.g. \"Sucker Punch\", which is gained after killing ten enemy soldiers without them ever knowing. Sean can even slip into an enemy uniform to infiltrate the Nazis undetected; however, if he is seen doing a suspicious activity, the alarm will be raised after a certain amount of time. Other prominent activities include running and climbing on buildings, similarly to the protagonist of Assassin's Creed, giving the player the freedom to choose his own route to the target.\n\nAt the start of the game, Paris and its surroundings are covered in black and white in a very similar style to the one seen in the movie <i>Schindler's List</i>, with only certain colors standing out, such as the red in every Nazi-symbol and the yellow lights behind windows. As the player helps the Resistance liberate the sectors, color returns and Nazi activity goes down.",

      "description": "As it's predecessor, the racing-game <i>DiRT 2</i> doesn't just focus on accurately simulating the Rallye-sport like the earlier installments of the Colin McRae-Series did. Instead eight types of Offroad-events await the player during the main campaign called DiRT Tour:\n<ul><li><b>Rallye</b> - The player has to get as fast as possible to the finish line. He's the only one on the course at the same time and instead has to deal with hairpin curves and difficult terrain.</li>\n<li><b>Trailblazer</b> - Basically the same as Rallye but instead of narrow courses, this mode features long and open stages.</li>\n<li><b>Raid</b> - Races over wide and open terrain with many dangerous shortcuts allowing the player to get distance between him and the other drivers.</li>\n<li><b>Landrush</b> - All drivers start at the same time and the tracks are littered with crazy curves and jumps.</li>\n<li><b>Rallyecross</b> - Takes place on round-courses with a mix of dirt and asphalt streets.</li> \n<li><b>Gatecrasher</b> - The player has a limited amount of time to get to the finish line. To replenish that time, so-called gates are scattered around the track each granting +2 seconds upon destruction.</li>\n<li><b>Domination</b> - Similar to Rallye, the tracks are divided into sectors. Each sector gives 1-10 points depending on how fast the player in relation to his opponents finishes it. In addition 1-10 points are added for his final position in the race once he crosses the finish line. The winner is the driver with the most points.</li>\n<li><b>Last Man Standing</b> - As the name implies, the goal here is to race around the course and be the last car in the race at the end with the last car being removed after each lap.</li></ul>\nEach event requires either a different car or at least a so-called race-pack for that car both bought with the money earned by winning these events. Each car can be customized both visually and under the hood with parts unlocked by gaining a level. Experience points are awarded both for finishing races as well as completing missions like jumping over the finish line or getting through a race without any damage. The amount of cash earned at the end of each race, is influenced by the difficulty level. The higher the difficulty, the higher the reward. In addition the difficulty-level also changes the amount of flashbacks that are available for the race (from five to none). Flashbacks allow the player to rewind the action a few seconds when he made a mistakes or crashed and allows him to try that section again - hopefully without making the same mistake a second time.\n\nThe game features many real-world racers including their voices and their cars who give the player tips during the course of the DiRT-tour and also offer him additional challenges including duels and time trials. They'll also take part in team-events with the player, if he keeps them happy by not crashing into them that often during races.",

As a result handling is improved, your freestyle tricks become easier to perform and you can use both of the controller's joysticks.\n\nAlso new to Reflex is terrain deformation which shapes the course throughout the race, resulting in tram lines forming, lumps of mud littering the course and some areas becoming smoother than others. As a result, your handling will vary, depending on what racing line you decide to take.\n\nOnline offers up to 12 player races, private games as well as public in the form of online or local system games. The competitive multiplayer game modes are tag and snake. In tag, one player is 'it' and the other players have to hunt him down, whoever gets him becomes 'it'. In snake, each player leaves a 'snake' behind them when they move. If anyone runs over these snakes, they are eliminated from the round. Other game modes included are waypoint races and a free ride mode.",
