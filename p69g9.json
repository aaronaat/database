      "description": "This is an early home chess game. The standard U. S. chess rules are used in this game. To move a piece, place the X on the board onto the piece to be moved then press the red button. Next, move the X to where you want the piece to go and press the button again. If the move is illegal, the 2600 will give a warning sound and not make the move.\n\nTo castle your king, the king and rook must not have been moved. You move your king two squares in the direction of the rook to castle with. The 2600 will then automatically move your rook around your king, completing the move. You cannot castle out of check and you cannot castle to the king's side if any squares between the king and rook are threatened.\n\nAnother maneuver is called en passant. This move is used to counteract the enemy pawn's initial double move on a adjacent square.  To carry out the en passant, you must advance your\npawn to the fifth rank.  Your opponent then has the option of moving\nhis or her pawn one square (where it would be under attack) or two\nsquares.  If you opponent elects to move two squares, the en passant move allows you to take that pawn by diagonally moving your pawn to the square that was skipped over.\n\n<b>Skill levels</b><br>\nThese determine how long the computer will think on its move. These times are approximate and may vary slightly, depending on what move you did.<br>\nLevel 1=15 seconds<br>\nLevel 2=30 seconds<br>\nLevel 3=45 seconds<br>\nLevel 4=2 minutes, 45 seconds<br>\nLevel 5=3 minutes, 15 seconds<br>\nLevel 6=12 minutes<br>\nLevel 7=10 hours<br>\nLevel 8=10 seconds\n\nLevel 8 is a beginner level.",

It uses the Fritz AI and offers various variations of the chess theme.\n\nThe playing mode most similar to <i>Battle Chess</i> are the Battlegrounds where the success of a move is determined through a mini game (when the attacker loses, the piece is set back to its previous position). The two variants are slasher (the player controls a chess piece directly which can attack, dodge and block, the goal is to break through the enemy army and kill the target) and duel (the fight between two pieces is shown from the side and the player needs to perform quick-time events in order to hurt the enemy).  The other single-player modes are classic (regular chess with optional randomized piece placement), campaign (two campaigns with 15 missions - chess matches with special rules and starting positions- each), various chess puzzles and a tutorial. \n\nMultiplayer can either played in battleground mode or as regular chess matches with or without variations: reserve (captured piece can be introduced into the match again), suicide (capturing is mandatory and the goal is to lose all pieces first) or double (every player moves two pieces per round). Additionally fog of war (only squares which are occupied or in the reach of a piece can be seen) can be activated.",

      "description": "<i>Team Chess</i> is an adaption of the bughouse chess variant. It involves four players (divided into two teams) who play on two boards. In principle the standard rules apply with one big difference: each time a player captures a piece, it is passed to the teammate. Instead of making a regular move, the player can place on of those pieces on any free square. The game is over as soon as one player accomplishes a checkmate or if one runs out of time (each participant has five minutes which expire when it is his/her turn).\n\nThere are three game modes available: auto match (matchmaking over Xbox Live), arranged teams (creating online matches with selected partners) and offline matches (require four participants). Each online match rewards experience points and eventually leads to level-ups. This unlocks some strategy hints, but is essentially only used for matchmaking.\n\nIn theory the game can also be played alone. However, the CPU players have no AI and only make random moves.",
