      "description": "<i>Ghosts 'N Goblins</i> is a sideways scrolling action platformer spread over six levels, each of which must be completed within three minutes (or a life is lost), taking in forest, village, mountain and cavern settings with increasing difficulty.\n\nArthur the brave knight must rescue his beloved Princess from the Demon King Astaroth and his forces - amongst them are the various undead (ghosts, zombies), bats, ogres and goblins. Other challenges include moving platforms, ladders and water/fire hazards. \n\nThe player can walk left and right, jump, and is also equipped with a lance to use as a weapon. Getting hit by enemies causes Arthur to lose his armor and run around in his underpants, getting hit again will cause the player to lose a life. As in most games in this genre, the player can pick up power-ups such as daggers and bombs during the course of the game, giving the player greater firepower.",

There are 5 difficulty levels and optional credits, as well as the usual two player mode including same character duels.\n\nTo win the main tournament, the player must beat each of the other human players, before taking on Shang Tsung, Kintaro and finally Shao Kahn. Players have a range of punches and kicks available, as well as flying kicks, uppercuts, roundhouses, and the special moves, which vary for each player. These include throws, uppercuts, long-distance bullets, bicycle kicks and a teleport feature.",

This remake keeps some of the original game's shooter-style gameplay while mixing in more console-style exploration.  Gameplay progresses through five \"worlds\":  Weedom, Frostonia, Infernium, Enigma, and Evile.  Players blast away at the classic centipedes, spiders, fleas, and scorpions while fighting new enemies like the mosquito, cockroach, and killer mushroom.  A \"classic\" mode is also included, which allows players to play the classic game in a new \"3D\" isometric perspective.",

A pilot must take control of the experimental fighter to destroy the alien warships that just happen to look like odd variations of typical military tanks and planes with gadgets attached to them. \n\n<i>Raiden</i> (called Raiden Trad on the Genesis and SNES) is an over-head vertical-scrolling shooter, based on an arcade game of the same title. It features two forms of weapon upgrades and two types of missiles (normal or homing). You start the game with several bombs which you can use to destroy most enemies on the screen to get yourself out of a jam. Each level ends with a large boss or bosses.",

Some are wandering around in the open, while others have picked out hiding places, which you must approach from certain angles. Trees, rivers and bridges create a varied combat-like terrain and must be incorporated into your thinking. Extra grenades can be collected, and will definitely be required, as they allow you to kill from distance and thus avoid some enemy shots.",

While trying to make a getaway, he crashes into Homer, which knocks the diamond out of his hand. Maggie catches it in her mouth, prompting Smithers to grab her and run off. The Simpsons decide to go after him, but Mr. Burns has tons of henchmen, who want to prevent the family getting their daughter back.\n\n<i>The Simpsons</i> is basically a side-scrolling beat-em-up featuring the characters from <i>The Simpsons</i> TV show. The player can choose to play as each of the four Simpson characters. Homer, who punches and kicks; Marge, who swings her vacuum cleaner; Bart, who wields his skateboard; and Lisa, who uses a jump rope as a whip. Other weapons such as hammers and bowling balls are also available to use. The game's levels are Downtown Springfield, Krustyland, Springfield Discount Cemetery, Moe's Tavern, Springfield Gorge, Dreamland, the Channel 6 studio, and the Power Plant. Each level ends with a boss whose speed and strength will increase after taking a certain amount of damage. End level bosses are the wrestler Professor Werner von Brawn, a hot air balloon shaped like Krusty the Clown, a pair of bouncers, a drunk at Moe's Tavern, a henchman in a bear suit, an imaginary, gigantic bowling ball, and a martial arts sensei dressed like a kabuki actor. There's also the showdown finale against Smithers and Mr. Burns in a robotic outfit.\n\nBetween levels, the player can compete against the other characters in two mini-games to be first to complete a task (inflating a ballon and waking up their character).",

Now trapped in the world that he himself created, but someone else is now drawing, Sketch must battle through the pages of his own comic book, and past his own creations, to a final battle with Mortus. Perhaps one of his own creations, General Alissa Cyan might be able to help...\n\n<i>Comix Zone</i> is a side-scrolling fighting game with a difference, you're inside of a comic book and you yourself know it. Smash enemies into the sides of frames, rip through the paper to unleash a super move and otherwise wreck havoc throughout the limitations of the graphic novel. Sketch himself can jump, attack and use various items that he finds along the comic book, including his rat friend, Roadkill. Button combinations can be used to unleash powerful techniques.\n\nThe game progresses linearly through each page of the comic book, however secret paths and alternate routes through the story can be discovered. At the end of each level, Sketch receives a super hero rating for how well he's progressing.",

      "description": "In a world covered almost entirely in water, there exist small islands that hide huge treasures. And where there's treasure, you can find treasure hunters called Diggers, who live for the thrill of the hunt...\n\nBarrel Casket was once one of the greatest Diggers, but he has now retired. He now cares for his young granddaughter, Roll, whose parents disappeared while on a dig. He had also discovered a strange baby boy in some ruins one time, who he also took under his care alongside Roll. He named the baby boy Rock Voulnut, and Rock grew up to be an expert Digger, sometimes known by his nickname, MegaMan.\n\nWhile out exploring one day, Rock, Roll, and Barrel's airship, the Flutter, crash lands on an island named Kattelox. As they explore Kattelox in hopes of fixing their ship, they hear word of a huge treasure, the legendary Mother Lode, that is buried somewhere on the island. Rock, Roll, and Barrel decide to look for the treasure, but at the same time, they're going to get a little competition from a pirate family named the Bonnes...\n\n<i>Mega Man Legends</i> is the first of the <i>Mega Man</i> series to take place in fully explorable 3D, and is paced more like an RPG than the previous stage-to-stage action games. Rock can explore the town and follow the story to find entrances to the underground ruins, where in he will find traps, feral Reaverbots, and large boss robots. Destroying enemies will reward Rock with health, sub-weapon energy, and the power cores of the robots, which people in his world use as currency. By searching through the town and ruins Rock will find items of dubious use and value, and they can be brought back to Roll to be assembled into useful items and upgradable sub-weapons, although not for free. Rock can run while shooting, go into first person mode for aimed shots, and also lock onto an enemy and circle around them to avoid their attacks.",

There are other bikes on the road, but beating this is not important, so they can be thought of as moving obstacles. Each continent is a different difficulty level: Africa is beginner, Asia is junior, the Americas are senior, and Europe is expert.  \n\nThis is a very simple and straightforward game, viewed from behind the bike in 2D (so the screen does not tilt with the bike). The right/left controls are steering, and up/down are gear changes. Your cycle is always moving, and your speed strictly depends on the gear you are in, although contact or running off the road slows the bike down.\n\nThe Sega Genesis version features \"Original mode\" in which the player participates in racing tournaments, hires mechanics, upgrades his bike. This mode uses passwords allowing players to continue a previously played game. ",

      "description": "<i>Crazy Taxi</i> is an arcade-like racer where the player takes the role of a taxi driver who weaves his way through crowded streets, across sidewalks and even under water, in a wild and frantic race to deliver passengers on time. The courses are largely set inside cities crowded with general traffic and pedestrians (which can't be run over, they dive away). The main goal is to bring as many customers as possible to their destination in time. Available customers are marked through circles and the colour represents the distance and the fare they offer. Green means long rides with plenty of money, and red ones are very short. \n\nIn the main Arcade mode there is a timer that quickly runs down. It can be replenished by picking up customers. While driving reckless maneuvers are encouraged. Players can disregard all traffic rules and customers give extra tips for speedy and dangerous driving, but these can only be cashed when the customer arrives at his destination in time. By the same token the reward at the end of a ride is based on the amount of time left, as each customer also has a personal timer. The city is filled with slopes and jumps, and the game uses a very loose driving model. No damage can be done to the car, so driving as fast as possible is encouraged. While driving players can toy with the gears to perform two special tricks: a crazy drift and a crazy boost to speed up more quickly.\n\nNext to the Arcade mode there is an Original mode, and Crazy Box where specific goals need to be met on closed down courses. In the regular modes it is possible to disregard the usual timer and play for a fixed amount of minutes. At the end of the race the player is rewarded with a license, either D, C, B or A, with S for an outstanding performance. Next to the interactive courses from the arcade version there is a new course for home consoles. There are four cabs and drivers to choose from. The cars have different statistics and the drivers different attitudes while racing. The game has a soundtrack featuring The Offspring and Bad Religion (not for the Xbox 360 version).",

Over the years, Selene grows larger, more powerful, and more independent of the Earth - to the point that the moon and Earth battle in a war that winds down without a definite victory for either side. In 2242, war breaks out again - the Earth slowly begins to win... except for the efforts of an experimental Selene technology known as Einh\u00e4nders: flying machines with a \"hand\" that allows them to change weaponry mid-battle.\n\nOn December 12, 2245, Selene sends down 3 Einh\u00e4nders in a last attempt to turn the tide of the war. You get to choose the craft to pilot, and it's up to you to battle your way through the Earth's monstrous defenses and win the battle.\n\nThe game is a traditional side-scrolling shooter, with rendered 3D backgrounds and enemies. The atmosphere of the game is very \"industrial\", down to the German industrial music playing in the background (think Einsturzende Neubauten mixed with Lords of Acid). The weapon-switching and claiming is an integral part of the game, as weapons have limited shots. This forces a bit more strategy than the usual button-mashing shooters inspire.",

      "description": "Developed exclusively for the Sony Playstation, this fourth title in the <i>Ridge Racer</i> series features new visuals, powered by goraud-shaded polygons, giving each car and track a more refined appearance, while keeping the same arcade gameplay popularized by the first game of the series.\n\nWhile it includes the usual time attack and a new split-screen versus mode, the focus of the game is the <i>Real Racing Roots '99</i>, Ridge City's three heat, seven race championship, with the grand finale in a speedway during New Year's Eve.\n\nThe player starts by choosing one of the four teams available (from easiest to harder): <i>Micro Mouse Mappy</i>, directed by the lovely Sophie Chevalier who hopes to win the first title in many years for the French team to honour her ill grandfather, <i>Pac Racing Team</i>, a recently created Japanese team directed by Shinji Yazaki who expects to create an immediate splash in the Ridge City racing scene, from Italy the RRR champions <i>Racing Team Solvalou</i>, with the demanding Enki Gilbert at the helm, and the American team <i>Dig Racing Team</i>, who has fallen into financial difficulties, with team director Robert Chrisman struggling to provide the driver with a car capable of out-handling opponents.\n\nAfter picking a team, the player can choose one of the four car makers available: <i>Lizard</i> and <i>Assoluto</i> keep the old RR tradition of cars drifting wildly on corners, but <i>Age Solo</i> and <i>Terrazi</i> offer a new experience with their \"Grip\" cars that require more breaking and careful trajectories, but are easier to control during turns.\n\nThe player earns (and so, unlocks for free play) cars by completing races; however, final placement defines how good the car will be. By scraping through the first two heats (the Final GP accepts nothing but a victory), sponsors will be unwilling to invest in the team and instead of a new car, the mechanics will only upgrade the current vehicle. But winning all races allows the driver to reach the <i>Shooting Hoops</i> speedway with the fastest car. By combining all qualifying placements, 320 cars are waiting to be unlocked.\n\n<i>R4 Ridge Racer Type 4</i> also includes an extra disk, featuring the original Ridge Racer in higher resolution. For a time, the game was also sold as a bundle along Namco's innovative Jogcon controller.",

      "description": "The first installment in the Thunder Force series made for 32-bit consoles. As a pilot for the Thunder Force group, it's up to you to destroy an evil alien race bent on destroying the Earth and all of its inhabitants. As in its predecessors, the gameplay is fast and furious, with more powerful weapons. All weapons now have an extra powerful blast mode, triggered by holding down the fire button. Sprites have been forfeited in favour of 2D polygons made possible by the new platform. The musical score contains a lot of techno rearrangements of old Thunder Force themes. In spite of all the changes, Thunder Force V aims to please fans of old-schoolers by not abandoning concepts and details introduced in earlier games in the series.",

You take control of Hercules, son of the god Zeus and a mortal woman, the strongest man in the world and the legendary hero in the Greek mythology. Your goal is to prove yourself worthy of being admitted to Mount Olympus, the residence of gods, and to become a god yourself. You must commit heroic deeds and overcome various obstacles to show your strength and courage. Hades, the overlord of the dead, is making it even more difficult for you by sending fearsome Titans to stop you.\n\nThis is a 2D platform action game. Hercules can jump, grab ledges, swing on poles, and jump while running. He has a variety of attack moves at his disposal. He can execute a basic attack with his sword, or pull out different combo attacks. He can also Power Punch enemies, but he needs time to charge for this powerful attack. He can even slam the ground to reveal secret areas by performing a certain move while jumping. There are also different power-ups to collect, such as coins to grant bonus points at the end of the level, Hercules Action Figures to increase your hero rating, and upgrades to your sword - Sonic, Lightning, and Fireball swords.

      "description": "Mr. Driller's world has been covered with mysterious blocks. Armed with only a mighty drill, you'll have to dig your way down to safety before his air supply runs out!\n\n<i>Mr. Driller</i> is a real-time puzzle game that relies solely on quick-thinking and a bit of planning. The gameplay is a combination of Tetris and Boulder Dash: You have to drill down through multi-colored blocks to reach the bottom while avoiding the consequences of reckless drilling; blocks left without a foundation will drop down after a while, potentially crushing Mr. Driller. As the hero's air supply is depleted with time, the player must regularly grab oxygen pick-ups. Some of the blocks are \"X-Blocks\", which take a few tries to drill through and take away a large chunk of the player's air if destroyed. If four or more X-Blocks come in contact with each other, they vanish and leave behind a small blue creature \"Chisokojin\", which grants 765 points when picked up. \n\nThere are two scenarios in the game, the \"2500ft\" and \"5000ft challenge\" (called \"500m\" and \"1000m\" in the Japanese version), which are five and ten levels long respectively.

Unlike its predecessor, it features 2D animations placed on 3D backgrounds. There is a range of new moves including a double jump, backward somersault and dash, which allows him to perform longer jumps. He also has the ability to boost his weapon, the Cypher sword, enabling it to release homing plasma waves. There is also a Savage Slash attack, with random slashes.\n\nThere are numerous bonuses that can be collected in the levels. These either boost Strider's vitality, increase the power of his sword or increase the player's game score. Another addition to the game is a Boss Gauge which lets the player know how much energy the mid- or end of level boss has left before it dies.",

      "description": "<i>Twisted Metal: Black</i> is the fifth game in the car-combat series. Only on the PlayStation 2, the game includes old favorites and a lot of new characters. The game has a very dark and gothic theme to it, with the music to back it up. Detailed graphics, day/night cycle, particle effects, and a constant 60 frames per second.  The game also boasts a multiplayer mode, with 1-4 multiplayers, over ten arenas (some specific to multiplayer), and a cooperative mode, so instead of fighting each other, you can work together. The game's soundtrack consists of techno/gothic music, with some industrial, and acoustic guitar bits, especially the ending credits, <i>Paint It Black</i>.",

      "description": "Every year, a mysterious man named Calypso sends e-mails to renowned drivers, inviting them to compete in a tournament called Twisted Metal. The conditions of the tournament are anything but ordinary: opponents fight each other in armored vehicles with mounted weapons. The winner receives an audience with Calypso, and is granted a single wish - a wish without limits, be it money, power, or even our reality itself. In 2005, the annual tournament is held again in Los Angeles, and twelve drivers, each with his own agenda, have come to compete to death.\n\n<i>Twisted Metal</i> is a vehicular combat game. The player selects one of the twelve available drivers and takes part in the competition. In the one-player story mode, the player must progress through six combat stages; all the opponents must be destroyed in order to win the race. In the two-player co-op mode, players choose a battlefield and control two cars in an attempt to get rid of the competition.\n\nAll the vehicles are equipped with two mounted machine guns; though relatively weak, they have unlimited ammunition. Other weapons can be picked up by driving over them during the races. These include fire and homing missiles, land mines, tire spikes, and others. Each participant has a life bar, which can be replenished by entering a specific area on the stage.",

      "description": "A beat'em'up with characters taken from many Capcom and SNK games. The game system is centered around \"grooves\" which are selected before any battle. These different grooves alter the character's abilities to resemble different Capcom or SNK games. There are three grooves dedicated for each company, and even the option to define a custom groove.\n\nThe \"EO\" of the GameCube and Xbox titles refers to a new groove: Easy Operation. Instead of the normal inputs needed to do special and super moves, these moves are instead done automatically by tapping the right thumb-stick in specific directions. Only a small part of each character's moveset can be accessed this way, however, and if the player does not select EO then the game will play the same as the arcade and previous releases.\n\nPlayable characters come from the following games:\n<ul>\n<li>Street Fighter (Ryu, Ken, Eagle, Sagat)</li>\n<li>Final Fight (Rolento)\n<li>Street Fighter II (Guile, Chun-Li, Blanka, Dhalsim, E. Honda, Zangeif, M. Bison, Balrog, Vega)</li>\n<li>Final Fight 2 (Maki)\n<li>Super Street Fighter II (Cammy)</li>\n<li>Super Street Fighter II Turbo (Akuma/Gouki)</li>\n<li>Street Fighter Alpha (Dan)</li>\n<li>Street Fighter Alpha 2 (Sakura, Shin Akuma/Gouki, Evil Ryu)</li>\n<li>Darkstalkers (Morrigan)</li>\n<li>Street Fighter III (Yun)</li>\n<li>Rival Schools (Kyosuke)</li>\n<li>Psycho Soldier (Athena)\n<li>Fatal Fury (Terry, Joe, Raiden, Geese)\n<li>Art of Fighting (Ryo, Yuri, King, Todoh)\n<li>Fatal Fury 2 (Kim, Mai)\n<li>Samurai Shodown (Haohmaru, Nakoruru)\n<li>The King of Fighters '94 (Kyo, Benimaru, Chang&Choi, Rugal)</li>\n<li>The King of Fighters '95 (Iori)\n<li>Fatal Fury 3 (Yamazaki)\n<li>The King of Fighters '96 (Vice)\n<li>The King of Fighters '97 (Orochi Iori)\n<li>The Last Blade 2(Hibiki)\n<li>Fatal Fury: Mark of the Wolves (Rock)\n</ul>\n",

The people in Transylvania flee in horror, but the brave Simon Belmont takes his Vampire Killer whip and ventures into the ominous castle to put an end to the Lord of Darkness.\n\nThe similarities to the first installment of the series are also evident in the game's overall structure and basic gameplay, as well as in level design and usable items. Most of the weapons and items from the first game return, with more rare and hidden items making an appearance. Familiar stages have been re-designed, and many new stages are introduced as well.\n\nThe PlayStation version includes a new rendered intro and ending, enhanced music and graphic effects, as well as an easier difficulty level (\"Arrange Mode\"). The original difficulty level from the Sharp X68000 release is present as well (\"Original Mode\").",

Many of the changes in this year's KOF release come in the form of improved graphics, sound effects, music and totally redone character sprites. The gameplay of the system has been altered with the addition of \"Rush\" multi-hit combos and new moves for practically every character. The storyline of the series receives heavy focus in this release with the Orochi Saga swinging into high-gear.\n\n<i>The King of Fighters '96</i> has 27 regular characters plus 2 boss characters (who can be unlocked with the use of a code). Newcomers to the tournament include Mr. Big from the Art of Fighting series, the bosses from Fatal Fury (Wolfgang Krauser and Geese Howard), and completely original characters like Leona Heidern, Mature and Vice. Other features carried over from the previous year include the ability to choose between the default \"Team Fighting\" mode or the traditional \"Single Fighter\" style of gameplay, plus the \"Versus\" and \"Survival\" gameplay modes.",

      "description": "<i>The King of Fighters '98</i> takes a break from the Orochi plot line and instead is presented as a \"Dream Match\" game where the KOF roster duke it out for the top spot (similar to Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, but without the storyline component). Most of the characters from the past four years return, thus providing the player with a very large roster containing 38 characters. Many of the characters have been altered in an attempt to make the game balanced regardless of the player's choice of fighter. Rugal Bernstein is provided as a non-secret character for the first time in KOF '98, and several regular characters have hidden \"alternate\" versions that may also be used in-game. \n\nKOF '98 uses the same gameplay system present in The King of Fighters '97, so players may still choose between Extra and Advanced modes. In addition to the Survival battle mode and the ability to choose between Single Play or Team Play, versions of the game on console systems that use CDs to contain their media (PSX, Neo-Geo CD) also include an Art Gallery one may look at.",

Once again, fighters from all over the world receive a mysterious invitation to a team-based fighting tournament. And just like last year, it appears that the notorious criminal Rugal Bernstein is behind it, apparently returning from the dead to raise havok once again...\n\n<i>The King of Fighters '95</i> introduces Kyo Kusanagi's rival Iori Yagami, and firmly places Kyo as the main character for the rest of the series. The gameplay of <i>The King of Fighters '95</i> is essentially unchanged from the previous title, though it does introduce the \"team edit\" concept which would remain as a standard feature of the series. Using the \"team edit\" feature, it is possible to create a totally customized team using any of the available fighters, or use one of the default teams if you wish.",

When you stumble across your first challenger and are invited to join Midnight Club.  Call other members on your cell phone and challenge them to race across the city.  Winner gets the losers car.\r\n\r\nMost challengers have a better set of wheels than you do so strategy and cunning play a key role if you are going to move up the ladder.  Both Manhattan and London are accurately modeled.  Race through Madison Square Garden.  Jump on to the deck of the Intrepid.  Barrel down the West Side Highway through Battery Park City and up F.D.R.\r\n\r\nIn addition to career mode, you can play in Capture the Flag or just plain race in multiplayer mode.  Angel used the Smuggler's Run engine so the game play, feel and mechanics are very similar.",

      "description": "About 1800 years ago in China, there were three fearless warriors battling for ultimate control over the country. One who sought hegemony. One who sought ambition. One who stood up for righteousness. Veterans who shared the same swarmed under each leader.  These stalwart souls waged war across the vast expanse of the land and, like blood thirsty demons, cut down any and all who stood in their way.\n\nThey followed their own rules, they were both revered and feared by millions... they are the Dynasty Warriors.\n\n<i>Dynasty Warriors 3</i> takes place over the 50 years of war recounted in <i>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</i>, from the first flames of battle in the Yellow Turban Rebellion to the final battle between Wei and Shu on the plains of Wu Zhong. Over 40 characters are playable, both from the three main sides as well as leaders of lesser armies along the way. Each character that belongs to either Wu, Wei, or Shu has their own series of levels where they will turn the tide of battle for their force to win. Each character has their own unique weapon type and magic ability, although they can share weaker variations of weapons with other characters who use the same style of weapon. Weapons and items are dropped randomly from boxes in levels as well as from defeated enemy generals, and each has a range of stats dependent on the difficulty level and the strength of the general. The most powerful weapons and items, however, can only be collected by completing hidden objectives as each character. Characters grow more powerful by collecting stat up items from defeated generals, and doing well in levels rewards points that level up the bodyguards who follow the player character.\n\nMost completed levels can be replayed with any character and any side in free mode. An encyclopedia is included as well that details every event and character from the <i>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</i>, even those that never appear in <i>Dynasty Warriors 3</i>.",

      "description": "This version of <i>Space Invaders</i> is based on the 1994 arcade game Space Invaders DX but lacks the parody mode of that game. What remains is the classic mode that allows the player to choose the type of arcade cabinet (upright, black & white, etc.) as background to the action as well as the versus mode for two players. The versus mode is split-screen, each player trying to survive and eliminate more invaders than the opponent.\n\nThe Game Boy version has both one- and two-player modes using the usual Game Boy tones (black and grey). However, plugging the cart into a Super Game Boy allows playing the game in all four cabinet types of the SNES version. \n\nThe PC Engine (TurboGrafx) CD version offers an additional \"cosmic versus\" mode, where the background is composed of anime-style pictures of girls. They also appear in the \"omake mode\", which is a single-player variant with the same backgrounds.\n\nThe WonderSwan version doesn't offer all four cabinet types (only black & white) but keeps the versus mode.",

This year's tournament is sponsored by the Ikari Warriors in an attempt to discover more about the NESTS organization, and to derail the plans of potential NESTS agents K' and Maxima. Not everything is as straight-forward as it usually is, however, and even the Ikari Warriors themselves are at risk of being betrayed from within by the end of the tournament.\n\n<i>The King of Fighters 2000</i> features a roster of 34 fighters plus 2 unlockable boss characters. The four-man teams and the striker system introduced during the previous year return in this year's tournament, with the striker system itself receiving significant improvement. One change in particular is the \"alternate\" striker system, where every fighter in the game now has another character linked to him or her that may be chosen instead of the normal character for striking purposes. For example, one may elect to use Iori Yagami's alternate striker instead of using Iori himself; in his case, the player could elect to choose and use his old teammates Mature and Vice for striker duty instead. Some characters also have hidden \"maniac\" striker with strange (but potentially useful) abilities.",

Offensive plays can be run from five basic formations: long pass, short pass, quarterback sneak, running backs, and field goal kick/punt.  There are no formations or plays on defense, but there are two possible players (A or B button) to take control of before the snap.  The player perspective is top-down and vertical-scrolling.

To do this you guide Q*bert around the pyramid, and every tile he hops on will change color. On early levels, a single hop will change the tile to the desired color, but on later levels you may need to hop on a tile multiple times or even avoid hopping on a tile multiple times! Trying to stop Q*bert are many different creatures which wander around the board, including Coily the snake, Slick and Sam, and falling balls. On the edge of the board are floating discs; if Q*bert jumps on one of these discs when the snake is in pursuit, the snake will fall off  the board while Q*bert is safely transported to the top. ",

      "description": "<i>Monster World IV</i> is a sequel to Wonder Boy 5: Monster World 3. The player controls Asha, the green-haired girlfriend of Shion, the hero of the previous game. One day, Asha was standing on a cliff near her home village, and suddenly heard a mysterious voice calling for help. She decided to leave the village and to embark on an adventure to discover the identity of this mysterious person.\n\nThe game is a side-scrolling action platformer with light RPG elements (treasure, equipment, etc.). Asha can jump, run, attack or defend (by pressing the \"down\" button). She can also use items and equip weapons and armor, talk to people, and open treasure chests. Later in the game, she will also be able to use magic, and a little blue pet animal will assist and help her on her journey. The combat system is quite similar to that of early Zelda games. Health and mana points are measured in little hearts; as the story advances, their amount increases. ",

As you race through the treacherous and ever changing roadways, the numerous enemy cars will be trying to bump you off the road. You need to make sure you bump the cars out of the way before you get bumped and crash into the sides yourself! Your car also has the ability to jump quite high if you have enough speed. This is useful to jump over enemy cars if there are too many in the way, and must also be used to jump gaps in the roadway and other highway obstacles. As the levels progress, the road becomes narrower with more obstacles in the way, and the other cars increase in number and in aggressiveness.",

To get out, you need to collect all of the gold dots located in the maze. Your task won't be easy, since there are four police officers in the vault who are constantly trying to catch you! Located throughout the maze are numerous doors. As you run through the maze, you have the ability to temporarily close a door in an attempt to block the police. You can only close two doors at a time, and any closed doors automatically open again after a short amount of time. When all of the gold in the maze has been collected, the exit to the vault will open and you can escape and move on to the next, more difficult vault. Occasionally a bonus item will appear in the maze, such as a cash bag, crown, or briefcase, which can be collected to earn even more points.",

      "description": "<i>Vanguard</i> is an arcade style shooter for one or two players. Your goal is to pilot your spaceship to the City of Mystery which is located at the end of a heavily guarded tunnel, and once there destroy the creature Gond. The tunnel is broken up into several different zones, called the mountain zone, rainbow zone, stick zone, stripe zone, bleak zone, and City of Mystery. Each zone features different types of enemy spaceships to deal with, and can scroll either horizontally or vertically. In the mountain zone or stripe zone, you may also come across an energy pod marked with an 'E'. If you fly through this, your ship temporarily becomes invincible to the deadly cave walls and numerous enemies which are trying to stop you. When not invincible, your space ship is equipped with lasers to help destroy enemies. You can fire in four different directions, however your speed is decreased when firing. You also need to keep an eye on your fuel gauge; your fuel will deplete at a rapid rate, and your ship will crash if it runs out. Fuel is gained each time you destroy an enemy, so make sure you destroy as many as you can! When you finally make it through all the various zones of the tunnel and defeat Gond, the game will repeat at a more difficult skill level.",

Each level consist of blocks for exploding and some blocks that don't explode. At times you will need the non-exploding blocks as shelter. The blocks that do explode reveal power-ups and eggs. \n\nThe eggs are the unique twist to this version of Bomberman. When you get a egg, it hatches into a kangaroo. There are multiple kangaroo types, each with their own unique ability. You hop on the back of the kangaroo and utilize it's ability. If you happen to walk into an explosion the kangaroo takes the damage and dies and you continue to live. \n\nAnother unique feature in multiplayer is you can choose your character. Pick one of 9 such as Miner, Tiny, Fat, Cop, Punk (On cover), Lady, Old man, Robot and the original Bomberman.\n\nAfter selecting your character get ready for battle as you are placed in 1 of the 4 corners of the arena. Now just blow your way through the blocks and attack some opponents. Watch out for their bombs and remember to dodge your own. There are also many arena's to choose from. Each arena has it's own twist such as trap doors, an igloo to hide in, conveyor belts and more.",

You can move left and right along the tunnel's walls, and fire into the tunnel. You have a standard blaster, and can pick up a range of special weapons along the way. You also can pick up a 'smart bomb' type weapon, that launches a firewall down the tunnel.\n\nEnemies are all based on real world insects, and range from flies, though to mosquitos, scorpions and spiders. Each tunnel introduces one new enemy. After each tunnel has been cleared you have to defeat a larger version of that tunnel's new enemy before you can leave.\n\nMushrooms can be collected off the tunnel walls. Once you have collected the required amount, you can enter a bonus level. These consist of open tunnels, containing two items: eggs, and spinning blades. The objective is to avoid the blades, and shoot as many eggs as you can. When you shoot an egg you get points, however the ship also speeds up making it harder to avoid the blades.\n\nAt the end of the game there is a final mutant boss insect to defeat.",

      "description": "Trouble in Mega-City One: An unidentified perpetrator has taken hostages, including the mayor. Attempts to apprehend him have already led to the loss of 17 Judges. He states that only one man is allowed to come near: Judge Dredd. There's obviously some history between them. It's time for the toughest lawman of them all to move in and dispense justice via his Lawgiver gun.\n\nGremlin's <i>Judge Dredd</i> is an 'on rails' lightgun shooter based on the original comics instead of the 1995 movie. The action moves through pre-rendered environments on a fixed path. 14 levels spread over 4 stages must be cleared of lawbreakers. \n\nMost enemies are polygonal 3D models overlaid over the video backdrop, but the background can also be shot at: gun turrets and some bosses like hovertanks and other heavy machinery are pre-rendered objects. Powerups are hidden in the scenery as well: there are different ammunition types for the Lawgiver, including rapid fire and heat-seekers. Also available are medikits, extra lives and rockets which can clear the screen of enemies.\n\nNot everything on the screen should be shot at, however: sometimes, innocent citizens will cross the scene. Hitting too many of them means a quick 'game over'.\n\nThe storyline of the game is told between levels via live-action cutscenes.",

Though it's unique in that you can climb walls and swing on rope with your teeth and your only method of attack is head butting enemies - straight forward or dive bomb style. The game starts off with simplistic point A to point B style, but focuses more on exploration in the later stages, which include finding hidden bonus areas. \n\nThe game is also known for its trademark gameplay mechanism of 'spin attack', where Bonk floats through the air if you have the turbo button on. This can be used to float around the level and reach areas for extra/hidden items, but also as a method of attack as well. The game starts you off with 3 hearts, but allows you to increase this number when you find special heart container items, allowing Bonk to take a number of hits before dying.\n\nA variety of bonus stages can be found throughout the game, which provide bonus points upon completion and thus resulting in accumulating extra lives. Enemies themselves can be 'milked' for points in that you can keep 'bonking' their dead bodies and not letting them hit the ground. Spin attack is another method for doing this.",

While the game is being played, star blocks and obstacles rise from the bottom of the screen while the player moves and rotates a cursor which determines where additional star blocks will be thrown into play from off-screen.  The game features single-player and competitive play as well as a story mode featuring boss creatures and a bizarre plot -- apparently the whole game is actually a sport in which children poke a creature known as a star pig with sticks in order to make it vomit star blocks.",

      "description": "Long ago, the Gradius army destroyed an evil life form that was threatening the galaxy. But somehow some of the Bacterian cells survived, and a new army has appeared ready to take over the galaxy! The Gradius forces have developed a super spatial-temporal fighter (called the Vic Viper) which you must pilot in order to destroy all of the enemies. The gameplay in <i>Gradius V</i> is an arcade style shooter and is very similar to the <a href=\"http://www.mobygames.com/game_group/sheet/gameGroupId,540/\">other</a> games in the series. You need to guide the Vic Viper through a series of side scrolling screens and destroy the many enemies that appear (including several very large bosses). Although you begin the game with very limited firepower, additional weapons can be acquired. After destroying certain enemies, a power up capsule is left behind; collecting these will advance the weapon selector. When the weapon you want is selected after collecting enough capsules, you can activate it to equip the Vic Viper with that weapon. Your choices are speed up, missiles, double fire, lasers, multiples (these circle the Vic Viper providing additional firepower), and force fields. As you progress through the game, short animated cut scenes will reveal the story, and the enemies become tougher and more numerous. The game is somewhat customizable, allowing you to set the controls, difficulty level, and number of lives you begin with.",

      "description": "In this eighth installment of the King of Fighters series, ten different teams once again battle it out in several countries to decide which team will be this year's King of Fighters. However, the NESTS organization is once again standing in the participant's way; they have deployed their own team of four fighters, lead by two individuals of high-rank within NESTS: a man claiming to be the original Zero and Igniz, the CEO of NESTS.\n\nThe character roster has been updated yet again for this release in the series. Counting the new characters (May Lee, Angel, K9999, Original Zero, Igniz) and returning fighters (such as Heidern and Goro Daimon), <i>The King of Fighters 2001</i> has 40 normal characters and 2 boss characters to choose from. In terms of gameplay, the system used in The King of Fighters 2000 remains more or less unchanged with the exception of the striker system, which has been redeveloped since that last KOF release. The number of strikers you may have is now fully customizable; you can have as many as 3 characters assigned as strikers and one as a fighter, or assign all 4 of your characters as active fighters. The number of strikers and fighters can be changed after each battle. In addition, the amount of power you can store for special maneuvers and Desperation Moves increases with each character assigned as a striker. A fully active fighting team has only one Power Stock to play with, while a team that is striker-dedicated (save for the single fighter) can access up to four Power Stocks.",

      "description": "The tenth installment in SNK's long running King of Fighters series, and the last KOF to appear on the Neo Geo system. This game's storyline focuses on the unexpected return of the Orochi power, who was thought to have been permenantly sealed away back in 1997 by Kyo Kusanagi, Iori Yagami and Chizuru Kagura. It appears that someone has been tampering with the seal, however...\n\nThis year there are 30 characters, 2 edit characters (Kyo Kusanagi and Iori Yagami) and 2 hidden characters (Kusanagi from KOF '02 and Chizuru Kagura) to choose from. There are several returning characters (Jhun Hoon, King, Shingo Yabuki, Hinako Shijou, Billy Kane and Ryuji Yamazaki) and few new fighters as well (Ash Crimson, Shen Woo, Duo Lon, Malin, Adelheid Bernstein and Mukai).\n\nLike The King of Fighters 2002, this game reverts back to the old 3-on-3 format used from KOF '94 to KOF '98. A new feature to this game that old-school KOF fans might have trouble getting used to is the new interchangeable team system. You still pick three characters and decide your character order before a match, but now you have the option to change to another character during a match. For example, if your character is low on power during a match, you can have either one of the other two characters at your disposal step in and take their place. It also works if you do not like the character that you have selected, or if you are having trouble using that character. You can change at any time during a match, but you cannot when two of your teammates have been taken out, and only one character is left in reserve.",

During the sliding, you not be able to throw grenades, but your gun can be fired normally.",

Under the command of the Master Control, named L-Brain, the Invaders defeat Earth's space forces. Only one hero, Captain Commando remains to defeat the alien armada by entering Balangool and fighting through the various sections until reaching Section-Z.\n\n<i>Section-Z</i> is a side-scrolling shooter where the player must travel through the maze that is Balangool. Typically this consists of traveling through a scrolling corridor and reaching the end where a new direction must be chosen. Captain Commando's abilities are shooting directly left or directly right while moving around the screen. Power-ups can be collected by defeated enemies and include; improved lasers, a 3-way cannon and shield, these can be stored until needed. There are also SMS (Special Transmission Shell) power-ups, which require energy to use Energy units, are used to absorb enemy fire. Loss of all energy or running into an enemy or a wall causes death.\n\nCertain sections of Balangool are blocked until a generator can be found and destroyed. There are four different boss creatures that must be defeated when encountered.",

Clear these stages by driving fast to the finish or try to top the times required to obtain bronze, silver, and gold medals. There are also stars to collect and a hidden item on every stage to discover. All of the levels are afloat in the air, so if the player happens to drift off the course, the car drops into nothingness.\n\nThere are many multiplayer modes, including bonus games such as soccer, ice hockey and a Snake game played with cars. In the track editor, players can construct their own gravity-defying tracks and share them through a wireless connection.  ",

You have to go from one enemy stronghold or conquered city to another, destroying the enemies inside. The further into the game you get, the more types of tanks you can select. There are 15 types overall. Also, as you advance, you can customize your tank with stronger weapons like nuclear missiles and flight ability. Yes, your tank can fly, if you upgrade. There are 100 customizations in total.\n\nWhen in a town, you can enter the arena to battle other tanks for money (to earn upgrades) and new tanks. There is also the match battle. This can be played against another human player or a computer opponent. Another mode is destruction where you keep fighting tank after tank - see how many you can destroy before you are taken out.",

While a Jet Moto hoverbike might look like a jet ski, it is capable of far more: it travels across land as well as water and can use a magnetic grapple to make extremely tight turns. During a race, drivers must skillfully time jumps, dodge obstacles, and contend with some feisty opponents who won't hesitate to bump you into a tree or maybe even knock you off a cliff.\n\nJet Moto 3 offers ten different riders and 19 tracks across the wide open ocean, over mountainous terrain, and through cityscapes. As with the earlier games, two people can still race in a split-screen mode.",

Their attack can also stop many enemy projectiles! Your chosen character must jump from floor to floor, evading hunters, bats, fish, statues, insects, skull coins, and mad bombers! As you advance, you can pick up several food items to increase your score. Clearing the screen of enemies will also net you several hefty bonuses.\n\nThe story is heavily based upon \"Journey To The West\"; the player characters as well as the kidnapped ones are based upon the main characters in the story.

      "description": "Somewhere in a secluded research facility, something has gone wrong. Suddenly the area is overrun by strange alien creatures. Soldiers have been sent to this place with one mission: Destroy them all.\n\n<i>Alien Shooter</i> is an isometric action game in which the player must shoot his way through swarms of alien creatures and complete mission objectives which invariably involves stopping the spread of the alien creatures. \n\nChoosing from one of two characters, each with slightly different statistics (the male character can carry more ammo and take more hits, while the female shoots more accurately and moves faster), the player can start the 10-mission campaign or see how long they can survive endless waves of aliens in survival mode. \n\nBoth modes feature firefights against the aliens using 9 progressively more destructive weapons, from the simple dual pistols to the destructive MAGMA Minigun. Survival is quick and dirty slaughter. In campaign mode, the player will travel through different areas of the base; restoring power, destroying alien entry sites, and picking up cash to buy weapons, ammunition, implants that raise attributes, body armor and various gadgets at the mid-level shop. The aliens are at first simple grunts which have only one tactic which is to rush the player character; however, later on, most are equipped with weaponry and are much more numerous. The game sometimes has hundreds of aliens swarming the character at the same time.\n\nThe color of blood can be changed between red and green, as well as locked with a password.",

      "description": "The 2006 game in the <i>Need for Speed</i> series is an evolution of the gameplay introduced in the previous games. The career mode offers complete freedom in a city with a story mode supported by FMV cutscenes, as featured in Need for Speed: Most Wanted, but now also set in the Carbon Canyon, where racers duel for territory in the city below. There still are many police pursuits. At the same time, the focus on tuning and sculpting your car remains, as introduced in Need for Speed Underground. As you win money from races, you can visit garages and car lots to make improvements to your vehicle.\n\nEnhancements are still unlocked gradually, but the cars have now been divided over different tiers. There are about 40 cars to unlock. Many of them have been featured in previous installments, but there is a new selection and this year's edition introduces powerful muscle cars such as the Ford Mustang and Dodge Charger. Other features include the possibility to form your own crew, more detailed sculpting features, drifting races (introduced in <i>NFS:U</i> and replaced by drag races in <i>NFS:MW</i>) and the new car classes. The PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 versions offer online multiplayer, missing from the PS2, GC and Xbox releases. Up to eight players can race together, in the Pursuit Tag or Pursuit Knockout modes, with a few variations. Pursuit Tag is a race of one civilian car against cop cars. To become the civilian car, you have to tag it and then try to fend off the cops as long as possible until you are tagged again by other players. In Pursuit Knockout everyone starts as a civilian car, but the last one at the end of the first lap becomes a cop and needs to cause as much damage as possible to the other speeders. Another mode allows you to drive cooperatively (up to four players) in a single race.\n\nThe city and the surroundings in the career mode have been divided into different territories, controlled by gangs. You are either invited or challenged to race in the sections and claim them as your own. To do so, you have to impress the gang leader by winning races until he challenges you for a duel - first in the city, then over the narrow roads of Carbon Canyon. Scores are based on proximity. You need to follow the boss in the first race, and he is in pursuit in the second one. There are 4 boss duels in total.\n\nThe crew feature, with room for up to 6 cars, allows you to assign three roles to racers: drafters, scouts and blockers. These are supporting characters you can hire to help you win races. Drafters leave behind a coloured trail that makes it easier to find the way, scouts discover hidden shortcuts, and blockers try to cause mayhem to slow your opponents down. If you hire a scout, you get access to the new AutoSculpt feature. It enables you to modify the height of every part of your car through sliders, solely for visual effect. You can also buy full body kits.",
