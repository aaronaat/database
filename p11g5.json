This mode combines RPG elements such as buying items, talking to the town's folk and searching the local river for the Guardian fish. The fishing element comes into play when you bait or lure fish at the river, in hopes to find a fish.\n\nRaise mode allows you to purchase a fish tank and the extras, and raise a small fish. Much like the many Pok\u00e9mon type games, you can feed it, keep the tank clean and raise the fish.",

The game is played through an isometric perspective on the arena similar to NBA Live '96 for the SNES. \n\nThe game is jammed with all the goods you expect in a basketball game including real teams, players, and lots of stats. You can play an exhibition, full season, or playoffs with your favorite team, and you will be able to customize the rules of the game right down to the amount of time per game played. Although you only have 6 players on the court at any time, all of the usual plays and move are available, and you can sub at any time. There is also a create-a-player mode for you to put your name in the game, and you can trade for any player you like.\n\n2 player support is also included.",

By completing training programs and defeating other students, you're able to gain experience points, which allow you to boost your tennis stats. When you're not playing tennis, you can spend time wandering the Academy grounds: talking to other students, or just taking in the sights and sounds.\n\nIn addition to the main game, there's also an exhibition mode (singles or doubles) for quick-play. And, if you get tired of playing the computer, the game supports the Game Link Cable for play against a friend.",

The other one was a manager game, <i>O'Leary Manager 2000</i>.\n\nThe gameplay in O'Leary Manager 2000 is not only about the management aspects of football. It's a bit similar to Sensible World of Soccer, as you can play not only as the manager but also the player. This rendered using an top-down view similar to many Amiga games from the early nineties.\n\nIn total there is 240 licensed teams from the top two divisions in six European countries. As the manager you get to lay up training schedules, buy and sell players, pick the right players for the right tactics, and a lot of statistics. The game handles matches in three different ways, playing them, watching them or a text-based interface similar to Championship Manager, but with highlights shown in the top-down view. If you don't want to play through the whole season, you can play single matches against the AI or another player. The manager mode also supports multiple players.",

As in an RPG, you choose your character at the beginning, with various strengths and weaknesses, and throughout the course of the game, your character gains experience points through winning matches or playing mini-games. Experience points can be distributed to various skills, such as putting, which makes it easier for you to do well. There are quite a few skills, and no two characters you can create will play in exactly the same way.\n\nAlthough the story mode is the main part of the game, there's quite a few other modes to keep you busy, like Tournament, Match Game, Stroke, Training, and the two-player mode via link cable. It comes with a dictionary of all the golf terms you'll need, and an extensive range of statistics on your player.",

In the intro, you discover that the foal Felix has disappeared, apparently stolen, and you set out to find him again. \n\nThis task takes you through six levels. In each level, you play the part of either Bibi or Tina. Be careful, there are enemies which you should not touch \u2013 this costs life energy, which can be restored by gathering horseshoes. The task is to find some clue where Felix has gone, as well as finding three sacks of horse food so that you can ride on to the next location. There are several little mini-games you have to master to get some item or clue.\n\nTo get to there, there is a side-scrolling arcade sequence where Bibi and Tina are racing each other and where you have to jump obstacles.\n",

She and her friend Bianca are dreaming of going on a riding holiday in Arizona. To get the money required for it, they have to win horse tournaments.\n\nThere are seven levels. They are divided into two types: There are action-adventure levels where you have to accomplish different tasks -- like helping your parents or shoeing your horse. To do this, you have to speak to different people, find and use items at the right location and succeed in some mini-games, all the while keeping a safe distance from evil animals (like sheep...) which hurt you when touched.\n\nBetween these action-adventure levels, there are the tournament levels in which you perform in several different riding disciplines, often with some qualification stage before.\n\nAt the end of the game, there is another arcade sequence in which you have to drive the taxi to the airport. If you have done this, you can enjoy the ending. After finishing the game, you can switch to a \"tournament mode\" where you can replay each tournament to get as much points as you can.",

As mentioned you win matches via points awarded whenever you connect a direct hit or perform a successful move. \n\nThis version of the game adds a health bar that influences performance and a round-based system. Furthermore all graphics have been redrawn and the character selection has been expanded and now includes 12 playable characters, each from a different location.",

All characters have different skills in abilities like spin or balance.\n\nThe player uses items around the streets or the park to jump from or over to increase the score, and pull of as many wild and wacky tricks as possible. The main difference to the other versions of the game is the level design and perspective: The environments are side-scrolling and linear. However, there are several of those tracks side-by-side which can be switched at ramps. There are three playing modes: career (a campaign through all nine levels), single session (accumulating as many points as possible within a time limit) and free skating.",

One is for the direction, but the view for the lure is a side view where the shadow of the fish can be seen as it approaches. It also shows how deep the lure is and how much line is left before it is reeled in.\n\nThere are four fish in the game to fish for - trout, pike, catfish and of course the game's namesake, the black bass.",

In career mode, the player has to complete various goals in each level to advance and unlock further levels. These goals include reaching a certain score through tricks and combos, performing special tricks, or collecting items. The eight levels (shown in isometric perspective) are filled with half- and quarter pipes, ramps, rails and many obstacles to perform tricks on. Two dozen different tricks are available through various button combinations, some of which must be unlocked first by finding tokens in the levels.\n\nIn training mode, unlocked levels can be practiced without the time limit present in career mode.\n\nThe game also offers a multiplayer mode, where up to four players can take turns on a single GBC and the player with the highest score or the best trick combo wins.",

      "description": "<i>Zebco Fishing!</i> is an officially licensed fishing game for the Game Boy Color. It features 11 different lures and 2 lakes to fish on. The player can participate in a tournament and Blackjack Bass. The tournament mode gives you a limited time to catch the biggest fish. In Blackjack Bass you have to catch 21 pounds worth of fish, similar to the game Black Jack. Each time you catch a fish, you get its weight and can decide to \"hit\" or \"hold\". If you exceed the 21 pounds you lose.\n\nThe player can row his boat around the lake until he has found a suitable fishing location, where he can cast his line and wait for the fish to bite. Once a fish is nibbling the bait the player has to hook it and then reel it in. When you do so you must make sure your line doesn't break by keeping an eye on the tension. \n\nWeather conditions, time of day and location all have impact on the chance of catching a fish. Each type of lure also improves the odds in specific types of water and weather types. Somewhere in the two lakes also dwells the legendary Lochness Bass a giant fish which is yet to be caught.",

      "description": "<i>WCW Mayhem</i> is a wrestling game with the official WCW license and twelve-real-life wrestlers to play with. During the matches, the opponents try to perform moves while both wrestlers are close together (basically by holding a direction and pressing buttons with the correct timing) to diminish the opponent's energy. This is necessary so his shoulders can be held to the mat for three seconds, which ends the match. One speciality of this game is the possibility to leave the ring and fight in the locker room or on the street. Besides the career mode (trying to win the WCW title by passing through lower leagues with lower difficulty) and single matches against the AI, there is also the option to play against another human participant.",

The controls follow the traditional mechanics: rhythmic button mashing, if necessarily followed by pressing an action button. Besides the traditional championship mode, the player can also participate in the arcade mode in which a certain performance must be met in order to qualify to the next event. Unlockable by winning the Decathlon is a special mode with three additional disciplines: hurdles (200 and 400 metres) and 100 metres relay race.\nThe player creates an athlete who is saved on the cartridge and can be improved by training. \n\nUp to two players can participate simultaneously; some disciplines also offer a hot-seat option with only one cartridge. Best times and a ghost can be transferred via infrared. A side effect of this feature is the possibility to race against the own ghost.",

      "description": "<i>Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX</i> on the Game Boy Color is based on developer HotGen's earlier Road Champs and uses that game's engine for the handheld adaptation of Activision's Tony-Hawk-style BMX game.\n\nThe player can choose from one of eight professional BMX bikers, each with unique signature moves. Game modes include a comprehensive training section, where in five areas, basic controls as well as all manner of air, grind and combo tricks are taught. The main mode is the career: in each level, a number of goals must be completed to earn magazine covers, which in turn unlock further levels. Goals include reaching high scores (including time challenges), finding and collecting stars or letters, and performing certain tricks or trick combinations, sometimes without any crashes in between. Next to the goals, there are also competitions that award medals when one finishes in the top three scores for a level. Career mode consists of five different levels, featuring dirt, street and vert areas. The free ride mode allows one to practice unlocked levels without limits or restrictions. The final game mode is a time trial: the goal is to reach the end of a special track within a time limit, where performing tricks increases available time.\n\nThe game shows the player's biker from a side-scrolling perspective. Movement in the levels is not free-roaming, but limited to lanes that can only be switched at certain points. Tricks are performed through button combinations when in the air or at certain objects. Performing moves without bailing raises a power bar, that when full, allows the biker's signature moves to be performed.\n\nProgress in the game is saved through use of a password feature.",

It is similar to developer Crawfish Interactive's previous Game Boy title WWF War Zone, with the main differences being the addition of color, several new game modes and an all-new line-up of 20 wrestlers.\n\nReturning modes include training, single matches, tag team matches and cage matches, as well as the Challenge mode, in which the player's goal is to earn the WWF title by beating the current holder, starting from the very bottom of the rankings. To get a chance at the title fight, wrestlers with higher rankings must be beat in single matches, and it is also necessary to fight grudge (cage) matches against wrestlers in lower places. The new Career mode is a series of consecutive fights against all other 19 wrestlers in the game. Also new is the King of the Ring mode, an eight-wrestler single-elimination tournament. Progress in Challenge and Career modes is saved via passwords.\n\nIn the ring, three of the Game Boy's buttons (A, B and Select) are used for various moves, including attacks, grapples and drops. Each wrestler has their signature finishing move available, but unlike in <i>War Zone</i>, every finisher is activated in the same way.\n\nLike in <i>War Zone</i>, short biographies of the featured wrestlers are available from the main menu.",

Players can find out for themselves in <i>Jeff Gordon XS Racing</i>, a downgraded version of the PC title of the same name, with a smaller selection of cars and tracks than the latter. \n\nFirst, the player chooses which mode to play, then selects one of five cars. The player can either test their car's skill in the Time Trial Mode or battle the other cars head-on in the Championship Mode. For each of the seven tracks, there's perilous terrain as well as jumps that, if not negotiated properly, can ruin a race for anyone. Once the three seasons are finished, Jeff Gordon will challenge the player to race against Team XS.\n\nA second player can join in the racing fun, using the Game Link Cable.",

      "description": "Released in conjunction with a 3D version on Nintendo 64, the Game Boy color received its own version of <i>WWF Wrestlemania 2000</i>, with gameplay in 2D and a limited selection of wrestlers and modes.\n\nPlayers can select from 16 wrestlers for play in five single-player modes: Championship mode is the main story mode, leading the player's wrestler on a series of matches for the WWF title, with TV-style cutscenes between matches. Vs. mode allows for single matches between two wrestlers, while Tag Team mode features single two-versus-two matches. In Survivor Series mode, the player must assemble two teams of three wrestlers each. Fights are one-on-one, with the loser being removed from the roster, until one side's roster is empty. Finally, Gauntlet mode is a series of consecutive fights against all other wrestlers in the game. A training mode in which the opponent doesn't fight back is also available.\n\nA two-player mode is supported via the link cable: two players can match up in single matches, with normal and cage matches being available.\n\nDuring a fight, the ring is seen from the side and scrolls in all four directions. The Game Boy's two buttons are used for context-sensitive moves depending on where the opponent is located. When in a grapple, buttons plus control pad directions allow for more variety in moves. Each wrestler also comes with his own finishing move, activated through pushing Select while in a grapple. These moves can't be activated at any time, however: each wrestler has their own bio-rhythm and the finisher can only be unleashed when their rhythm is at its peak.",

The game features the 30 teams of the 2000 MLB season with real player names and their home ballparks, as well as the two all-star teams.\n\nThe game includes two modes: in single games, players can select from any of the included teams and set the game in any stadium. Three difficulty levels are available, the game length can be set from one to nine innings, and team rosters are modifiable. During a game, players will control pitching (slow, fast and curve balls are possible), batting (allowing for grounders, fly balls and bunts), fielding (there is an optional field assist mode) and base running.\n\nIn Home Run Derby mode, players select a slugger from any of the teams, and try to hit as many home runs as possible before getting ten outs. Advancing into the next round requires getting more homers than the opponent.",

Fin and his girlfriend Guppi are walking by a store window when they see a commercial advertising Xtreme Cola. The commercial announces that an extreme sports competition is being held by the company on Xtreme Sports Island. Excited, the couple decides to enter the competition, each agreeing to do their best to beat each other, but to split the winnings if either wins. However, when they reach the island, things seem strange. A worker says that there are more boats docking than there should be, despite their efforts to keep the competition a closed event. Furthermore, a strange gang called the Bonehead Gang is competing, claiming they'll take over the island.\n\nIn <i>Xtreme Sports</i>, there are several different sports, such as skateboarding, in-line skating, street luge, skyboarding and surfing. The player chooses to play as either Guppi or Fin at the beginning of the game. They must compete in various sports in varying difficulties against all the island's competitors, earning medals as they go along. Medals can also be found hidden around the island. They must also solve the mystery of the Boneheads. There are power-ups in the form of Twitchy Shakes, an energy drink that increases the players abilities. Each opponent specializes in a certain stat, and each area of the island hosts a different sport. This means that each event must be cleared many times to beat each opponent. There is also a practice mode accessible from the main menu.",

After aligning the ball on the alley, the throwing is done with four consecutive button pushes. The first starts the curve meter, while the second stops it to select the ball curve.

It is based closely on the previous year's game, with the major changes being the addition of color graphics and the rosters and teams updated for the 1999 MLB season.\n\nAll the same playing modes of the predecessor return: exhibition, season (now with four different possible lengths), playoffs, all-star game, Home Run Derby and batting practice. All 30 teams of the 1999 season are available.\n\nGameplay remains largely unchanged from the previous year or even Frank Thomas Big Hurt Baseball. Pitching and batting are seen from behind home base, while during running and fielding the view switches to an isometric perspective of the field. Pitches are made by first aiming via height and direction meters, then choosing the pitching style and finally the speed. Batting is done in the traditional way by pushing buttons for either a swing or a bunt, with variations done through the D-Pad.",

Rapid Fire has two golfers swinging at the same time trying to reach the hole first, and is the only mode also available for two players via link cable. \n\nThe game contains three extravagant 18-hole courses: Grand Canyon, Hawaii and Mt. Lava. During gameplay, a hole is seen from a top-down perspective. Before the shot is made, the club and the direction are selected. Making a swing follows the standard three-click method (start, power, accuracy). The shot is shown in an animated sequence seen from behind the golfer.\n\nA special twist comes into play with power-ups. These lie on the fairway and are picked up when the ball flies over them. They can be used for extra powerful shots, for making the opponent lose a stroke, for blowing their ball away with a whirlwind, and more.",

Ringside commentary is provided via voice samples of Mills Lane.\n\nGame modes include Slugfest, Career and Vs Mode (via link cable). In Slugfest mode, players select one of the legends and take on the other nine in a ladder of matches. In Career mode, players create their own boxer by picking nickname and weight and setting stats from a point pool. The career then progresses through a variety of divisions with fights against smaller opponents, with the hope of progressing far enough to take on the champions. Between matches, stats can be increased through training sessions. Progress is saved via passwords.\n\nThe fights are displayed in a 2D scrolling view of the ring, with the fighters drawn in a cartoony style with oversized heads. The controls allow for a variety of punches by combining the A, B and Start buttons with the D-Pad. Unlike in many other boxing games, there is only a single health bar that combines strength and stamina. When knocked down, button-mashing is necessary to get back up. In Slugfest mode, power-ups can be picked up that restore or increase strength, stamina or speed.",

      "description": "<i>Ken Griffey Jr.'s Slugfest</i> is the second entry in Nintendo's baseball series to appear on a handheld. Compared to the contemporary N64 version, the Game Boy Color version has a few less features, simpler controls and presents everything in traditional 2D graphics.\n\nGame modes include exhibition games, a full season (three different lengths), World Series and Home Run Derby. The game includes teams and player names of the 1998 season (but not the licensed stadiums of the N64 version), with the All-Star teams also included. During a season, players can be traded, and stats and standings are saved to battery-backed RAM.\n\nGameplay follows a standard model of a view behind the pitcher for pitching and batting, and an overhead view of the field for running and fielding. Compared to other baseball games, the field view is rather close, and arrows help in locating the controlled players when they are out of view. Controls are based on the A and B buttons to select the action and the D-Pad for influencing direction during pitching and batting.",

All 29 NBA teams of the 1998-99 season are included, with five star players per team (each with their unique skills) available for playing. Selectable options include tag mode (for controlling both players on a team), power-ups (temporarily increase skills), hot spots (bonus points for scoring from a hot spot), juice mode (for accelerated gameplay), CPU skill and strategy (offensive, defensive or balanced) and more.\n\nMatches are seen from the side, and controls remain simple: three buttons (including Start) for turbo, passing and shooting, with the turbo button enhancing the other actions when pressed.",

It offers a selection of boxers and options of the original game, with simplified controls and 2D graphics.\n\nFrom the start, the game includes 7 of the cartoony characters seen in the console versions; three further ones can be unlocked. The only two gameplay modes are Arcade (a single match) and Championship (a ladder against all other boxers in the game). All fights are best-of-three.\n\nFights are seen from a slightly angled perspective of the ring. Controls allow for two different punches via A and B, an uppercut (button + Up) and a gut punch (button + Down). Landing clean hits fills the R-U-M-B-L-E meter, which, when full, allows the boxer to unleash a furious punching assault by pressing A+B. A standard health model with two different bars for strength and stamina is used.\n\nThe game includes the licensed voice of Michael Buffer, who introduces the fighters and of course also spouts his trademark phrase that gives the game its name. The game also features FMV introductions for all fighters (taken from the console version), and, befitting the game's title, a cartridge with a rumble feature that allows players to feel the hits (US version only).",

Less of a serious simulation of tennis than other versions, the handheld edition features cartoony 2D graphics and outrageous court locations.\n\nAll-in-all, the game includes eight different players and twelve different tournaments. Only five players and four tournaments can be selected from the start, the others are unlocked by winning events. The starting tournaments are realistic grand slam events: the Roland Garros French Open (the only one with a license), the English Open (i.e. Wimbledon), the US Championship and the Australian Cup, on clay, grass or turf. Winning them unlocks the more unusual locations: from street and beach tournaments to far-out events in the Antarctic or on the moon.\n\nAll events are single elimination, starting at the quarter finals. Matches follow original rules, and are seen from a standard perspective behind the controlled player. All characters (players, officials and fans) are drawn in a cartoony style with oversized heads. The controls allow for a variety of moves including backhand and forehand shots, volleys and lobs.",

There are 12 fictive venues to choose from (gymnasium, street, beach, schoolyard...).\n\nEach player has their own statistics (stamina, skill, tackling, agility, accuracy, power, teamplay, speed and even IQ) that impact the team as a whole. Besides this, a lot of parameters can be customized, be it for teams for which you can change the name, color, composition and line up, or players for whom you can change the name, gender and facial features.\n\nAlso available is a 2-player mode that requires two Game Boy Colors connected by a Game Link cable.

While it features the same style of arcade gameplay with loose rules, it has slightly different features and presents everything in platform-appropriate two-dimensional graphics.\n\nAmong the deviations from standard NFL football are 30-yard-downs, seven-man teams, legal pass interference, the clock stopping after every play, and the absence of referees. Play modes include exhibition games and a full season with progress saved via password. Quarter length can be set between one and six minutes. Players can select from the 30 teams of the 1998 NFL season. Differences from other versions include different featured star players and the season not following any real-life schedule.\n\nGameplay is seen from an isometric perspective. The playbook (same as in other versions) includes 18 offensive and 9 defensive plays, which are flippable. On offense, players can engage a turbo to run faster, and launch evasive moves like spins and hurdles while on defense, the controlled player is freely switchable and is capable of diving and tackling.\n\nThe Game Boy Printer is supported for printing out stats and passwords.",

      "description": "<i>Power Spike: Pro Beach Volleyball</i> for the Game Boy Color is the handheld version of the console game with the same name. Like the original game it carries a license to include professional beach volleyball players from the real sport. There are eleven teams in total, six men's teams and five women's teams. The game is played from a side view perspective that scrolls from side to side. The control pad is used for moving around, the A button is used to bump, set, spike and throw the ball while the B is used to jump and block shots.\n\nThere are three game modes: single match, championship and versus game. The single match mode is for practising playing the game with any of the included teams. In the tournament mode the player enters competitions that are gradually unlocked. By winning tournaments the player can also unlock secret modes and a hidden court. The versus game is for two player multiplayer matches that are played over a link cable. ",
