This sequel continued on the \"eat the dots/avoid the ghosts\" gameplay of the original game, but added new features to keep the title fresh.\n\nLike her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit  while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics.  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.\n\nMs. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.\n\nSurvive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of \"Junior\".",

      "description": "Shao Kahn has won. The Earthrealm is no more. In order to revive his Queen Sindel, the emperor Shao Kahn used the Outworld Tournament from Mortal Kombat 2 as a diversion while his Shadow Priests revive his fallen Queen on Earth. Once enacted, the dimensional bridge between the two realms connects, allowing Kahn's extermination squads to invade and destroy Earth, and enslave the population's souls.\n\nA small team of Raiden's \"Chosen Warriors\" survives the attack: Mortal Kombat champion Liu Kang and his ally Kung Lao, Special Forces agents Sonya Blade and Jax, the shaman Nightwolf, the riot cop Stryker, the nomadic Kabal, and former Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero, who has gone rogue from his clan. Facing the warriors are the mercenary Kano, cyber-ninjas Smoke, Sektor and Cyrax, Sheeva, a female Shokan, the sorcerer Shang Tsung, and Queen Sindel herself.\n\n<i>Mortal Kombat 3</i> brings new elements to the 2D fighting series: multi-level playfields, \"Dial-A-Combo\" attacks, a \"Run\" button to speed up the battles, and \"Vs.\" codes, which unlock new powers and abilities once both players enter a code sequence in pre-match-up screens. Also included are more stage fatalities and finishing moves as each warrior attempts to go one-on-one with the Centaurian enforcer Motaro, and Shao Kahn himself.\n\nMortal Kombat 3 is the last traditional one-on-one fighting game game in the series to feature motion-captured digitized graphics for its kombatants, and introduces online network play to the PC version.",

      "description": "Starting out with just a basic Lamborghini and $6000, your aim is to rise to the top of the 4 divisions of racing through success on 60 race tracks across The United States. In each division there are 20 rival racers, up to 3 of which compete in each race at a time.\n\nThe races also feature lots of local drivers (who can take crucial positions away from you and the other championship drivers), Sunday drivers going at normal speed, and police. Before each race you will be told of the quality of the locals and the likelihood of police presence.\n\nWhen police are in the area, speeding beyond 110 km/h could see you branded as an offender, at which point the police will try to ram you off the road, Chase H.Q.-style. You can attempt to reach the end of the race despite this damage (which eventually hampers your speed) or simply pull over and accept a fine and the loss of race points. If the police subsequently stop you, the fine is heavier.\n\nEach race costs money to enter and your earnings can be boosted by betting on the results with the other championship drivers. If one of you wins, each driver gives you either the amount they bet or the amount you bet, whichever is lower. If a local wins you get your stake back.\n\nLots of power-ups can be bought along the way, including tires, radar jammers, engine improvements and nitro boosts. To move up a division you must take the Divisional Challenge, a one-off trek through a tough section within the time limit. You buy a set of 3 passes for this, each allowing one attempt.",

The last man standing is the winner of this three-knockdown match. Players fight their way to the Elimination Match to decide who wins the opportunity to dethrone the champion, the Masked Warrior.",

A pilot must take control of the experimental fighter to destroy the alien warships that just happen to look like odd variations of typical military tanks and planes with gadgets attached to them. \n\n<i>Raiden</i> (called Raiden Trad on the Genesis and SNES) is an over-head vertical-scrolling shooter, based on an arcade game of the same title. It features two forms of weapon upgrades and two types of missiles (normal or homing). You start the game with several bombs which you can use to destroy most enemies on the screen to get yourself out of a jam. Each level ends with a large boss or bosses.",

      "description": "This is an arcade rail-shooter based on the film <i>Terminator 2: Judgment Day</i>. Up to two players shoot through future and present levels as robotic killers reprogrammed to serve the human resistance. \n\nBoth players wield a machine gun with infinite ammo that lowers its firing rate (overheats) as it is continuously fired. A secondary weapon (missile launchers in the future, shotguns in the present) has limited ammo but deals heavy damage. Powerups inside the game world include secondary weapon ammo and coolant for the machine guns, and are shot to be collected.\n\n<i>Terminator 2: Judgment Day</i>, renamed <i>T2: The Arcade Game</i> for home conversions, features seven levels based on specific scenes or general concepts in the film. The first four levels act as a prelude, as the player guns down waves of metal Terminators across a post-apocalyptic Battlefield, a besieged Human Hideout, and through the security checkpoints of the enemy supercomputer SkyNet. After destroying the computer, players travel back in time to protect John and Sarah Connor, while also destroying every scrap of SkyNet research at the headquarters of its manufacturer. From there, players must fend off the indestructible T-1000 until the final showdown in the Steel Mill.\n\nAssets from the movie are used when possible, such as voice clips from Arnold Schwarzenegger, and close-up digital stills of Robert Patrick for the final battle against the T-1000. The Genesis and SNES versions also support lightguns (the Menacer and Super Scope, respectively).",

      "description": "This game lets you play two-on-two arcade basketball with players from all the NBA teams. Gameplay is fast and action-packed, with few rules, no fouls, and deliberately unrealistic jamming. Players are rated on eight ability categories, from steals and blocks, to dunks and 3-pointers.\n\nUp to four human players can take part, each always controlling a single player for their team, and AI for missing players. This allows for four players to face each other in teams of two, or for two players to team up against a third player with a CPU team-mate.\n\nThe <i>Tournament Edition</i> ups each team's roster to three players, and allows for substitutions between quarters. Shoving players now results in injuries, which lower a player's stats; encouraging you to sub them out and let them recover. Aside from the usual secret characters and cheat modes, the T.E. also includes four new additions you can individually enable from the special options menu:\n<ul><li>\"Hot Spots\" are randomized zones on the court that reward extra points (up to a 9-point shot!) for making a basket while standing within them.\n\n<li>Powerup icons appear randomly, and convey temporary arcade-like benefits when picked up. Some examples are instant \"on-fire,\" enhanced 3-point accuracy, monster dunks from anywhere on the court, or a bomb that knocks all other players to the ground.\n\n<li>\"Juice Mode\" increases the speed of the game up to 4x.\n\n<li>\"Tournament Mode\" disables all other modes, special characters, and cheats, and challenges you to defeat all the NBA teams to unlock extra players (2 extra players for almost every team). Winning Tournament Mode also unlocks a higher CPU difficulty level.</li></ul>",

Each match is divided into a series of rounds, much like a fighting game. Instead of each round ending in a KO, it simply ends when the player forces the other wrestler(s) to fall by reducing their energy meter. Game modes include single player arcade mode, tournament mode, and versus mode for one-on-one multiplayer.",

      "description": "The home version of Bust-A-Move is not a straight adaptation of the arcade game. It greatly increases the number of levels, has new gameplay features and introduces new modes.\n\nThe general concept remains the same: the player controls a catapult at the bottom of the screen that shoots bubbles of random colors. When three or more bubbles of the same color touch on the play field, they are removed, with any bubbles falling away that are not attached to ceiling, side wall or another bubble. The ceiling periodically descends, pushing the bubbles downward. The game is lost if any bubbles touch the bottom.\n\nIn single player mode, the goal is to clear pre-set bubble patterns. The game consists of 100 levels, more than tripling the number from the arcade game. Some arcade levels are reused, but most are entirely new. Also new are gameplay elements in the form of special bubbles: explosive bubbles destroy bubbles in a small radius around them if hit. Lightning bubbles move sideways if hit, clearing a horizontal line. Water bubbles burst, with the downward stream recoloring all bubbles it touches. Another new element is a boss fight in the final level.\n\nThe two-player mode from the arcade version also reappears, but optionally adds a series of ten computer opponents with different playing strategies. In two-player mode, the goal is to make the other player fail. Instead of the ceiling descending, new bubbles are added from the top. Removing more than the required three bubbles at a time sends bubbles to the opponent's field.\n\nThe final mode is Challenge mode: it is an endless unwinnable mode where new bubbles are continuously added from the top. It is played for high score: both the score and the number of bubbles popped are counted.",

What remains is the classic mode that allows the player to choose the type of arcade cabinet (upright, black & white, etc.) as background to the action as well as the versus mode for two players. The versus mode is split-screen, each player trying to survive and eliminate more invaders than the opponent.\n\nThe Game Boy version has both one- and two-player modes using the usual Game Boy tones (black and grey). However, plugging the cart into a Super Game Boy allows playing the game in all four cabinet types of the SNES version. \n\nThe PC Engine (TurboGrafx) CD version offers an additional \"cosmic versus\" mode, where the background is composed of anime-style pictures of girls. They also appear in the \"omake mode\", which is a single-player variant with the same backgrounds.\n\nThe WonderSwan version doesn't offer all four cabinet types (only black & white) but keeps the versus mode.",

A new opponent, Wolfgang Krauser, has come forth to begin a new Fatal Fury tournament. The Lone Wolves return, with new faces amongst them. Only one can be declared the winner though. \n\nThe player can choose one from eight playable characters: Terry Bogard, Andy Bogard, Joe Higashi, Big Bear, Jubei Yamada, Cheng Sinzan, Kim Kaphwan, and Mai Shiranui. The game has four bosses. The combat system is more complex than in the first game, supporting four keys to attack. The two-plane (foreground and background) battle system has been retained, but now, the player can move freely to the adjacent plane - just by pressing the Light Punch and Light Kick buttons simultaneously. The main principle remains the same - beat your opponent in a duel with fists and kicks.\n",

      "description": "<b>KABOOM!</b><br><br>Annie & Clint, two gunslingers, arrive at Carson City and get caught up in a gunfight. It's raining bullets and there are explosions everywhere. After an intense battle they enter the saloon where they dispose of every cowboy in sight while redecorating the interior. Our heroes flee the scene by climbing on the roof, but what's that sound? ... it's a <i>HUGE</i> robot!\r\n\r\n<i>Wild Guns</i> is a shooter with a western & Sci Fi theme. Gameplay is somewhat similar to the Time Crisis & House of the Dead games, with the exception that the game isn't played from a first-person perspective but from a third-person perspective. You control your on-screen character as well as the aiming crosshair (at the same time). Select either Clint (yes, inspired by Mr. Eastwood) or Annie and shoot down tons of enemies while dodging bullets and jumping over incoming rockets.\r\n\r\nAfter the Carson City level, the action continues in Desolation Canyon, an ammunition depot, a gold mine and a armored train (you can play these levels in any order). Finally there's a showdown with the big bad guy. Each of the 6 levels is divided into 3 sublevels. The 3rd one is always a boss-battle. During the game your standard weapon can be temporarily upgraded by collecting power-ups. If you want to create some serious mayhem you can detonate one of your bombs. Almost any object in the background can be destroyed.\r\n\r\n<i>Wild Guns</i> has a two-player co-op mode. There's also a shooting gallery mode in which you can't die; this one is all about scoring as many points as possible.",

      "description": "In <i>Zombies Ate My Neighbors</i>, the player takes the role of a male or female protagonist (Zeke or Julia), fighting vampires, mummies, zombies, and other horrifying creatures. The goal is to destroy these monsters, survive the 50+ levels (not including secret ones), and rescue the neighbors that have survived the onslaught.\n\nThere is a defined number of neighbors who can be saved on every level. When they are all rescued, an \"Exit\" door opens, and the player advances to the next level. The levels range from mall and grocery store to beaches and football fields. Using different weapons such as bazooka or water gun, Zeke and Julia have to kill regular enemies and bosses (huge babies, dragons, ants, and others) at the end of the levels. Despite the horror theme, the game's setting contains humorous elements as well. A two-player cooperative mode is available.",

But all of a sudden, an evil magician turns your wife into a stone! As you begin to realize what happened, a bird grasps you and throws down somewhere on the island. You have to find your way back and to save your girl from the grim reality of petrification...\n\nThis emotional drama turns out to be a rather simple platform game. The short, linear levels are all timed, so you have to hurry up and not to get delayed by the many treasures you might find on your way. You will have a weapon, your old trusty boomerang, which you will be able to upgrade during the game. After a series on levels, you will be invited to a boss battle. The sooner you complete a level, the more bonus points you get.",

Besides the standard punches and kicks, each character can also execute special moves, such as energy projectiles or lightning-fast kicks, for more damage or to create a chain of hit combos. \n\nThis installment in the Street Fighter series is essentially an upgrade to the Champion Edition game with some improvements and changes, such as new or upgraded moves, costume colors and increased game speed.",

Nightmare after nightmare haunt his subconsciousness, and it is up to you to get over each one, so that Bart will eventually wake up. \n\n<i>Bart's Nightmare</i> is an action game based on the TV cartoon show <i>The Simpsons</i>. The player navigates Bart through the side-scrolling overworld, collecting pages of his homework while avoiding various enemies modeled after characters from the show. For example, his sister Lisa would occasionally turn him into a frog, Principal Skinner may force him to wear a Sunday school uniform (slowing his movement), etc. Bart can repel enemies by blowing a bubble gum at them. \n\nOnce a homework page has been found, the player can step through colored doors and engage in various mini-games. These involve Bart transforming into a \"Bartzilla\", a giant monster out to destroy Springfield; swimming through Bart's own bloodstream, using air pumps to kill germs; being attacked by Itchy and Scratchy, the duo from the meta-fictional violent cartoon; flying over the city as the superhero Bartman, fighting boss enemies; and exploring the treacherous columns in the Temple of Maggie as Indiana Bart.",

Well, you might end up with something like Death Valley Rally. The object is pretty simple: Race the Road Runner through each level as quickly as you can while collecting different colored flags, which are worth different amounts of points. When you reach the ending, if you're fast enough, you'll also get a time bonus, but if you're good enough, you'll get a flag bonus. Some of the flags are INCREDIBLY difficult to find, and the fact that you won't usually be able to find them, will challenge (or at least frustrate) most gamers. You can run, turbo run (by stocking up on bird seed), peck, and jump in this wild adventure, as you try to catch the escape the ever-witty Wile E. Coyote and his assorted ACME contraptions.",

You will earn money for each race depending on how you placed (for instance, first place nets you $7000) which you can use to purchase upgrades for your car. You need to find a good balance between the parts. To test the effectiveness of your parts you can run a test race to see how the car works before you buy. Data can be saved on the cartridge so you will not lose your parts or your race statistics. The goal is simply to complete all sixteen tracks; you will get a bonus at the end depending on how well you do so there is an incentive to play again and do better.",

Starting with only a single shot,  5 different upgradable weapon systems can be collected as extras. Upon death, the last activated system loses one increment of its current upgrade status, but can be refueled by additional extras collected. Every weapon has also a massive 'smart' bomb feature, wiping out mostly everything on screen at once if invoked. There are also some R-Type style space shooter levels thrown in for good measurement. Very arcady with tons of action. Several boss monsters per level. Level progress is saved via password feature.",

The aim is to wipe out the enemy, which has gathered around the allied airspace of 'Area 88', in a series of military aircraft-based scenarios.\r\n You choose one of three unique pilots; Shin Kazama, Micky Schymon or Greg Gates, each with varying abilities at damage repair, weapon handling and flying skill, and engage the enemy over a series of challenging missions. The player starts out with the weakest plane, the F8E Crusader, which can only be armed with a very basic range weapons. But, through completing various missions, enough cash can be raised to purchase higher-quality aircraft. These superior planes are more agile, have improved resilience to damage and have a greater range of fire. Furthermore, the more advanced fighters can be armed with superior special weapons, such as napalm.\r\n The missions include attacks on sand bases, the nuclear submarine 'Seavet' and enemy supply camps, as well as seeing off groups of airborne 'bandits' who swarm-in on Area 88.\r\n The enemy is plentiful, and the pace is frantic. Shoot at everything on the screen that moves, and the allied forces might just come out on top......",

      "description": "<i>Spectre</i> is a 3D shooter where the player drives a little red car/tank and blasts away enemies.  The gameplay is similar to Battlezone, and obviously inspired by it.\n\nThere is a selection of three tanks, each with three values (speed; armor; and firepower) balanced out to match its name: Tough Guy is heavy on armor, but slow and not very powerful; Speedy is fast, but low armor; and Balanced combines both strengths, but decreased. A fourth tank allows the player to design a custom variant.\n\nEvery level consists of a large plane filled with enemy tanks, several psychedelic walls with odd images that often flicker or warp resembling an acid trip, and tacky 3D models like windmills.  The object of each level is to either destroy all the enemy tanks in the level, or to collect all the flags. Every level has a certain theme to it, anything from plain green to a colorful blinking eye or images of sand dunes are to be found on the walls, windmills and flags throughout the level.\n\nWith every passing level, enemy tanks grow smarter and their rates of fire increases.  Also in later levels, new, smarter, more powerful enemy tanks join the skirmish. The player has a limited amount of ammo, but driving over ammo deposits replenishes a small amount of ammunition, as well as driving over shield deposits grants additional shields. The three different views (first, third, and top-down) allow the player to incorporate additional strategies into the battles.\n\nThe game boasts having supposedly an infinite amount of levels, though anything after level 80 is almost instant death.  A high score table is also included.\n\nAn additional note-worthy feature of this game is the multi-player mode. Up to eight players are supported over IPX, or NetBios (or two via modem or serial port). The network option offers three Cyberspace Scenarios: <ol><li><b>Arena</b> - free-for-all battles, get one point for each opponent destroyed.</li><li><b>Flag Rally</b> - a match point given for collecting six flags, destroy someone to get any flags being carried.</li><li><b>Base Raid</b> - Akin to \"capture the flag\".  Two teams, two bases; get match point for destroying opponent base.</li></ol>The CD-ROM manual includes a \"Cyberpunk story\", to give background information on the game which consisted of a cyberjock named Hart who lived for the battles in the Arena.",

But then six mysterious crests fell from the sky onto the earth, crests of six elements: fire, water, air, earth, time, and heaven. The demons became obsessed with the crests and with the power hidden in them, and so a civil war started. Finally, the Red Demon named Firebrand got all the crests but one - the crest of heaven. The Dragon Demon possessed this crest, so Firebrand decided to confront him. He defeated the Dragon Demon, but was himself severely wounded in battle. While flying back, he was knocked down by a mysterious enemy and lost his crests.\n\nYou control Firebrand, a flying red demon, and your mission is to help him to gain his crests, and to defeat everybody who stands in his way. This is a platform action game: you fight the enemies in real time (using magical attacks), avoid obstacles, collect healing potions on the way, etc. Firebrand can also fly for a short time.",

      "description": "<i>Operation Thunderbolt</i> is the exciting sequel to <a href=\"http://www.mobygames.com/game/sheet/p,27/gameId,3475\">Operation Wolf</a>. An airliner is hijacked by terrorists en-route from Paris to Boston, who threaten to kill all hostages on board if their mates aren't released from jail. Instead of reaching its destination, the airliner makes a landing in Kalubya, Africa, and all the hostages are hidden in various locations. The authorities have asked the hero from <i>Operation Wolf</i> to rescue the hostages, but only this time, the hero brings his friend along for the ride.\r\n\r\nThere are eight missions to complete in <i>Operation Thunderbolt</i>, and each one has you shooting down soldiers, choppers, and tanks. The gameplay varies every one or two missions. In some missions, you are driving a jeep or controlling a boat, while in others, you are walking while you're shooting. You have a limited supply of ammo, and a limited supply of rocket bombs, but you can always stock up by shooting down crates falling from the sky, or by killing a cat or dog that get in the line of fire. Also from crates, you can get special items like bulletproof vests, rocket bombs, and different weapons.\r\n\r\nYou also have a life bar to worry about. If you're shot at by soldiers, or if rocket bombs or grenades are thrown at you, you 'll lose energy, and once you're energy is depleted,  you lose one of your three lives. You can lose a lot of energy by killing hostages on purpose,  and you can't easily avoid killing them if you decide to use rocket bombs to wipe out enemies. The eighth mission, the mission that involves you fighting terrorists on a plane,  proves to be difficult because a woman in a blue dress stands up and gets in the line of fire, and you have to very careful when you're going to use rocket bombs.\r\n\r\nThere are two endings to this game, and which ending you can watch will depend on the number of hostages you've saved, and whether or not you shot the pilot instead of the mission eight boss. \r\n",

The world's most popular television show is Smash T.V., an ultra-violent contest between two armed-to-the-teeth combatants, set loose in a series of deadly arenas that are filled to bursting with hordes of mindless beasts and killer robots. The aim of the game is to blast everything in sight and try to grab more cash and prizes than the other guy. Toaster ovens, VCRs, fancy cars and luxury holidays are there for the taking... for anyone who can survive long enough to enjoy them.\n\n<i>Smash T.V.</i> is an insane shoot-em-up from the brain of Eugene Jarvis, creator of Robotron: 2084. It retains that game's frantic style of play and two-joystick control method, but adds plenty of gore, violence, a hint of satire and that all-important two player mode.",

Mr. Do can defend himself from the badguys in two ways: first he can push the apples located throughout the playfield on top of the enemies and crush them. Secondly, Mr. Do is armed with a power ball. This can be thrown to destroy an enemy. Mr. Do has only one power ball, though, so he will need to wait for it to return to him before it can be used again. From time to time an alpha monster will appear on the screen bearing one of the letters in EXTRA. If you use the power ball to destroy an alpha monster you earn that letter; when you've earned the complete word EXTRA you receive an extra life. When you successfully collect all of the cherries, you will move on to the next, more difficult level.\n\nThe mobile version of the game includes the original arcade version, as well as an enhanced mode with new levels, power-ups and graphics.",

Again there are new levels and a new story but there are also a lot of new features.\r\n\r\nSuper Bomberman 3 adds in 5 player support using a multitap and the extra controller slot.  The \"revenge\" or \"miso bomber\" feature was introduced in this game.  That is when a player dies they can still throw bombs in from the sidelines in an attempt to swap places with a player that is still alive.  Many new powerups were added in this game including the Kangaroo which in addition to giving a player and extra hit allowed them to have some extra ablity including jumping, laying rows of bombs, and high speed running.\r\n\r\nPlayers are also not limited to the traditional Bomberman.  There is a wide selection of different characters that the player can choose from.",

All of a sudden a monster jumps out of the gameworld, captures both the Psicone CEO's daughter & Zitz and takes them back into the Gamescape. Of course Rash and Pimple will have to enter the Gamescape and rescue them.\n\n<i>Battletoads in Battlemaniacs</i> is another game in the Battletoads series by Rare. Much like its predecessor, it blends fighting game elements (in the style of Double Dragon) with other kinds of gameplay, like racing levels, \"snake riding\" levels and such. There are some bonus levels between some of the regular ones, where the player can collect extra lives.\n\nBuddies can team up and defeat the opposition together in the two coop-modes available. In mode A, players can hit each other while in mode B, they can't.",

      "description": "Konami's Gradius and space-shooter parody series continues with this second installment. Gameplay is similar to the Gradius series in that the player controls a ship that can move anywhere on the screen while the screen itself scrolls from left to right. Enemies appear in waves and destroying all the fighters in a single wave releases power-ups which may be used to choose the ship's upgrade. The upgrade bar too is lifted from Gradius, however each character has different names and functions for their upgrades.\n\nIn <i>Gokuj\u014d Parodius!</i>, the player is now able to now choose from eleven different characters, many of whom appear in other Konami games. They include Vic Viper, a ship from Gradius; Takosuke, \"octopus\" of the previous Parodius game, and also seen in at least one Goemon; Twinbee from the Twinbee side scrolling games; Pentaro, the original \"joke character\", who made an appearance in a previous Gradius title as a flying penguin and stars in his own game as well, Konami's Penguin Adventure; Dracula, star of Konami's Kid Dracula, and others.\n\nIn addition to these protagonists, the levels themselves are full of Konami references, bright colors, and humorous design elements. For example, it is not uncommon to have to fly a ship underneath a woman's legs, chased by a giant walrus, having enemies shooting cute pink hearts at the protagonist, etc.",

This game saw Pond and friends competing in the underwater Olympics.\n\nThe events take the form of various mini-games, usually in the same vein as Hyper Sports, but with an aquatic theme and the humour seen in the <i>James Pond series</i> (e.g. The 100 Metre Splash). More unusual mini-games include Kipper Watching, which involves 'heading' incoming beach balls away from a troop of sleeping seals, and Gymnastics. Events can be played with up to 4 players.",

Only Slowpoke escaped and sent for his cousin, the fastest mouse in Mexico... Speedy Gonzales! Following the trail of the Bandidos, Speedy will enter each level and try to rescue as many mice as possible while chasing after cheese and avoiding natural hazards. Ariba! Ariba!\r\n\r\nThe gameplay in Speedy Gonzales resembles the Sonic the Hedgehog series of games more than anything else. For the most part Speedy will run, run across fields and up slopes and into tunnels. There are also mousetraps which function similarly to Sonic's trampolines and will propel Speedy into the air. Speedy has a short range kick for attacking and can occasionally pick up items and use them at a later time.",

After his adventures in Dream Land Kirby himself becomes the ball, and you must guide him around each hole using the sort of bar system that you see in most golf games. Where this game differs, however, is in the fact that you need to eliminate all on-screen enemies before you can guide Kirby into the hole and complete it. As per usual in golf games, the more strokes it takes you to complete the whole, the lower your score - so make sure you aim Kirby just right!\n\nYou'll find eight courses and a total of sixty-four holes in the game, not including the final showdown with King Dedede, as well as an action-packed two-player mode.",

The background story is based on the manga/anim\u00e9 of the same name. The years is 199X, and the world lies in ruins. Technology can no longer be used, and the land is controlled by fighters of rivaling styles. In this game, you can choose one of the fighter characters of the series: the main hero Kenshiro, his brother and rival Raou, Nanto Seiken fighters Rei and Souther, the assassin Heart, and others. You fight one-on-one, filling an energy bar and performing various attacks and techniques. There is a free fight mode where you choose your opponent yourself, and a two-player mode.",

He decided to return to Neugier. On the way his ship was attacked by pirates, lead by a mysterious demon named Ord. After he barely escaped the ship, Duke found his way into his father's castle. He realized now that the pirates' attack and the monsters roaming the castle are connected. Although his father doesn't trust him, Duke is determined to save Neugier.\n\n<i>Neugier</i> is an action game in which Duke fights enemies by slashing them with his melee weapons. He also has a \"throw chain\" ability, which allows him to press objects to the walls, destroying them, or push enemies to the walls the same way. Duke can also jump and equip armor that can be found in the dungeons. ",

The series would only last for 2 seasons but built a sort of cult following afterwards.\n\nThe Swat Kats are a duo of mechanics by day, but secretly also a group of superheroes defending their home, MegaKat city, from creatures and evil villians. Swat Kats is essentially a side-scrolling action game. You start off using T-Bone and Razor and guide them through 5 different worlds of action packed excitement. Game levels are based on different episodes of the show. As you progress through the game you can increase your weapon levels and gain new weapons. Mode 7 graphics are featured in some parts of the game. A unique feature to the game is the ability to start on different levels.",

      "description": "Based on the movie by the same name, <i>An American Tail: Fievel Goes West</i> is a platform game featuring the young mouse Fievel Mousekewitz. After immigrating to overseas to America in the beginning of the 20th century, the Mousekewitz family has moved out onto the open frontier of the wild west. With dreams of being a cowboy, Fievel soon makes friends and plays on the dusty streets imagining himself a great gunslinger. But all is not well as the villainous Cat R. Waul and his gang of cats (as well as other creatures) has plans to turn this place into an all-you-can-eat mouse buffet. It's up to Fievel to get in the way of Cat's plans with the help of the canine sheriff, Wylie Burp and his non-mouse eating cat pal, Tiger\n\nThe game is a traditional action platformer. Fievel can jump and fire a pop-gun as he ventures through each level, collecting coins. The pop-gun can be powered-up to fire more powerful projectiles. ",

Naturally, such a weapon must not be allowed to fall into American plans, and so orders are issued among the Soviet forces to destroy the Red October. \n\nYou control the Red October during its run for freedom. The game plays as an underwater sidescroller. The Red October submarine can move in any of four directions. The A button fires torpedoes horizontally towards the right and the B button fires missiles vertically, upwards. Additionally, the Caterpillar drive (invisibility) may be activated for short periods of time. The player may also activate a ECM blast that will destroy all nearby offensive weapons. On the screen at all times are displays for Armor (health) and Power (fuel); should either run low, the Red October in danger of being destroyed. Power-Ups to increase or decrease the power of missiles and torpedoes may be found by destroying enemies.",

      "description": "<i>Super Bust Bros.</i> is an adventure for one or two players that takes the player around the world, aiming to rid the planet of a terrible foe: seemingly innocuous-looking bubbles. The main portion of the game is Tour mode, where the player visits a series of different levels representing different countries of the world. Each player's character is armed with a gun, which shoots a vertical cable. If this hits a bubble, it will cause it to split in two. Upgrades allow two cables to be shot at once, or the ability to stick a cable to the ceiling where it will cling for a few seconds, bursting any bubble that hits it.\n\nPlayers must clear each screen of bubbles before progressing to the next one. The largest bubbles will have 4 degrees of splitting before clearing. Many level layouts have ladders, barriers and breakable bricks in part of the screen, affecting movement of both the player and the bubbles. Faster bubbles in the shape of diamonds also bounce around the screen going any which way rather than bouncing in predictable arcs like the other bubbles.\n\nSeveral power-up tokens are also available, offering features such as splitting all bubbles down to their minimal size, freezing the bubbles for a few seconds, and various different weapons. Monsters also enter the screen periodically, which hit the bubbles and take them down a size, and can often be directed by the cable weapon.\n\nIn addition to the main Tour mode, the game also features Panic mode, in which a succession of bubbles are thrown at at the players. As the player progresses, the amount of bubbles required to reach the next level also increases, similar to scoring on Tetris.\n",

      "description": "This third-person racing game resembles Gremlin's earlier Lotus series, in terms of its general look and feel, right down to the text font used in the game. Your task is to race through 16 countries, each of which features four races, with many real-world circuits recreated in incongruous locations (such as the Monza layout in Ayers Rock, and the old Hockenheim in Vancouver). \r\n\r\nThese four-race blocks each represent their own mini-championship, in which you race against 19 cars, needing to finish in the top 10 to continue, and with the top 6 scoring points 10-6-4-3-2-1, and the respective amount of money in thousands. This can be spent on various upgrades, ranging from engine to tires (wet and dry) and from shocks (front, side and rear) to gearboxes. The ideal approach is to buy the more expensive versions ASAP, as you get no saving when upgrading. If you win the four-race championship, you get the next password. \r\n\r\nYou get a set amount of nitro boost to use during each race, although bonus nitros, money and instant speed-up token appear on many tracks. Hazards such as puddles, barriers and ramps are also frequent.",
