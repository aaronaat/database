      "description": "Brutal Deluxe doesn't live up to their name - in fact they're the worst team Speedball has ever seen. As their manager, it is your job to transform their fortunes. As well as the league system, which consists of 2 8-team divisions and challenges you to advance to the top, there are also 2 cup tournaments, one of which is played out over 2 'legs' with the aggregate score deciding who progresses.\n\nYou can play the matches as well, which is the real meat of the game. They consist of 2 90-second periods, and the gameplay is futuristic, fast and frantic, with heavy tackling encouraged to retrieve the ball. Power-ups and tokens appear on the pitch, including ones to make your players extra-tough or freeze the opponents.\n\nThe sides of the pitch each include a score multiplier, which you can run the ball through to increase the value of your scoring - the opposition can sometimes immediately grab the ball and nullify this. There are also 5 stars which are worth 2 points each if you hit them (more if you have the multiplier activated), but these can also be cancelled out by the opposition hitting the same star, and their points values only become set after the half. Next to the stars there are 'portals' which throw the ball out the opposite side of the pitch, in the direction it was going.\n\nYou get money for the results, and by collecting the silver tokens which appear on the pitch at random intervals. Between each match you can spend these either on improving your existing players as far as they can go, or on buying better ones and fitting them into the team. Your original players can only be improved to a certain extent, so remembering where your signed players are and making use of them is important.\n\nA variety of tokens also appear during the match, some of which boost your team's power for a short period of time, and one freezes the opposition.",

Each player is on a dock at the top of the screen, and you control the fishing line in the water. By moving the fishing line up or down, you can catch the fish that are swimming by. The deeper down you go, the bigger the fish are. When you catch a fish, you need to real it in! To make the game more difficult, a shark is constantly swimming back and forth. If you have a fish on your line and it touches the shark, the shark will eat it and you then will have to catch another fish. Two difficulty levels are available, and the game can be played by one person against the computer or two players against each other.",

Unlike the previous two entries in the series, you must venture around the mountain, completely free to do what you wish, in order to find challenges and races to compete in.\r\n\r\nThere are a variety of events to compete in, from your usual all-on-all race through courses, scattered with obstacles and huge jumps to perform wacky tricks, plus there's a half pipe to bust tricks, and there's plenty of challenging tricks to master, and items to grind to gain bonuses. Plus, you can ride the entire mountain whenever you like, either to practice moves or learn all the bumps and corners for the big races.\r\n\r\nWith challenges and races comes rewards, and along with trophies and medals to fill up your gallery you can also win cash prizes to purchase new items, improving your board or improving your image. The more you race the more experience your chosen character receives, leveling up your abilities and improving your technique, plus even more wild tricks to perform.\r\n\r\n",

Up to four players can compete in the ten different events of a real-life decathlon, either in sequence or individually. Included are the 100-meter dash, long jump, shot put, high jump, 400-meter race, 110-meter hurdles, discus throw, pole vault, javelin throw, and 1500-meter race.\n\nThe flat running events involve simple joystick waggling, which must be balanced with accurately-timed button presses to clear the hurdles - hitting them or breaking stride causes a loss of momentum and thus time. For jumping and throwing events, you must build momentum by waggling and then press the button to throw or jump at what you feel is the appropriate moment.\n\nFor each event, points are earned based on how well you do (this can be based on your running time, or how far you throw the javelin or discus, etc...), and the player with the most points at the end of the decathlon wins the gold medal.",

      "description": "<i>Ping Pong</i> recreates the fast-paced sport of table tennis. To win each match you must get to 10 points with a 2 point lead - if the scores reach 10-9 the game goes on until someone has a 2 point lead or reaches 15, in a similar manner to tennis. There are nine skill levels to beat, with increasing abilities as the game goes on. The human player has the advantage of serving first, and as the serve reverses every five points, you are guaranteed to have more chances to serve than your opponent (remember the significance of 10 and 15 in the scoring). The points system rewards long rallies and large winning margins, as you get points for each hit, for each point won, and for each point of the winning margin.",

Like in real bowling your objective is to knock down all the pins. But <i>RocketBowl</i> is different in many ways. It's played in a big arena that almost looks like a mini golf courses and it has both hills and curves and different obstacles. You can roll the ball into another frame and there score, making it possible to take out pins in two frames at a shot. Balls are not quite normal either, in <i>RocketBowl</i> the balls are equipped with jets and you have several different balls that you can buy when you have earned enough money. You earn money when you win tournaments or if you hit special dollar bins. The game contains 7 courses and 20 bowling balls. ",

Events include the 100 meter dash, the hammer throw, the javelin throw, the long jump, the high jump and the 110 meter hurdles.\n\nThe MSX version replaces the hurdles with a 400 meter dash.\n\nThe Famicom version loses the hammer throw and the high jump, but the NES version restores the high jump while adding skeet shooting, the triple jump and archery as events. The NES version also keeps the 110 meter hurdles and forgoes the 400 meter dash.\n\nIf the player wants to go to the next event or round then they will have to qualify, by beating increasingly difficult maximum times or minimum distances. This game contains a two player option, in which the players take it in turns.",

      "description": "<i>Blitz: The League</i> is the first football game with no NFL license in many years - because EA signed an exclusive deal with the NFL, Midway developed one without the license. The game has 17 fantasy teams all with their own look and feel - from personalities to logos. \n\nThe game differentiates itself further from official games by giving the players an off-field presence, often involving sex, performance-enhancing drugs and violence. The game has input from the writer for Playmakers, the football-based soap opera the NFL forced ESPN to cancel.\n\n<i>Blitz: The League</i> has 8-man teams, and makes spectacular action-packed moves easier than in real life. Impressive moves boost your Clash meter, which allows you to pull off unrealistic moves, such as easier running due to Bullet Time, and some brutally tough defences tackles. If these tackles happen frequently enough the players will fight hockey-style, lunging into wild tackles. The team with the most tackles from this gains the Unleashed mode, which has even more gruesome moves, of a style the NFL would not allow to be associated with their product.\n\nAdditional features include multiplayer action with head-to-head online play and complete customization options of players, teams, stadiums and more. Lawrence Taylor appears as the poster boy.",

      "description": "This is a computer game simulation of a miniature golf course. It attempts to refine your sense of timing and your perceptiveness in judging distance. As in a traditional miniature golf course, a variety of obstacles are placed in your path to the cup. Depending on the game that is selected, the course can be played solo, or a two player competition can be initiated.\n\nRather than a full 18 holes, this miniature golf variation has a nine-hole half-course. Your goal is clear: taking the various obstacles into account, hit the ball through the course and complete each hole by knocking the ball into the cup. The number of attempts you make for a single hole is tallied as strokes. While total strokes are unlimited, each hole still has a specific par assigned to it. So ideally, you should make it your goal to not exceed the par assigned to each hole.\n\nUsing the standard joystick controller, you can position the club to adjust the strength and angle of how the ball is hit. Remember that no matter how many strokes have accrued, it is necessary to get the ball in the cup before the game continues on to the next hole.",

New to the series is that the campaign features a story, in which the protagonist is wrongly accused of stealing the money his crew saved for a trip to Chile. Now he travels to Utah to earn the cash back. The off-the-wall cutscenes use alternating presentation forms, e.g. stop-motion with puppets or drawn sequences.\n\nThe seven levels, based on real resorts, are expansive and include many challenges to tackle, mostly involving stunts. For a steady difficulty curve the harder ones are locked until the easier ones  are completed. Additionally there are optional hard quests which improve the abilities of the player character when solved. Besides the snowboard there are alternative forms of movements involved, e.g. a snowmobile. Controls are more action-oriented than in the predecessors.\n\nThe game also features a \"Park Builder\" editor that lets players create their own runs or modify existing ones, it can be even used to change the levels while playing the campaign, and over 300 songs in the customizable soundtrack. Progression and achievements are automatically uploaded to the Xbox LIVE! Leader-boards.",

In this mode you must manage training (either by taking on your coach, or by taking on mini-games, through which you earn skill points which can be assigned to player attributes), sponsors, and major tournaments to eventually become ranked #1 in the world.</li></ul>\nIt's also possible to play against others around the world via Xbox Live - you can choose to play a Ranked Match with your own personal character, or instead choose a Player Match and play without any pressure.\n\nLike the original Top Spin (for the X-Box), Top Spin 2 features 24 contemporary tennis pros, such as Venus Williams and Roger Federer.  However, Top Spin 2 also features actual tennis locations such as Rod Laver Arena and Wimbeldon.",

Get equipment and trainers for your fighter to enhance his look and performance.\n\nThen take your fighter to career mode where you'll play fight your way up from the local gym all the way up to five-star venues. Get trainers to enhance your training and boost your speed and power. Play against randomly generated fighters all the way up through the ranks till you beat them in points or to a pulp. Certain fights may get you a bit of extra money as an incentive, or give you a promotional deal, but pick your fights carefully because strategy inside the ring won't matter if you mismanage your fisher outside.\n\nFight smart during the fight by using the total punch control system to throw the punches you want to by using the analog stick. The total punch control system maps your fists to the analog stick getting rid of the need for senseless button mashing.\n\nYou can also play in historical fights like Taylor vs. Hopkins, Gatti vs. Ward, or Robinson vs. Lamotta in the ESPN Classic mode to play in the fights that made boxing history.\n\nOnce you've got the computer down for the count, you can play with any fighter or user created fighters or any of the ESPN Classic fights in local multiplayer with a friend. You can also take the fight online and prove your the real champion of the world against any opponent anytime, anywhere.",

      "description": "Pro Evolution Soccer 6 enters the display of 2006/2007 with up-to-date exchange of club and national players. Some new clubs were brought to their proper names (such as Manchester United instead of Man Red), while others have lose it (such as Chelsea which is now once again London FC). However, despite the names, players are correct as Chelsea does have Ballack and Schevchenko, Real Madrid now has Van Nistelrooy which was in Manchester United and so on.\n\nControls are the same, but moves and strategies have changed, as they tend to do from game to game. Fouls are not as easygoing as in previous game, but players turning is now too slow unless you know how to do it properly. Moves are much more realistic and goal keepers don't catch every ball with an ease, even easy one can sometimes slip by. That said, it all makes one step closer to reality, while it loses the reality factor on some other sides. Cameras are typical broadcast, tower, and bird-perspective, and cups, league and master league are still included.\n\nThe Xbox 360 version is the only one to have hi-definition graphics and more animations, as the PC version is a conversion of the PS2 engine. The 360 version lacks a few features however, such as co-operative play, the PES shop, a replay save feature and some minor settings such as the ability to create players, rename leagues, edit kits, team names, boots and player appearances, and you cannot swap kit combinations.",

In the previous edition, only half-time and full-time team talks could be given. The game has also increased functionality of the half-time team talk, managers can now target individual opposition players for special attention, such as instructing players to close them down or always to tackle them with force. \n\nA significant new addition is the ability to create a feeder club affiliation. This allows larger clubs to set up a relationships with a smaller club and vice versa. This can be used by users managing larger clubs to loan out players to their feeder club to gain the first team experience that they are unable to get at higher levels. On the other hand, the smaller clubs can benefit from the ability of these players. \n",

To make the game more interesting, players can use power-ups like oil slick (where opponents slip on and lose their turn) or fire that burns the opponents.\n\nThe game is presented in colorful high-definition 3D graphics. Up to 4 players can compete on- and offline; the controls are more or less the same as in every golf game (press a button to swing, press again to shoot). Also included is a course editor; self-made courses can be played over Xbox Live.",

Player names outside those tournaments are fictional.\n\nThere are more bowling styles, including increased reverse swing as the ball ages. Reflex catches from slips, extra run-outs and stumpings are added to the fielding. Batting now includes realistic modeling of shots off the edges of the bat, and a graceful sweep shot. Computer AI plays a more attacking arcade-like game.\n\nGameplay is offline or online tournaments (on PC and XBox 360, a first for a cricket game) with up to 16 players. Players can create their own dream team of the world's best cricketers, or try one of the new tutorials to build up cricketing knowledge.

      "description": "This golfing simulation game is the 2007 multi-platform edition of Electronic Arts' Tiger Woods PGA Tour franchise.  Although the game's features differ across platforms, most notably from next-gen to current-gen, it has a few things in common across the board: more licensed players, more courses, more game modes, and improved GameFace character creation.\n\n<i>Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07</i> on Xbox 360 and PS3 feature more realistic characters thanks to the all-new Universal Capture (UCAP) technology. UCAP is the same technique that was used on <i>The Matrix</i> films to generate digital doubles for the lead actors. Another next-gen-only feature that the Xbox 360 and PS3 share is larger crowds and mass movement of spectators from hole-to-hole, as well as PIP cameras. There is also an enhanced career mode where you can master your skills in a new Practice Facility. The golfers have a new animation state engine that yields more pertinent emotions and reactions based on what happens in gameplay. The game setup has been changed, with different swing styles, and the Speed Golf setting which allows players to skip to the next shot after the ball has been struck without watching where the ball lands.\n\nPS2 and Xbox versions of the game feature a new team tour mode where you can recruit your own squad of golfers to go up against Team Tiger Woods. The PC, PS2, and Xbox versions have the most licensed golfers (21) in the game. The Wii edition of the game features the ability to control your swing using the Wiimote.",

      "description": "The 2008 edition in the Tiger Woods PGA series introduces enhancements and improvements to the previous version without major graphical or gameplay changes. There are new courses (Xbox 360/PS3: 5 new, 16 in total - PS2: 6 new, 18 in total) and different licensed professional golf players to choose from (21 on the Xbox 360/PS3 - 23 on the PS2/Wii).\n\nThe Xbox 360, PS2, PS3 and Windows versions allow players to import photos to create in-game faces on the characters based on custom images, using the Xbox Live Vision camera, PlayStation EyeToy, PlayStation Eye or a webcam. Further customizations include clothing, hair or eye color and more. The initial statistics can be improved by completing challenges based on power or putting precision. They can also be raised by performing well in the PGA Tour, taking into account skill shots and not just the overall ranking. Players can unlock additional golfers and spend their winnings in the shop on new equipment.\n\nThe game incorporates the FedExCup championship format (a collection of tournaments) with rounds of golf at Westchester Country Club, TPC Boston, Cog Hill, and East Lake. The putt preview has been improved, allowing the player to simulate the ball's path once per individual spot, taking into accounts elements such as power, speed and elevation. On the Xbox 360 and the PS3, shots are not performed using the analog stick, but with the 3-point timed principle for start, power and accuracy. Shot Confidence is a new addition, keeping track of the player's performance on certain courses, for specific puts and using certain clubs. Great performances raise the confidence, which translates into experience and better performance on specific courses. Low confidence leads to lower accuracy, a pumping heartbeat, and rumbling controls on the Wii.\n\nThe multiplayer (up to 4 players) has been expanded with GamerNet, where players can create and play custom challenges with their scores posted online (Xbox 360/PS3/Windows).\n\nOn the Wii, players can shake the controls to taunt the opponents with 4 different moves, to throw them off. It can be used to influence air conditions, spin, or adds audio distractions. The controls are available in 3 modes: Full Swing (wii remote), Sitting Swing (new, waggle the wii remote) or the classic controls using the nunchuck for analog play. In Full Swing, twisting the wii remote adds hooks and slices prior to shots. Also exclusive to the Wii is a Miniputt mode.",

      "description": "The 2008 edition of the long-running EA FIFA football franchise improves upon the gameplay and the features of the previous installments. The next-generation version marks the second regular appearance of the series on the Xbox 360 and the first on the PS3. Compared to the previous year, the game now includes the full roster of teams and leagues, same as on other versions: 620 licensed teams, 30 national leagues, with the addition of the Hyundai A-League (Australia), Czech Gambrinus Liga (Czech Republic) and FAI Premier Division (Ireland). As usual, the leagues have been updated with new teams and prominent football countries (England, France, Germany, Italy and Spain) have multiple divisions. There are also 23 clubs from around the world not featured in specific leagues.\n\nGameplay changes include a revised shooting simulation, where factors such as position, defence, speed, bounce and direction weigh in. This is a continuation of the dynamic shooting meter from the previous version, where the position and a shot power meter make for powerful distance shots. There is also more attention to through-balls, more fluent animations and skill moves, revamped crowd, cheering and stadium animations, and a redesigned tackle system. Next to the known modes, \"Be A Pro\" is introduced where players take control of a single, fixed player on the field. It is not a career mode, but mainly an alternative way to play the games. Online multiplayer options allow players to form a team of independently controlled players, with 10 human-controlled players at the same time in a single match. The camera is changed for this mode, to constantly keep the specific player, but also the action in focus. There are also the returning online interactive leagues, with full national leagues against other players on EA servers. The game also comes with the tools to set up independent multiplayer games and organize tournaments.\n\n<i>FIFA Soccer 08</i> contains licensed music tracks from all around the world. Brazilian player Ronaldinho is the poster boy for this version, only replaced with prominent national players for specific localized versions, especially for the European countries.",

      "description": "The object of <i>Body Slam: Super Pro Wrestling</i> is to defeat your opponent in the ring. You must use strength, strategy, and a hint of sneakiness. Each match consists of a series of four-minute rounds. There is an unlimited number of rounds, so the match continues until a player wins or until a draw is declared. The first wrestler to pin his opponent to the mat for a time of 3 seconds is the winner.\n\nYou control a wrestler selected from 12 different characters. Your opponent is controlled by another player or by the computer. If you choose a Tag-Team Match you and your opponent each control 2 wrestlers who take turns in the ring.\n\nThere are 26 possible moves - drops, kicks, punches, etc. Before each match, you choose 4 to 9 moves (depending upon your selected skill level) that you will use in that match. How many moves you can make during the match is determined by your selected skill level: the lower the skill level, the fewer the moves. Players may select different skill levels to handicap the match. The 12 wrestlers you have to choose from, have their relative strengths and weaknesses depending from their height, weight, strength, coordination, and ego.",

Then you can choose if an horse must be driven by a player or by the CPU. Only the third and the fourth horse can be driven by the players. There are 3 types of terrain: turf, mud or dry. \nWhen the race begins, the horses are speedier at the beginning, slower toward the end. They are different for speed at the starting gate, stamina, speed at the straight line, and for speed with different conditions of the race terrain. You (and the CPU too!) have the whip and the coax to spur a horse, and these tools could be useful to win a race even with a more tired horse. \n",

      "description": "<i>skate.</i> is the first in-house developed skateboarding game by Electronic Arts, after publishing the Street Sk8er series in the past. Players can create a custom-design character and move it through the fictional town of San Vanelona. To become a top skater, players has to enter skating challenges marked on the map to gain notability, attracting sponsors and having tricks photographed or filmed. By performing well, spots can be \"owned\", and there are also jam sessions and death races against other skaters. Completing challenges is also rewarded with new equipment, clothing, characters and additional challenges.\n\nThere are two different paths to follow: Skateboard Mag and Trasher, both with the aim to get coverage in different magazines. The Skateboard Mag path follows a more formal career skater format, where progress through the path relies on completing photo moments, demos, contests and filming parts. The Thrasher is more of an anti-authority path, with downhill races, and screwing with security. By completing either path the player gets access to the Xgames, and the mega-ramp, which is a gigantic ramp based on a real construction.\n\nUnlike the Tony Hawk series, movement and tricks are entirely controlled through the analog sticks.\n\nskate.reel and the in-game replay editor allow players to go back at any time and look over there last 15-25 seconds of gameplay and view it from multiple angles. That footage can also be uploaded directly to the skate.reel website, where players vote for their favorite footage. The game supports online play with a number of challenges duplicated from the offline game as well as some unique online modes.\n\nThe game comes with a number of famous skaters, for which the appearance was licensed.",

      "description": "<i>PES 2008</i> updates the clubs and players for the 2007/2008 season, this time including some never before featured clubs. Gameplay is updated in a way that goalkeepers won't be able to easily catch every ball, players will stumble on each other, slip and try to keep balance, be able to simulate fouls and hope they don't get caught by the referee, and so on. This time, the English League has imaginary emblems for unlicensed clubs such as Chelsea, Liverpool, Arsenal and others, certain other clubs still remain with proper insignia. However, their player names and statistics are correct. The same can not be said about a large portion of national selections, which have players with correct statistics, but garbled names and more generic faces.\n\nGameplay is somewhat easier and players won't kick ball so high when you hold the kicking button for too long, and dribbling is corrected and enhanced in comparison to the last game. Modes are as usual: League (English, Italian, Spanish, French, Dutch), Master League, Exhibition, Training, and Edit Mode.\n\nFifty-nine music tracks are provided to assign to play on a specific part of the game (main menu, league menu, stats screen and so on). This is the first game in the series to appear on the PlayStation 3 platform.",

It is the first 2K Sports American Football game since the NFL and NFLPA licenses were purchased for exclusive use by Electronic Arts.\n\nTo avoid the exclusive license, this title puts a new spin on video game football. Instead of recreating authentic NFL players and teams, it lets you create a team with your favorite Hall of Fame legends. Over 240 retired NFL players have been licensed. All-Pro Football 2K8 ranks players based on their real-life attributes, like great hands or the ability to perform in the clutch. The best players are marked with a gold star. You can also customize your team's name, colors, logo and uniforms.  Once you've created your team, you can play a quick game, a full season in the fictional All-Pro League, or go online. The APL consists of 24 teams grouped into six divisions of four teams each.\n\nThe ruleset drifts between the strictness of Madden series and the freedom of Blitz: The League. Horse-collar tackles and late hits are allowed, but  for the latter players are penalized with a fifteen-yard personal foul.",

This is the first in the series to include the extremists of ECW, including The Sandman, Marcus Cor Von and CM Punk.\n\nThe game also features a new struggle submission system, new weapon choices including guitars, and eight superstar fighting styles, including Showman, Powerhouse, High-Flyer and more. Each player can now choose a primary and a secondary fighting style. It continues the legend trend and new arenas, such as Wrestlemania 23, Unforgiven and Summerslam as well as the classic superstars like Undertaker, Shawn Michaels and Ric Flair. The roster largely depends on the platform, and some versions include wrestlers not available in the other ones.\n\nThe season and general manager modes of the previous games have been merged into the WWE 24/7 mode (PlayStation, Xbox 360), allowing to create a new superstar, play as an existing one or choose to manage someone. In the Wii version this is called Main Event mode, and it does not contain an option to manage wrestlers. \n\nThere is also a new Tournament mode with various challenges. Some of the features match types are Iron Man, Battle Royal, Hell in a Cell, Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match, Hardcore, Ladder, Elimination Chamber and Royal Rumble. In the Wii version five match types are available: Single (One on One), Tag Team (Two on Two), K.O. Match, Triple Threat and Hardcore. It does not have the WWE Shop and a smaller move list, but includes Mii integration (menu screens and in-game HUD) as well as motion-sensing attacks based on the controls.\n\nThe Xbox 360 versions allows players to use custom music during entrances while the PS3 version offers a first-person view during those sequences. Both are the only ones to offer online multiplayer.",

Unlike previous games of Monster Jam franchise, Monster Jam includes 20 pre-existing trucks licensed specifically for the game by USHRA (United States Hot Rod Association). The game includes such well-known monster trucks as Destroyer, Bounty Hunter, Blue Thunder, Captain's Cruise, it's previous identity - Bulldozer and probably two of the most alleged kings of all monster trucks - Maximum Destruction, the winner of seven Monster Jam World Finals and Grave Digger, one of the most influential monster trucks of all time .\n\nAt the beginning of the game only a small amount of trucks and tracks is available for choosing. The player is encouraged to participate in various events to attain career points which will unlock new items. The amount of points given depend on the player's performance in the following events:\n<ul>\n<li> <b>Freestyle</b> - a classic monster truck challenge involves free-riding at the arena performing different stunts and interacting with the surrounding environment in the most destructive way possible. In this challenge it is advisable to \"keep the action going\" until the time runs out. Also, a combo of different stunts in a succession will result in magnifying the score.</li>\n\n<li><b>Track Circuit</b> - an offroad lap-based racing through various types of countryside.</li>\n\n<li><b>Eliminator</b> - is the classic knock-out race in which  each lap eliminates the last truck to complete it.</li>\n\n<li><b>Stadium Circuit</b> - is the same as Track Circuit with the action taking the place in the arena, and not at outdoors locations and the trucks competing at different tracks separated from each other.</li>\n\n<li><b>Stadium Racing</b> - is a drag racing challenge in which players should boost their maximum speed in order to arrive first at the finish of a short un-circled track.</li>\n</ul>\nOnce the sufficient number points is achieved the player will be allowed to participate in Monster Jam World Finals to prove his right to be the ultimate champion of Monster Jam.\n\nThe game makes heavy emphasis on it's fully destructible levels. Nearly everything player meets on the track may be crushed, moved or destroyed. The game encourages such kind of behavior by issuing additional points and allowing player to use \"nitro boost\" for a prolonged amount of time.\n\nThe game may be played in two difficulty modes: \"Normal\" - is enough for everyone, while \"Pro\" is meant for die-hard Monster Truck enthusiasts only.

These motion controls include drumming the remote and nunchuk when trying to speed up and using the remote as a bat when hitting.\n\nInstead of a traditional season mode as in many other baseball simulations, in <i>The BIGS</i> there is a mode titled Rookie Challenge, where the player creates a ballplayer and tries to lead him and his team to the World Series. Another mode, Home Run Pinball, puts a hitter in the middle of Times Square, New York, with the aim to hit balls into windows and neon lights.",

      "description": "Sega's many franchises come together for a tennis tournament spanning the varied worlds created by them in the last twenty years. Sixteen characters over fifteen different Sega game series are represented, as are ten different courts based on those same franchises.\n\nExhibition and Tournament modes are included in the game. The first is a simple vs mode, whereas the tournament allows the player to unlock new characters and courts over a series of matches and other challenges, all related to tennis but also drawing heavily on the video game represented. Singles and doubles can be played by either humans or AI, with the player being able to choose his or her doubles partner.\n\nVersion differences are notable, as the Wii game misses out on online play in exchange for three different control modes utilising the Wii Remote (much like in Wii Sports tennis, the Wii Remote and nunchuck or the Classic Controller. Online play is included in the 360 and PS3 versions.\n\nEach character has a special move to aid them with their tennis match, relating to the character. For example, Beat from Jet Set Radio has a power that allows the ball to grind against the net and shoot off at a random point, making it difficult to return. \n\nMinigames are included as both one-offs and part of the tournament. These include a Target-hitting game, The House of the Dead zombie killing game (hit moving zombies around a court before the timer runs out), a Space Harrier game, a Puyo Puyo game, a Virtua Cop game and a Samba De Amigo-related game.",

This time it's basically FIFA 08 modified to let the player experience this summer's European Championship. \n\nEuro 2008 lets you control any European national football team in many different ways. For example you can decide to create your own character and play as good as possible on your position on the field in order to become good enough to captain your team. This is basically a slightly modified version of the \"be a pro\"-mode from FIFA 08.\n\nYou can also try different challenges and tournament modes in order to unlock extras or just test your abilities. You can play through the full championship experience, including the qualifying stages, or you can skip ahead to the group stages. You can also play a very extensive challenge mode where you try to make you nation the best in European football by clearing different challenges against all the other European teams. \n\nAs with FIFA 08 the PC and console versions are quite different. In fact, they are based on completely different game engines. While the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3-versions boasts state of the art graphics and a new and improved control system, the PC-version still basically looks and functions like the 2006-version.",

The 2K7 edition has an all-new fielding and baseruninng A.I. system that simplifies the control allowing you to take control of each baserunner individually. New to this year too, is the pennant fever mode, in which you can take your favorite franchise all the way to the World Series Championship during the most intense part of the MLB season.\n\n'The Farm' has been added to the Franchise mode, where aspiring owners can now scout and evaluate minor league players by playing full games with AAA clubs. Besides that, both the graphics engine as the MLB roster has been updated.\n\nAlso present is Inside Edge from last year's instalment, where player abilities are boosted through strength. 150 animations were added to mimic real-life stars based on signature style. The fielding has been redesigned, there is a dynamic throwing system and online play for the 360 and PS3 version. In a mini-game, the player can have the manager argue with the umpire by tapping a button.",

      "description": "Another update of EA's perennial NCAA collegiate football franchise, this edition features updated rosters and stats. It also has new features such as a momentum meter, the more players either in favor or against a team, the more the meter will light up or darken, affecting the teams morale and success of plays. It also has a new kicking meter along with spring drills, letting players update their stats along with a new Spring Game where players can scout out their new players in exhibition games.\n\nAside from the PSP version, Campus Legend is also a novelty - an update of the Race for the Heisman mode of the previous edition and it is quite similar to the NFL Superstar mode from the Madden franchise. A new player starts at football camp, practises and is eventually awarded a scholarship to play in a division. Rather than a single drill, it is now a series of four. Where in the previous version players could choose a scholarship, the game now offers a selection from the available schools based on the performances. Once enrolled, players choose a major, follow progress reports, read headlines in the school newspaper and have a dorm room where fan mail arrives. The player's girlfriend, shown as a photo of the wall, becomes more beautiful based on the success in the games. Days consist of attending classes, practice, studying, meeting tutors, drills or social activities. These can also boost popularity and overall success. Characters can be uploaded to Madden 07 where it can determine their draft position. The game is also aligned with ESPN, updating with real news from ESPN Radio and ESPN.com. It features the voice talents of Lee Corso, Brad Nessler and Kirk Herbstreit.\n\nThe 360 version lacks the Spring Drills and Campus Legend modes. Instead it has improved graphics and a series of mini-games.",

      "description": "The third game in the Top Spin series updates the concept of the previous two tennis titles with some new features. The most important change is that more control is given back to the player, levelling the difficulty. In the previous version the AI took control of timing and positing, players only needed to press a button for shots, and keeping it pressed longer made them harder. In this edition the player controls the power of the shot, the positioning of the player and the timing needed to perform a successful swing. When the player needs to run to reach the ball, it will never be as precise as powerful as when already in position. Most of these changes are gradually introduced in the tennis school, where players are trained to become familiar with the new controls.\n\nThere are about twenty professional players, modelled after their real-like counterparts and with signature styles. Famous players such as Roger Federer and Justine Henin are present, along with a few legends such as Boris Becker, Bj\u00f6rn Borg and Monica Seles. Not all legends are available at the same time for all three platforms (including Wii). An editor is included to design custom characters. There are dynamic weather changes and the players' costumes show traces of grass or dirt as the match progresses. In the same vein, the player faces show how they are sweating after playing for some time.\n\nNext to regular matches, there is a full career mode where the player starts with very low statistics. These can be upgraded by training and playing matches, but they can never all be pushed to the maximum. Instead players need to choose to train for some powerful abilities or decide to become a more all-round player. This is mostly reflected in the amount of winners based on forehands or backhands for instance.\n\nAlong with quick matches, the world tour is also supported online. The world ranking starts over every fortnight and is not continued endlessly like the previous version. Some of the tournaments are the US Open, Australian Open en Roland Garros, but Wimbledon has not been included. There are various difficulty levels, six camera modes and the graphics are more detailed than the previous versions.",

      "description": "The official game of the Games of the XXIX Olympiad, <i>Beijing 2008</i> features 32 national teams in 38 events for both men and women on a varied number of disciplines, played in truthful representations of the stadiums that hosted the real Games in the summer of 2008 such as the Birds' Nest or the Watercube.\n\nAs usual with games in this genre (some events play in a particular similar fashion to Athens 2004), button mashing and timing makes up the core of the gameplay, with some exceptions and novel ideas. In now-classic events such as sprinting running and swimming, instead of mashing the power buttons as soon as the starting pistol is heard, the player has to control a bar with the trigger buttons, where the player jumps from the blocks when it is completely filled and has to be careful not to fill the bar too soon (resulting in a false start) or too late (losing precious time). Other events also have their share of gameplay innovations in the genre, such as the Javelin, where the analogue stick is used to set the throw and accurately define the angle accurately. \nIn the most off-beat events, diving and rings requires the player to follow the on-screen cue with the analogue pads, while others such as the the floor exercise and beam require the player to follow the button queues - there are three difficulty levels, mostly changing the looseness of the timing - in higher levels, the player will have a much harder time hitting \"perfect\" moves and some of them will require much faster combinations.\n\nOne of the most novel events is Judo, where the player must react quickly to the on-screen cues in order to gain advantage during the grappling phase - once there's an opening chance for an attack, the player can press one button to initiate a throw, and if the mis-match was large enough (a \"Perfect\" against a \"Very Good\" won't allow for an <i>Ippon</i> throw, and the defending player with block the attack, starting another grappling sequence). The player being thrown must bash the appropriate button to decrease the power bar to avoid being projected with his back down, which would result on an <i>Ippon</i> and instant defeat. While an <i>Ippon</i> decides the match instantly, two <i>Waza-ari</i> also decide, with the lowest scores (<i>Koka</i> and <i>Yuko</i>) usually deciding matches stopped by the clock. The player can also choose to do a choke or lock move, where both players must press the triggers, and unless the defending player does not break the lock in a limited time frame, he concedes an <i>Ippon</i> and loses the match.\nTable Tennis also makes an appearance, and is an event where the player must be properly placed to respond with either a well-timed normal or backspin shot, the timing defining the accuracy of the shot. Good returns fill a power bar, and once it's filled, the player can do a particularly vicious shot that when well executed is nearly impossible to return - however, being able to return these shots becomes the essence of each set, same with doing perfect serves.\n\nGame modes include practice, regular competition (where the player can select or deselect each event, for men and women), random events, Decathlon or Heptathlon and of course, the Olympics. While in previous games the Olympics were usually just a set of events, in <i>Beijing 2008</i> they are much more complex, and feature a game where the player must complete a number of challenges each day with the difficulty level and number of necessary successes increasing progressively. While in the other modes there is a slight slowdown during the technical parts of the events, in Olympic the player must assign points to it, and trigger when required. The player also needs to assign points to other key areas, such as speed, technique or accuracy. Failing to reach the goal for the day forces the player to load the game and try again.",

      "description": "<i>NHL 2K9</i> is 2K Sports' entry into Hockey gaming for the 2008-2009 season. The game is built on the same engine that many of the previous 2K hockey games used, and features include Season, Franchise, 2-on-2 Mini Rink, 4-on-4 Pond Hockey, and Shootout modes. Season Mode allows you to take basic control over an NHL team and guide them through an entire 82-game schedule, as well as (if you're good enough) the playoffs. Franchise is like Season Mode, but much deeper. In it, you guide a team through multiple seasons of hockey, and have control of options like drafting, contract signings, free agency, and hiring staff. The 2-on-2 and 4-on4 modes allow you and a friend to hand-pick a team of players (3 or 5, depending on the mode) and face off in a wide-open, arcade-style hockey game. Shootout works exactly like a shootout in real hockey: three skaters per side alternate taking shots at the goaltender, and most goals wins. Aside from game play modes, you also have the option of creating your own player or your own team from scratch, as well as modifying the existing roster (ie make trades, edit line combination) to your taste.\n\nNHL 2K9 is the first NHL Sports title for the Nintendo Wii. The Wii version features motion controls for shooting, passing, checking, and even fighting. There's also a new system for those who like to take control of the goaltender, which involves mimicking controller movements as they flash up on the screen in order to make saves. \n\nThe PS3 and XBOX 360 version include online play, in which you can jump into a quick game with up to 11 other players, or participate in online leagues or tournaments.\n\nIn the broadcast booth, Bob Cole and Harry Neal have been replaced by the San Jose Sharks' announcing team of Randy Hann and Drew Remenda. The game soundtrack mainly comprised of energetic rock tunes, and features the likes of The Offspring, Bad Religion, and Mastodon.",

Each wrestler comes alive thanks to their participation in motion capturing and allowing actual scans of themselves to be used for the game in place of hand-painted textures for extra realism and detail.\n\nTNA iMPACT tries to revive the older arcade style of wrestling game and is more about fast paced action while still offering multiple match types such as Standard, Tag Team, Free For All, Ultimate X, Submission, Handicap, and Falls Count anywhere. In addition to this you can play alone, or compete against your friends at home, or online\n\nThere is also a story mode in which you create your very own TNA wrestler with customisable costumes, move sets and such as you unfold the back-story of a former champion wrestler.\n\n(unfortunately due to limitations with the PS2 and Wii create-a-wrestler and online functions are not available)",

Players can also control their team in the offseason, tracking future players in the <i>NFL Draft</i>.\n\nPlayers can also go online and share their playbook for others to view as well as compete head-to-head, coaching their team against their opponents.",

One of which is where players can switch to other players on offense besides the ball handler and set up alley-oops and set up screens to fool defenses.  Players can also use the right analog stick for defensive purposes, locking onto opponents and run defensive plays against them.  There is also Signature Style, giving the NBA players in the game and more life-like and fluid feel to them.\n\nThere is also a Slam Dunk Contest sponsored by Sprite with the ability to use over 300 different dunk variations as well as compete against four other opponents online.  Music in the game is provided by well-know rappers such as Q-Tip, Run-DMC, Percee P among many others.",

      "description": "Step into the ring with a cast of quirky cartoon characters, just waiting to beat the stuffing out of you!  <i>Facebreaker</i> is an arcade-style boxing game where you and your opponent duke it out in a set of three rounds until one of you is knocked out.  If a winner is not decided after three rounds, the game goes into 'Sudden Death' mode, and the first person to KO wins.  The game also has a difficult to perform 'Facebreaker' move - if you perform this move on your opponent, you instantly win the match.\n\nYou can throw low punches and high punches, grab your opponent, or perform a strong attack.  By repeatedly attacking with low or high punches, you'll build up your 'Breaker Meter'.  If you hit with a strong attack when the Breaker Meter is filled, you'll perform a Hay, Bone, Ground, Sky or Facebreaker - depending on how full it is.  You can also use the shoulder button to block.  If you block and use your low or high punch before your opponent hits you, you'll perform a Parry, which counters their oncoming attack.\n\nThe game also allows you to custom-create your own boxers.  You can do this either just by using the game's editor on its own, or, if you have a camera, you can take a photo and the editor can use that as a starting point for your fighter.  You can even upload and download other custom-created boxers to see other people's creations!",
