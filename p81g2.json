      "description": "You have just stumbled upon a most intriguing book, a book titled Myst. You have no idea where it came from, who wrote it, or how old it is. Reading through its pages provides you with only a description of an island world. But it's just a book, isn't it? As you reach the end of the book, you lay your hand on a page. Suddenly your own world dissolves into blackness, replaced with the island world the pages described. Now you're here, wherever here is, with no option but to explore.\n\n<i>Myst</i> is a first-person point-and-click adventure where the player controls a character known as The Stranger. Magically transported into the world described in the book, he needs to explore Myst Island and solve its mysteries. The game is presented as a series of static scenes where the player acts with the environment by clicking and manipulating objects. There are no enemies and it is not possible to die. Through Myst Island, the game is further divided into mini-worlds set in different ages accessed through different books. \n\nThe game's interface is reduced to a single cursor for navigation and interaction. Rather than collecting items and using them to solve puzzles, the player must gather subtly placed clues and manipulate complex mechanical devices in order to advance in the game. The world of <i>Myst</i> is mostly uninhabited, and the game has very few live-action scenes with characters and dialogue.",

The factory's ambitions, however, are ill-suited to the contemporary economic climate, and the elderly Anna Voralberg, at the helm of the Valadilene factory for more than half a century, has decided to sell up. \n\nIt turns out that the takeover might not be as straightforward as expected. The day that Kate Walker arrives, Anna Voralberg is being buried. What is more is that she has left an heir \u2013 her brother Hans. But Hans had left the valley at the end of the thirties and never returned, and was actually believed to be dead. However, a letter written by Anna in the days leading up to her death reveals that Hans is well and truly alive and living somewhere in Siberia. Valadilene's elderly notary entrusted to take care of Anna's affairs suggests that Kate find Hans Voralberg as he is now the only person in a position to ratify the sale of the family business. \n\n<i>Syberia</i> is a traditional puzzle-solving adventure. The player navigates a 3D model of the protagonist over pre-rendered backgrounds with fixed camera angles. Puzzles are mostly inventory-based, though some involve manipulating the environment (such as mechanical devices). The interface features a single cursor; only highlighted objects can be interacted with, and there are no verb choice commands.",

      "description": "In the year 2010 mankind has built its first space colony, Beyond Coast. Three years later the founders of the colony felt it needed to be protected, and chose five best policemen from Earth to do that: Gates Becker from Scotland Yard, the Japanese Sadaoki Tokugawa, Salvatore Toscanini from New York, and two policemen from Los Angeles: Jonathan Ingram and his best friend Ed Brown. During a routine patrol on Beyond Coast, something happened to Jonathan's space suit. He was sucked into space and presumed dead. Twenty-five years later, he is miraculously discovered in his life pod, alive. He still looks like a young man, but in reality he is fifty-five years old.\n\nTrying to forget his past, Jonathan opens an investigation agency on Earth. One day, his ex-wife unexpectedly pays him a visit. She has re-married during Jonathan's prolonged absence, and asks him to find her missing husband. When she leaves the office, her car explodes, and she dies. Determined to fulfill her final request, Jonathan prepares to re-visit Beyond Coast.\n\n<i>Policenauts</i> is a Japanese-style adventure with action elements, similar in many ways to Snatcher. The player interacts with the environment in a point-and-click fashion: positioning a cursor over an object allows the player character to examine it or perform other context-dependent actions. There are a few puzzles in the game, but most of the time the story is advanced by visiting various locations, examining objects, and talking to characters. Conversations usually include a selection of topics. \n\nAction sequences are similar to those of <i>Snatcher</i>, but are more numerous and varied. The player must rapidly shoot enemies moving within a one-screen area viewed from a first-person perspective, reloading the gun manually and trying to eliminate the enemy before Jonathan's health bar is depleted.

Rather than return to her life as a New York attorney, Kate chooses to journey with Hans Voralberg to the frozen northlands of Syberia aboard his futuristic train.\n\nKate, Hans and Oscar, the humorous automaton, will travel through four locations on their way to the mythical Syberia, where Hans believes the ancient mammoth race still exists. As the three make their way through the harsh, but beautiful, wintery landscapes, many obstacles will get in their way. The player has to talk to people Kate meets and solve situation-, inventory-based and mechanical puzzles. The single-cursor interface and the visual style (3D character models and pre-rendered backgrounds) are very similar to the original game.",

Christopher suggests that he think of something else...something happy to forget about his hunger.  Pooh decide to recall his friends' birthdays - which are the happiest of times.\n\nIn <i>Winnie the Pooh's Rumbly Tumbly Adventure</i>, join Pooh and his friends in Hundred Acre Woods on three different types of games:\n\n<b>Birthday Scrapbook Adventure Mode</b>: Pooh flips through his birthday scrapbook and re-live 5 different birthday adventures. Each adventure consists of tasks and problems Pooh has to help solve in order to ensure his friends have the best birthday ever. \n\nPooh can interact with many different elements around him.  For example, if there's a box blocking his way, have Pooh push it away.  Gopher is always near by to pop up and give Pooh tips on what he has to to do and how to do it.  Pooh will also have to talk to other characters to complete his tasks.  For example, in Piglet's Birthday, you will have to find Kenga and borrow her broom for Piglet.  Some tasks will require the help of Pooh's friends.  For instance, you will have to help Roo collect butterflies for Piglet's birthday by climbing on Eeyore's back and running after the butterflies.\n\nEvery now and then Pooh will be confronted by Heffalumps and Woozles.  Avoid being touched by them because that will cause you to have to start that segment all over. The only way to get rid of them is by popping a balloon...but don't worry, there is always one near by.\n\n<b>Junior Mode</b>: a place for younger players to interactive with Pooh and his friends in Hundred Acre Woods. See what happens when Pooh approaches a hive or play as Tigger as he spins around.\n\n<b>Multiplayer Mini-Game</b>:Play as Pooh, Roo, Tigger or Piglet in 6 mini-games on your own or with a friend!:\n\n<i>Cookie Maze</i> -  Grab as many cookies as possible while avoiding the Heffalumps and Woozles.\n\n<i>Catching the Honey Pot</i> - Try to catch as many honey pots as possible before time runs out.\n\n<i>Find the Cookies</i> - Look around and find the hidden cookies.  You will have to find a required number of cookies before time runs out!\n\n<i>The Scare-Off</i> - Play as Pooh or Piglet and try to make a scary face that will scare the other by pressing the correct button shown on the screen.\n\n<i>Follow the Line</i> - Trace the line around a path without getting out of the line as quickly as possible before time runs out.",

Do it right and you can use your power effectively, do it wrong and you'll give Athena a psychic backlash and drain her health. \"Action\" sequences play the same but involve tighter time limits and a turn-based system in which you must avoid enemy attacks in order to successfully use your powers.",

      "description": "A young man and his father are the newest residents of Long Life Town, a strange little town with even stranger characters. It is here that he meets the girl of his dreams - literally. But she wants nothing to do with him. The young man's mission is to improve his reputation among the many inhabitants of the town until they allow him to kiss them, and impress the girl of his dreams with his acts of kindness. \n\n<i>Chulip</i> is primarily a puzzle-solving adventure with a few role-playing elements. The player can freely explore the town, trying to figure out what to do next and how to do it. Kissing people is not as easy as it may seem; actions required to allow a person to be kissed range from waiting for the right moment to more difficult and branching puzzles like helping someone find a job. The more people the hero ends up kissing, the higher his heart meter goes, which allows the player to progress through the story and attempt more challenging tasks. \n\nApproaching angry townspeople, doing something they don't like, or injuring himself through various means will take away the protagonist's hearts. When all his hearts are gone, the player must restart or restore a saved game. Hearts can also be regained by sleeping, eating, and certain other tasks. Money is earned by kissing Underground residents (who only show up at certain times of the day), or by selling items found in the garbage. It can be used to buy various items that may help the player get further into the game, or train tickets to travel to new areas.\n\nCreated by a team that has split off from Love-de-Lic, the game shares many stylistic and gameplay-related traits with Moon: Remix RPG Adventure (the overall goal of making people happy, exotic characters, \"gibberish\" language with subtitles, day and night cycle, character schedules, etc.).",

Now the trail of this Dr. Chaos gets warm again as he resurfaces bent on continuing his criminal ways. As a sole agent of Interpol you must travel the globe and search for clues and finally bring this madman to justice.\n\n<i>Interpol: The Trail of Dr. Chaos</i> is for the most part a typical hidden object game. As is typical of this genre you must identify the listed objects in a photo-illustration. Few variations on the hidden object game-play conventions being level-end-puzzles where you must complete such tasks as identify differences between two photographs or simply finding the mistakes in one single photo to complete the level. If however you get stuck with a specific item and can't move to the next city there's a handy hint feature that will highlight any item you want from the list. The one other large thing that makes this game different is the almost completely immersive interface. From your icons to the world maps to the menu screens, the entire game is production designed to convey a sense of using Interpol computers and equipment to solve the puzzles.\n\nEach level is typically split into three stages and each level is themed after a world famous city. For example if your search takes you to New York, you can expect to scour The Statue of Liberty, Radio City Music Hall or The Brooklyn Bridge for clues.  Other cities you can expect to explore include Paris, Moscow, Tokyo, Hollywood, London and more. If however you get stuck with a specific item and can't move to the next city there's a handy hint feature that will highlight any item you want from the list.",

His cloudy memories and an attack on his life put him at odds with his fellow castaways.  Soon he finds himself caught in a struggle between the survivors and the island's original inhabitants.  If only he could remember the past.\n\n<i>Lost: Via Domus</i> ties in to the hit television series. The third-person action/adventure game presents an original story and introduces a new character into the Lost universe. Interacting with Lost characters, exploring Lost landmarks, and uncovering the island's secrets are all key to Elliott's survival.\n\nGameplay includes Resident Evil-like fetch quests and puzzle solving. As in the TV series, the game has flashbacks which are part of the game storyline. The story follows the first two seasons of the TV series. You explore the locations seen in the show - caves, beach, the area belonging to \"The Others\" and swan station. You can also interact with other characters of the tv-series. Trading and taking pictures with a camera is also part of the gameplay.",

The game plays as a classic point-n-click adventure, with the few added feature like the ability of taking shots of Strong Bad in various costumes he may find, collecting inessential items for receiving a higher rank and an obligatory arcade mini-game by a fictional game development studio Videlectrix.",

The main objective is to find all the objects listed at the bottom of the screen, on locations cluttered with scattered and assorted paraphernalia, within a time limit. Wrong clicks take away six seconds from the clock. The timer can be turned off at the main menu.\n\nOne of three mini-games appears after each level: a concentration game with cards, a Simon game with orbs and a Master Mind lock-picking game. Some of these games can be played over again to get extra hints. The hint button highlights the position of one of the objects.",

After Trogdor burninates all the inhabitants of Strong Badia, Strong Bad is out for revenge! Hacking into the Videlectrix mainframe, Strong Bad must go though the worlds of Videlectrix games such as \"Spirit of '76\", \"Peasantry\", and \"Stinkoman 20x6\".\n\nThe interface and game play follow the traditional point-and-click adventure for 3D engines where the player controls Strong Bad though the use of the mouse or Wii Remote pointer. The game does not offer mini-games as a non-critical path the previous episodes offered; Rather they are apart of the regular game path and replayable after completion of the game.\n\nThis game is the fifth and season finale of an episodic series featuring the characters of HomestarRunner.com.",

You will be receiving a plethora or orders via e-mail on your laptop, which will require you to take a photo of a certain animals. You can sneak up to take the best possible photo of a given situation, as your presence may scare or irritate certain animals. To speed up your trip, you'll have a jeep that comes with a native guide allowing you to use your camera as you move.\n\nBeing simulation and adventure in one, aside from having a goal to follow, the setting and authentic African continent provide you with more than just eye-candy.

      "description": "<i>The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition</i> is an enhanced remake of the classic adventure game The Secret of Monkey Island (1990) about the adventures of Guybrush Threepwood to become a pirate.\n\nThe gameplay is completely identical, but has been re-mastered. It includes an updated hand-drawn art style for high resolutions with more fluent animations, an orchestral music score, full voice-overs and an in-game hint system with clues to help players who get stuck. At any time while playing, players are able to switch between the original game and the enhanced version in real-time.\n\nThere are various ways to control the game. Unlike the original game, the possible verbs for actions and the inventory are not shown constantly on the screen. In the Windows version, the mouse is used to walk around and perform the default action for objects, the cursor can be changed by using the scrolling wheel, players can press a key to bring up a box with all possible verbs (as well as the inventory) and finally certain actions are also specifically bound to the keyboard keys. Next to the regular save system, there is also an autosave function.",

      "description": "<i>The Siege of Spinner Cay</i> is the second episode in <i>Tales of Monkey Island</i>, a series of point-and-click adventure games based on the <i>Monkey Island</i> franchise that was started by Lucasfilm Games with The Secret of Monkey Island (1990) and ran until the fourth game Escape from Monkey Island (2000). After nine years, the intellectual property was licensed by adventure developer Telltale, Inc. where many of the original LucasArts adventure developers had since moved.\n\nThe game starts off where chapter one ended. After leaving Flotsam Island, Guybrush sets sail to find LeChuck and Elaine. Shortly after his departure, he is attacked by a bounty hunter, and engages in a swordfight which leaves the mast of his ship damaged. On the advise of Van Winslow, Guybrush decides to travel to the Jerkbait Islands, to have it repaired. There, he finds Elaine, who is in the middle of a discussion between the Merfolk natives' leader and Pox-infected pirates about three ancient artifacts needed to find La Esponja Grande. Since Guybrush wants to cure the Caribbean from this voodoo pox, he'll need to find these artifacts before the pirates. Meanwhile, DeSinge is still to be considered an enemy, while a reformed LeChuck will offer his help.\n\nUnlike <i>Escape from Monkey Island</i> the game is rendered entirely in 3D, and the typical Telltale engine is used. Guybrush can be controlled through the keyboard keys or through mouse movement (selecting the character and dragging the cursor to the desired destination). Only a single mouse cursor is used for all actions and important items are stored in an inventory where they can be examined. Entirely new for a Telltale game is the incorporation of the classic adventure mechanic where items can be combined in the inventory to form new objects or to interact with each other.\n\nThe game makes many non-essential references to the earlier games and contains the classic <i>Monkey Island</i> ingredients such as humorous conversations and events, based on slapstick, play on words, witty retorts and contemporary cultural references, conversation trees, an unconventional approach to puzzle solutions, and the anti-heroic main character. The game's puzzles include triggers based on conversations, and item combination puzzles. It is not possible to die in the game and player can set the ratio of hints Guybrush casually mentions while progressing through the game. Full solutions are however never provided.\n\nUnlike other Telltale episodic adventure series, individual episodes initially could not be purchased separately. Because of the larger story arc or possibly financial reasons, users were required to buy the five episodes as a whole as they are released on a monthly basis. Later, the decision was reversed and episodes were also offered individually.",

In the course of the episode Guybrush meets Coronado De Cava and continues the search after La Esponja Grande.\n\nIn comparison to the former episodes a lot more puzzles are dialogue based. The other puzzles still consist of Guybrush walking through (new) places, taking everything he can and using the items on other items. In his inventory he can combine items too. This time there is no treasure hunting involved, although there is a new mechanic where Guybrush has to learn and use pirate grimaces.\n\nUnlike traditional adventure games the movement of Guybrush is not controlled by point & click but by holding the left mouse button and dragging the mouse in the desired direction (or alternatively with the keyboard keys). Interactions with items or persons are carried out with a single mouse button.\n\nUnlike other Telltale episodic adventure series, individual episodes initially could not be purchased separately.

      "description": "<i>Machinarium</i> is a point-and-click adventure set in a mechanical world where the player controls a small robot that has been kicked out of the city. He has to return and confront the Black Cap Brotherhood who terrorizes his kind and took away his girlfriend. The game consists of a number of static, non-scrolling screens the player gets to explore. This is done by clicking on objects in the environment to manipulate them, gathering them in an inventory and solving a wide array of puzzles, ranging from simple item combinations to more complex pattern analysis. The player's robot can scale his height to solve a number of problems, and communication is often presented graphically through speech bubbles that describe a scene using animated images, rather than words.\n\nIt is not possible to die, and when stuck, the player can opt to use a single hint (one per screen) or consult a walkthrough book. Pages in this book show the full solution to the level in the form of concept art panels, but to reach it a short side-scrolling shooter mini-game needs to be played. Therefore, the player cannot access it right away. In the beginning progress is done screen by screen, but after a while the world opens up more with many locations available at the same time.",

      "description": "<i>The Trial and Execution of Guybrush Threepwood</i> is the fourth release in the episodic <i>Tales of Monkey Island</i> series. It continues right after the cliffhanger of Episode 3: Guybrush is abducted by pirate hunter Morgan LeFlay who brings him back to Flotsam Island. There he gets accused of four crimes, e.g. paralyzing a cat. The first half of the game is spent with clearing Guybrush from this charges in front of the Flotsam court with Stan, known from the original games, as prosecutor.\n\nIn comparison to Episode 3, the dialogue based puzzles are reduced and most puzzles consist of Guybrush walking through (new) places, taking everything he can and using the items on other items. In his inventory he can combine items too. Besides a small treasure hunting episode with a twist there are no mini games involved.\n\nUnlike traditional adventure games the movement of Guybrush is not controlled by point & click but by holding the left mouse button and dragging the mouse in the desired direction (or alternatively with the keyboard keys). Interactions with items or persons are carried out with a single mouse button.\n\nUnlike other Telltale episodic adventure series, individual episodes initially could not be purchased separately. Because of the larger story arc or possibly financial reasons, users were required to buy the five episodes as a whole as they are released on a monthly basis. Later, the decision was reversed and episodes were also offered individually.",

      "description": "<i>Rise of the Pirate God</i> is the fifth and last episode in <i>Tales of\nMonkey Island</i>, a series of point-and-click adventure games based on the\n<i>Monkey Island</i> franchise that was started by <moby company=\"Lucasfilm\nGames\">Lucasfilm Games with The\nSecret of Monkey Island (1990) and ran until the fourth game Escape from Monkey Island (2000). After\nnine years, the intellectual property was licensed by adventure developer\nTelltale, Inc. where many of the original LucasArts adventure developers had\nsince moved.\n\nThe game starts off where the previous one ended.\nGuybrush has been killed by LeChuck, and finds himself crawling out of his grave\nin the afterlife. After crossing the river Styx, he arrives at the Crossroads,\nwhere the afterlife and the real world meet. He learns that everyone who arrives\nthere, brings something with them to which they cling. He himself has brought a\nShred of Life, with which he hopes to return to save Elaine and beat LeChuck.\n\nUnlike Escape from Monkey Island the game is rendered entirely in 3D, and the\ntypical Telltale engine is used. Guybrush can be controlled through the keyboard\nkeys or through mouse movement (selecting the character and dragging the cursor\nto the desired destination). Only a single mouse cursor is used for all actions\nand important items are stored in an inventory where they can be examined.\nEntirely new for a Telltale game is the incorporation of the classic adventure\nmechanic where items can be combined in the inventory to form new objects or to\ninteract with each other.\n\nThe game makes many non-essential references to the earlier games and contains\nthe classic Monkey Island ingredients such as humorous conversations and events,\nbased on slapstick, play on words, witty retorts and contemporary cultural\nreferences, conversation trees, an unconventional approach to puzzle solutions,\nand the anti-heroic main character. The game's puzzles include triggers based on\nconversations, and item combination puzzles. It is not possible to die in the\ngame and player can set the ratio of hints Guybrush casually mentions while\nprogressing through the game. Full solutions are however never provided.\n\nUnlike other Telltale episodic adventure series, individual episodes initially\ncould not be purchased separately. Because of the larger story arc or possibly\nfinancial reasons, users were required to buy the five episodes as a whole as\nthey are released on a monthly basis. Later, the decision was reversed and\nepisodes were also offered individually.",

The game has a heavy emphasis on user choices, with different decisions you make completely changing the way the story unfolds and which will lead to one of the many possible endings the game offers. There is no game-over screen if one of or all of the main characters die, there will just be a different ending given. \n\nSimilar to Quantic Dream's previous title Indigo Prophecy/Fahrenheit, the game is moved along primarily by the use of QTEs (Quick Time Events). Movement of your character is done by holding the R2 button and choosing a direction with the left analog stick. Holding the L2 button brings up your characters thoughts and pressing the button to go along with each thought will lead him/her to say or do something.\n\nBudget re-release of <i>Heavy Rain</i> includes game patch to support PlayStation Move controller (the patch can also be downloaded as standalone for free). That includes budget releases such as Platinum (in Europe), Greatest Hits (in America), or PlayStation 3 the Best (in Asia).",

      "description": "<i>Sam & Max 301: The Penal Zone</i> is the first episode of the third <i>Sam & Max</i> season named Sam & Max: The Devil's Playhouse. In the beginning of the game Max finds a toy which causes a vision of the future: Sam & Max defeat an evil space gorilla by banishing him to the so-called \"Penal Zone\". After the vision ends the gorilla's spaceship land on the street and he pretends to trade his advanced technology for an artifact - of course the one Max found. Only Sam & Max know his true intentions and they need to stop him...\n\nThe main new feature are Max's psychic powers which can be activated by clicking an icon on the upper right corner. Then the game switches to a first person where Max chooses and uses one of these powers. Besides the tutorial there are two available: teleport to a known phone (mostly used to save walking time) and predicting the future. When using the last power on a person or item a short clip gets played which shows the near future. This mostly results in a more or less obvious puzzle hint. During the episode Sam & Max also get access to a \"crime computer\": they need to feed it two related pieces of evidence to get a new location. \n\nThe rest of the gameplay is similar to the former seasons: the player walks through the levels, collects items and uses them to solve puzzles. Dialogues are a ring menu similar to Mass Effect where the player only chooses the topic instead of the whole sentence. Unlike traditional adventure games the movement of Sam is not controlled by point & click but by holding the left mouse button and dragging the mouse in the desired direction (or alternatively with the keyboard keys). Interactions with items or persons are carried out with a single mouse button.\n\nLike the Tales of Monkey Island series single episodes weren't available for purchase at the initial release. Users were required to buy the five episodes as a whole as they are released on a monthly basis.",

After the happenings in the first episode Sam & Max discover an old cinema projector with four movie reels. These show the adventures of Sameth and Maximus, Sam & Max's ancestors from the early 20th century. The player takes their roles.\n\nThe four reels have four scenarios: beating a challenge of uncovering the mysteries of the \"Sphunx\", raiding a tomb for the mysterious toy box known from the first episode, solving a theft on a train and the ending. The player can switch between the movies at any time. This is not only for convenience but also needed to solve some puzzles, e.g. they have to learn how to read hieroglyphs in the first reel before they can proceed in the third.\n\nOf course Max's psychic powers once again play an important part. This time there are three available: switching the reels, \nventriloquism and temporarily hiding into a can. The rest of the gameplay is similar to the former seasons: the player walks through the levels, collects items and uses them to solve puzzles.

      "description": "<i>Sam & Max 303: They Stole Max's Brain!</i> is the third episode of the third <i>Sam & Max</i> season named Sam & Max: The Devil's Playhouse. After the happenings of the second episode and a bathroom break Sam makes a horrible discovery: someone stole Max's brain! Of course he immediately searches for the culprits which turn out to be the main villains of the first two episodes...\n\nMax's psychic powers once again play an important part. Besides teleporting and predicting the future, which are known from the first episode, there also is a new one: Max can shapeshift into items which are shown in a picture, e.g. on a poster. \nThe rest of the gameplay is similar to the former seasons: the player walks through the levels, collects items and uses them to solve puzzles. Dialogues are a ring menu similar to Mass Effect where the player only chooses the topic instead of the whole sentence. Unlike traditional adventure games the movement of Sam is not controlled by point & click but by holding the left mouse button and dragging the mouse in the desired direction (or alternatively with the keyboard keys). Interactions with items or persons are carried out with a single mouse button.\n\nLike the Tales of Monkey Island series single episodes weren't available for purchase at the initial release. Users were required to buy the five episodes as a whole as they are released on a monthly basis.",

      "description": "<i>Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge - Special Edition</i> is a remake of Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge. After the events of The Secret of Monkey Island Guybrush came to fame but it is fading away. Now he is on the search for the famous treasure of Big Whoop. Unfortunately he is stuck on Scabb Island where Largo LaGrande, a former henchman of LeChuck, is in charge and steals all of Guybrush's riches... His first goal is to leave Scabb Island and later his search for Big Whoop gets more personal because an old enemy comes back to life...\n\nRegarding gameplay the game doesn't change much in comparison to its predecessor: the player explores the environment, solves item-based puzzles and talks to a lot of people through multiple choice dialogues. The biggest part of the game is the search for a treasure map during which the player has to solve interconnected puzzles on three islands.\n\nThe three main new features of this <i>Special Edition</i> are the all-new graphics, full voice acting (this time also available while playing with the original graphics) and new controls similar to the coin control of The Curse of Monkey Island: when right clicking on an object all valid verbs pop up. Optionally the player can circle through the verbs to change the default command for the left mouse button. Of course he can always switch to the original version where he has the original SCUMM-Interface available with nine verbs at the bottom of the screen. To start an action the player has to choose one of these verbs and then click on an item in the game world or the inventory.\n\nNew players who are not familiar with the original game can use two features to make their life easier: a hint system and the possibility to lighten up all interactive elements on the screen. On the other hand the \"easy\" mode from the original game is not included. The optional in-game commentary by Ron Gilbert, Tim Schafer and Dave Grossman can be activated during certain scenes of the game and gives background information about the development of the original game.

      "description": "<i>Sam & Max 304: Beyond the Alley of the Dolls</i> is the fourth episode of the third <i>Sam & Max</i> season named Sam & Max: The Devil's Playhouse. After the happenings of the third episode a horde of clones modelled after Sam swarm the city. During the course of the episode Sam & Max have to uncover and defeat the evil mastermind behind it...\n\nMax's psychic powers once again play an important part. Now he gets access to all powers from the previous episodes plus cards which allow Max to read a person's mind and a robot to fight creatures from the dark dimension. The rest of the gameplay is similar to the former seasons: the player walks through the levels, collects items and uses them to solve puzzles. Dialogues are a ring menu similar to Mass Effect where the player only chooses the topic instead of the whole sentence. Unlike traditional adventure games the movement of Sam is not controlled by point & click but by holding the left mouse button and dragging the mouse in the desired direction (or alternatively with the keyboard keys). Interactions with items or persons are carried out with a single mouse button.\n\nLike the Tales of Monkey Island series, single episodes weren't available for purchase at the initial release. Users were required to buy the five episodes as a whole as they are released on a monthly basis.",

      "description": "<i>CSI: Crime Scene Investigation - Fatal Conspiracy</i> is the sixth game based on the TV show <i>CSI: Crime Scene Investigation</i>. The player takes the role of a new member of the team and has to solve five murder cases at the side of Raymond Langston and other characters from the series. This time the cases are not completely unrelated but feature a story ark about a dangerous female drug lord.\n\nThe gameplay is exactly the same as in the predecessor CSI: Crime Scene Investigation - Deadly Intent: the player processes the crime scenes in a first-person view and collects evidence. If his cursor is over an interesting spot he can zoom in and use his tools. For every piece of evidence he has four options available: collecting, searching for prints, spraying or molding. The collected evidence can be accessed through the PDA to find additional trace evidence on it. Further processing happens in the crime lab where multiple computers are available which are used to search the databases, to compare the evidence under the microscope, assembling broken items or other similar actions. Most of these are carried out through a mini game, e.g. for comparing DNA the player has to match single strings to both samples.\n\nOther important places are the morgue where Robbins carries out the autopsies and Brass' office where the player asks for warrants or invites suspects for interrogation. To convince Brass or disprove a suspect's statement the player sometimes has to present the correct evidence. The PDA is used to quickly access locations, evidence or the case file with important information about the case. If the player gets stuck for a while a colleague sends him an e-mail with a hint where to continue. ",

      "description": "In <i>Utawarerumono</i>, the player takes the role of Hakuoro, a mysterious masked man who awakens one day in a strange village without having any recollections of his past. Soon he discovers that the country inhabitants are being oppressed by their emperor. Hakuoro organizes a rebellion, and eventually becomes the emperor himself. Determined to bring peace to the world, Hakuoro must nevertheless fight against countries who oppose his benevolent rule, and discover the truth about his own past in the process.\n\n<i>Utawarerumono</i> is a turn-based tactical RPG with elements of a visual novel. Much of the narrative develops through text and still images, with the player being able to make a choice from time to time. Battles occur as dictated by the narrative. The player navigates the characters on the battle field, attacking enemies when they are in range. Experience points are gained after the victory, and are distributed to raise the parameters of the characters.\n\nThe original PC version has explicit sexual scenes, which have been removed for the PS2 release.",

It turns out that his grandfather Arthur McFly is in grave danger and should be rescued from dirty hands of Kid Tannen. After saving the unlucky accountant, Doc and Marty return to their present, only to find that the world has changed once again: Tannen's gang wasn't destroyed in the thirties and grew into the fifth largest crime organisation of California. There is nothing left for our young hero, but to go back into the past and prevent such an outcome.\n\nThe adventure game features third-person view with real-time 3D graphics and pre-defined fixed, pivoting or scrolling camera settings. While interaction is performed in classic point-and-click style, the player has to move Marty by direction keys or dragging the character with the mouse. Puzzles are predominantly inventory-based; certain tasks can also be solved by gathering information and selecting the correct dialogue choices.",

      "description": "<i>Citizen Brown</i> is the third out of five episodes of Back to the Future: The Game.\n\nAfter reinstating the timeline of Kid Tannen and Grandpa Artie in the previous episode in 1931, Marty McFly and Doc Brown return to 1986, the relative present of the story. But during the leap Doc disappears and the time-machine crashes out of control into a billboard. Once again Marty finds himself in an disturbingly altered present. This time he has to encounter patriarchal Citizen Brown, who has turned Hill Valley into some kind of enfenced compound to make it the most secure, clean and peaceful place. Because the time machine is wrecked, Citizen Brown seems to be the only one who could help Marty. But to get in contact with him Marty has to break quite some rules of the surveillance society.\n\nThe adventure game features third-person view with real-time 3D graphics and pre-defined fixed, pivoting or scrolling camera settings. While interaction is performed in classic point-and-click style, the player has to move Marty by direction keys or dragging the character with the mouse. Puzzles are predominantly inventory-based; certain tasks can also be solved by gathering information and selecting the correct dialogue choices. \n\n",

      "description": "<i>Blue Toad Murder Files: The Mysteries of Little Riddle</i> is a one to four player murder /mystery adventure written in six episodes. The story is not fully revealed in episode one and solving the murder is only the beginning. Throughout the game a narrator sets the scene, reveals the story, asks questions and makes disparaging comments should the player struggle with a puzzle.\n\nThough the game can be played by up to four players, only one player is active at any one time. The game starts with Player 1 and the story progresses through to the completion of the first puzzle. After this if more than one player is taking part Player 2 takes over through to the end of the next puzzle and so on. The puzzles are simple and varied, they include brief quizzes about the game so far, deductive puzzles where the player must use clues to determine the correct answer from a set of five offered solutions, mental arithmetic, and tile based puzzles. <br>All of the puzzles are timed. Completing them within the 'Gold Standard' time without any errors earns the player a gold medal, making a mistake or being too slow results in either a silver medal which the narrator describes as 'The award of mediocrity', or a bronze medal, 'Yes you really were that bad'.\n\nIf a mistake is made the player is given the option to replay a puzzle or to skip it completely. At the end of an episode the number of gold, silver and bronze medals are totalled and are used to award trophies and to compare the performance of the players.\n\nThis game has no inventory. It is not a point and click adventure, nor is it a hidden object game, its style is more akin to an interactive storybook. There are points within the game where the player is presented with multiple locations to visit but the sections are self contained  and can be played in any order without affecting the story arc because they are not inter-dependant. At the end of any scene the player has the option to replay it or to continue to the next.\n\nThe PC version of the game is entirely mouse controlled.<br>\nThe game automatically saves the players' progress at key points in the game. There are no save game slots to choose from when resuming the game, the game automatically restarts from where the last gaming session ended.\n\nThe game has been released in many different packages though all releases have been by electronic download. Apart from being released as a full six episode game each episode has been released individually, episodes 1 & 2, 3 & 4,and 5 & 6 have been released as pairs, episodes 1,2,& 3 and 4, 5 & 6 have also been released as two separate groups of episodes. There have also been Special Editions of the game one of which was released for Christmas 2010 and which featured additional artwork in the form of an Advent calendar.\n\nThe episodes that comprise this game are ;<ul>\n<li>Blue Toad Murder Files: Mysteries of Little Riddle - Episode 1: Little Riddle's Deadly Dilemma </li>\n<li>Blue Toad Murder Files: Mysteries of Little Riddle - Episode 2: The Mystery of Riddle Manor </li>\n<li>Blue Toad Murder Files: Mysteries of Little Riddle - Episode 3: The Mystery of the Concealing Flame </li>\n<li>Blue Toad Murder Files: Mysteries of Little Riddle - Episode 4: Death From Above </li>\n<li>Blue Toad Murder Files: Mysteries of Little Riddle - Episode 5: The Riddles of the Past </li>\n<li>Blue Toad Murder Files: Mysteries of Little Riddle - Episode 6: Flight of the Felonious Fugitive </li></ul>\nSpecial Editions of the game are <ul>\n<li>Blue Toad Murder Files: Mysteries of Little Riddle - Christmas 2010 Edition </li></ul>",

      "description": "<i>L.A. Noire</i> is a hard-boiled detective game set in Los Angeles of 1947. Drawing strongly from the stylistic <i>film noir</i>, players control LAPD officer Cole Phelps through 21 cases as he works his way through the ranks of his department to solve a series of murder mysteries. Each case forms an independent section in the game, but there is an overarching story with recurring characters and Phelps's personal history while serving during the Second  World War. He starts off as a patrolman, but eventually advances to a traffic detective, homicide, vice, and finally arson investigator. With each promotion, a new partner and new locations become available.\n\nDuring a case the game blends slower investigative elements with fast sequences that involve on-foot and car chases, and gun-play. There is a strong focus on the story and character development, often with long cinematic sequences. Even though the game offers a large amount of freedom with exploration by car and on foot, it cannot be compared to Grand Theft Auto due to a number of restrictions. Playing as a detective, random civilians cannot be attacked and gun-play is reserved for specific sequences. In addition, each case is confined to a limited number of venues. The player is free to choose the order of investigation, but ultimately the game cannot be furthered until a satisfying conclusion for the case has been reached. Next to the main story Phelps can accept optional side-investigations through dispatch calls.\n\nWhen arriving on the scene of a murder case, it needs to be hunted for clues that can be researched. The game offers hints through rumble and audio chime when Phelps walks by, but these can also be disabled. Armed with evidence, the next step is usually interrogating witnesses and suspects. Faces of characters have been animated through the motion capture MotionScan technology and the detailed realism of these captures is used as an element of gameplay. When talking to characters, not only the evidence is important, but also their tone of voice, and especially facial expressions. Characters will sometimes look away, or have tics and expressions that can reveal information. During an interrogation the player needs to interpret these and then decide how to proceed through one of three options: Truth, Doubt, or Lie. Based on the decision, different paths and reactions open up. Failed action sequences can be replayed, but when the player constantly interprets the situation incorrectly and the investigation grinds to a halt, the entire case needs to be replayed. Plenty of chances are offered to correct mistakes and try a new approach, also often after the investigation of clues.\n\nEach case takes about an hour to complete. Depending on the speed and correct intuition applied to solve cases, the player earns ranks that provide intuition points. These can be used to eliminate options during conversations when stuck.",

One day he discovers that he has a half-sister, his father's illegitimate daughter. Tomoyo Sakagami, Tomoya's friend and one of the main characters in <i>Clannad</i>, offers to take care of the girl.

Numerous individuals and groups will try to stop the player, hoping to exploit the Talisman for their own ends, and the world of Orb (also the setting for the authors' Way of the Tiger series) is just generally a dangerous place, so -- hero beware!\n\nThat was the state of affairs back in 1984, when it was first published as number 11 in the line of original Fighting Fantasy gamebooks; 27 years later, it makes its way to its first computerized adaptation as a PSN mini for PS3 and PSP.  The gamebook's complete 400-section text has been retained with selectable hyperlinks (and lots of reading!), along with its original interior illustrations, but there is interesting new material as part of the presentation: character generation is enacted through (shades of Ultima) a tarot card reading of sorts; additionally, players can choose to resolve combat and test against their stats (the FF gold standard <small>SKILL, STAMINA</small> and <small>LUCK</small>) through the total randomness of simulated die-rolls or by participating in a more involved tile-matching memory minigame.  Of course, inventory and stat adjustment are fully automated.",

      "description": "Once again, the pioneering 1982 Fighting Fantasy gamebook #1, <i>The Warlock of Firetop Mountain</i>, finds itself adapted for electronic play -- for the third time in three years, making for its fifth licensed adaptation!  Gameplay is a very faithful adaptation of the gamebook's Choose-Your-Own-Adventure decision-making, souped up with some of Laughing Jackal's innovations (tarot-reading character generation, skill-testing minigames in place of randomized die-rolls) from their earlier adaptation of the gamebook Talisman of Death.  Game text is presented as scrolling words on a page, complete with the book's original illustrations.\n\nThe game's plot concerns itself with the player, an adventurer, putting to rest the concerns of a small medieval village about the nearby mountain fortress administered by the sinister magician Zagor.  Through the player's canny decisions, successful stat-challenges (using the standard Fighting Fantasy metrics of <small>SKILL, STAMINA</small>, and <small>LUCK</small>) and some genuine blind luck, the player will navigate the catacombs, mazes and hallways of the mountaintop fort, and end up in a showdown with the titular warlock.",

      "description": "<i>Jurassic Park: The Game</i> is an adventure game based on the <i>Jurassic Park</i> franchise that started with a first movie in 1993. The game takes place both concurrently and after the events of the first movie, but has none of the original characters or cast. It is set on Isla Nublar, the original island where the Jurassic Park with living dinosaurs is established. The story starts with different scenes that introduce the characters in a mixed-up chronology. It has Gerry Harding, the chief veterinarian of the park who shows his daughter Jess around. There is also Miles Chadwick and the professional smuggler Nima Cruz, two contacts sent by Dennis Nedry (from the original movie) who has a plan to shut down the park and run off with dinosaur embryos. But when the park's security systems go down and the dinosaurs roam freely, their plans are foiled.\n\nThe game is largely presented as an interactive movie. It consists of different animated scenes with visual clues where the player can interact, similar to the controls in Heavy Rain. These are used to manipulate items, examine objects in the environments, choose topics for conversations, but also include many quick time events where the player has to react quickly or perform quick actions such as centering a dot to steady someone's mind or adjusting the frequency of a radio. If a sequence is successfully performed, the story continues until another opportunity to interact arises. There is no complete freedom of movement, instead it consists of a series of linked scenes similar to the flow in a rail shooter game. There are however opportunities where players can observe the environment in any direction (to find the location of new clues or hotspots) and often there is a choice between different locations to go to. Unlike earlier Telltale games players can die if a sequence is not performed successfully. The game then automatically restarts at an earlier checkpoint to retry. This can be done an unlimited amount of times. As expected there are many encounters with dinosaurs, in fighting or escape sequences.\n\nThe game consists of four episodes that are played one after another. Each episode focuses on different characters and often alternates between them until their paths converge. In the first episode for instance it follows Gerry, Jess and Nima as they find their way around the island, while the second one introduces a paramilitary rescue team. For these four platforms the episodes are bundled together, but on the iPad they are released separately.",

      "description": "<i>Catherine</i> follows the story of Vincent Brooks, who is caught between his girlfriend Katherine McBride, who may be pregnant, and Catherine, a 22 year-old blonde he met at the Stray Sheep, a bar he hangs out at. Since his encounter with Catherine, Vincent has been having nightmares every night. The nightmares are puzzle-platforming sections shaped as tower-like levels in which Vincent must climb to the top by pulling and pushing blocks. While he climbs, the level falls apart, and sheep characters try to shove him back down. Along the way, the player can learn various climbing strategies to adapt to different situations. In some levels, a giant boss tries killing Vincent with a multitude of attacks.\n\nAfter (or rather before) the nightmares, Vincent hangs out at the Stray Sheep. In this bar, he can send and receive text messages, drink, talk to people or play an arcade game called Rapunzel (a series of 8-bit-like short climbing levels) until he goes back to sleep. When Vincent has to make choices, a blue and red gauge appears. This gauge indicates whether Vincent is more inclined towards law or chaos, which will influence the game's ending. Apart from the story mode, there is Babel, a special challenge in which one or two players have to climb as high as they can to achieve new records. Babel must first be unlocked by meeting certain conditions in story mode.",

      "description": "<i>A New Day</i> is the first episode of the first season of a five-part series based on the AMC TV series and the original <i>The Walking Dead</i> comic book series. The game is set in the United States at the start of a zombie outbreak. It takes place in the original universe but does not rely on characters or locations from the comic book or the TV series. Instead it tells a parallel story through a new character Lee Everett, but some original comic characters such as Glenn and Hershel make a cameo appearance throughout the series. Everett was a professor at the University of Georgia who was convicted for murder when he came home one day and found his wife cheating. In a fit of rage he murdered the man and was convicted. At the start of the game Everett is transported to prison, but the car crashes and that way he manages to escape. His main concern is then to flee from the zombies and he plans to travel to Macon where his parents and brother live. He soon meets a small girl called Clementine whose house has been overrun by zombies and he takes her along. Afterwards he meets many more characters and travels to different locations. The episode ends at the point where the team decides to stay at a Motor Inn as their home and build up a defence.\n\nIt is played as an adventure game with action and role-playing elements. During many sequences the character can freely look around the environment and interact with items. Compared to Telltale's previous title Jurassic Park: The Game there is slightly more freedom in exploration and more traditional adventure game elements such as examining objects, storing them in an inventory, and applying them in the environment. Many of the action sequences are shown as a cinematic or through quick-time events for the player to act quickly. When they are not performed in time, the character dies, and often Everett also has the option to save characters or to let them die in the hands of the zombies. While exploring different icons show actions such as examining, interacting or using an item. Inventory items also appear here and the player does need to interact with the inventory or combine items before they can be used.\n\nDuring conversations there are multiple options that can alter the outcome of events. A timer runs down during a conversation option and if none is chosen there is one selected by default. At the start of the game two display styles can be chosen. Standard shows more of the UI and helps with important choices, while Minimal turns of UI hints, help, and choice notifications. The setting can still be altered mid-game. Crucial choices during events and conversations are remembered and carried over to next scenes and episodes.\n\nThis episode is not available separately for the PC versions. For the Android, iOS, Xbox 360 and PS3 versions it is the base episode required to play the other four that can be purchased separately. For the PS3 and Android version a season pass is also offered as an additional option to receive the entire game in the same vein as the PC versions.",

      "description": "<i>The Walking Dead</i> is the first season of a five-part adventure game series based on the AMC TV series and the original <i>The Walking Dead</i> comic book series. Unlike the Xbox 360, PS3 and iOS versions, on the PC the episodes were not released separately but only as a single season pack. Players who bought the pack received the first episode when it was released in April and then the next four as they became available up to the release final episode in November of the same year. Once all are installed, any episode can be played right away, but as certain choices are carried over, it is recommended to play them in a chronological order. For the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions each episode was released as a separate expansion but the first episode needs to be purchased to play any of the other four. The PS3 version also offers a season pass to purchase all episodes right away at a lower price and play them as they become available. For iOS the first episode needs to be bought and then the other four episodes are available as in-app purchases, either individually or as multipack for the four remaining ones at a lower price. In December 2012 the full season was released as a single retail game for the Xbox 360 and the PS3, in the same format as the PC version. The Windows retail version was released in May 2013.\n\nEach episode consists of eight chapters. The five episodes are:<ul>\n<li>The Walking Dead: Episode 1 - A New Day</li>\n<li>The Walking Dead: Episode 2 - Starved for Help</li>\n<li>The Walking Dead: Episode 3 - Long Road Ahead</li>\n<li>The Walking Dead: Episode 4 - Around Every Corner</li>\n<li>The Walking Dead: Episode 5 - No Time Left</li></ul>The game is set in the United States at the start of a zombie outbreak. It takes place in the original universe but does not rely on characters or locations from the comic book or the TV series. Instead it tells a parallel story through a new character Lee Everett, but some original comic characters such as Glenn and Hershel make a cameo appearance throughout the series. The main protagonist Everett was a professor at the University of Georgia who was convicted for murder when he came home one day and found his wife cheating. In a fit of rage he murdered the man and was convicted. At the start of the game Everett is transported to prison, but the car crashes and that way he manages to escape. His main concern is then to flee from the zombies and he plans to travel to Macon where his parents and brother live. He soon meets a small girl called Clementine whose house has been overrun by zombies and he takes her along. Afterwards he meets many more characters and travels to different locations. Much of the game is spent on the emotional bond with Clementine and how Everett chooses to carry her through the hostile environment.\n\nIt is played as an adventure game with action and role-playing elements. During many sequences the character can freely look around the environment and interact with items. Compared to Telltale's previous title Jurassic Park: The Game there is slightly more freedom in exploration and more traditional adventure game elements such as examining objects, storing them in an inventory, and applying them in the environment. Many of the action sequences are shown as a cinematic or through quick-time events for the player to act quickly. When they are not performed in time, the character dies, and often Everett also has the option to save characters or to let them die in the hands of the zombies. There is a rewind function that provides the option to return to any of the eight chapters in an episode to choose a different option without having to replay the entire episode. There are sequences with a stealth mechanic where Lee can pick for a short amount of time and then needs to get back before he is discovered and gets killed. While exploring different icons show actions such as examining, interacting or using an item. Inventory items also appear here and the player does need to interact with the inventory or combine items before they can be used.\n\nDuring conversations there are multiple options that can alter the outcome of events. A timer runs down during a conversation option and if none is chosen there is one selected by default. At the start of the game two display styles can be chosen. Standard shows more of the UI and helps with important choices, while Minimal turns of UI hints, help, and choice notifications. The setting can still be altered mid-game. Crucial choices during events and conversations are remembered and carried over to next scenes and episodes. Each episode ends with a cliffhanger, a sneak preview of the next episode, credits, and an overview of the crucial choices and how they compare, shown as percentages, against the choices of all other players worldwide. A new episode starts with a flashback of the previous events, dynamically incorporating the player's choices. It is a much darker title than Telltale's previous games and as it includes cursing and gruesome killings, but the focus is on the moral choices and consequences in a violent environment.",

      "description": "<i>Captain Morgane and the Golden Turtle</i> is a prequel to the So Blonde games. Set in a much earlier era, the player follows the adventures of Morgane, daughter of pirate captain Alessandro Castillo. In the first chapter, that doubles as a tutorial, she is a young girl that wants to go out and play with her friends Nell and Bobbi, but her mother says she has to do some chores first. This involves finding some items and using them to clean up some dust and dirt around the house. When that is done, she is finally free to do as she pleases. Joining her friends she finds the local bully, Arno, pestering the two. She defeats him and climbs her favorite look-out rock, then sees her father's ship come in. Climbing through the bedroom window (the door is locked as her parents always have to do these silly private cuddle sessions when he gets home), she overhears him telling her mother that Uncle Eduardo fell overboard and is missing (presumed dead). Morgane is inconsolable. In the next chapter, players join Morgane again as she is made acting captain as a birthday present. After her mother died, her father had no other option than to take her aboard and let her travel with him. Now she's finally old enough to get given some more responsibility on the ship, much to the chagrin of the first mate, Diego. Her first task is to go ashore and find a new crew and a cargo for the ship she gets to pilot, the Winsome Maid.\n\nDuring the game, the player visits five islands, one of them the same island that Sonny will one day wash up on. It reuses some of the locations and characters from So Blonde: Back to the Island but it is not necessary to have played any of those games to understand the story. Travelling on the islands is instant through clicking on locations on an interactive map, between the islands by clicking on the ship in the docks. Progress is made by talking to people, solving puzzles and playing mini-games. The latter are entirely optional. The Nintendo DS version has no voice-overs but is otherwise identical to the other versions.",

While exploring and looking for evidence is done in 3rd-person perspective, all the forensics mini-games draw inspiration from the techniques used in the <i>CSI</i> games.\n\nThe story is told through four episodes that use same video effects and a type of humor seen in the TV series. What seems to have started as a simple bank robbery escalates into dangerous terrorist conspiracy and a nuclear threat.\n\nEach of the characters lets the player perform different actions. While controlling \"Very\" Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo or Ziva David, you'll be going through the crime scenes taking photos and collecting evidence. Abby does forensics from matching bullets to taking and comparing fingerprints and more. With Dr. Mallard you perform autopsy which consists of finding the points of interest and taking snapshots which trigger doc's response. Timothy McGee hacks into computers or uses spy satellite to track fleeing suspects. And Gibbs is there to interrogate the suspects when all the necessary evidence is collected. Gibbs often calls members of his team to the deduction board which requires the player to connects pieces of evidence into a larger picture.",

      "description": "<i>The Testament of Sherlock Holmes</i> is an entry in the long-running Frogwares adventure series about the fictional detective created by Arthur Conan Doyle. The game has no ties to any of the previous games and presents an original story not based on the writer's works. It is set in London, 1898, after Holmes just solved a case where precious jewels were stolen. Upon returning it however, the necklace turns out to be a fake and the detective himself becomes incriminated. On top of that, when he has an appointment with the Bishop of Knightsbridge and arrives there, the bishop is tied up and mutilated. While the player initially controls Sherlock Holmes, his strange behavior eventually will have the player control his fellow partner Watson, who needs to investigate himself whether Holmes is really implicated.\n\nThe game is played from a third-person perspective but it can be changed to a first-person view at any moment along with a fully rotatable camera. The game can also be switched to a classic point-and-click view where clicking a desired location causes the character to move there. The gameplay focuses entirely on the investigations. The environment is presented as an open world with an open investigations where different locations can be chosen and leads can be followed or ignored. Because of the larger scale, characters are now also able to run to travel faster. Items that can be interacted with in the environment are highlighted with a magnifying glass. These can be inspected from up close for further examination or other actions, such as moving an item. Often a close look is required to pick up specific clues. For some puzzles additional tools are provided to get more information out of the evidence. Some of these puzzles have questions that the player has to answer after the examination to gain clues. Rather than wrong or right answers, the player's deduction changes how the evidence can be used afterwards. There are also physical objects to collect that are kept in an inventory. Clues are stored on a deduction board where they can be combined to form leads. Much information needs to be gathered through conversations, where different approaches are available to catch suspects off-guard.\n\nOther elements of the menu contain general documents that provide context, a summary of dialogues, decorations and honors, a map of London, and the ability to switch characters when it is available. When stuck, a \"sixth sense\" system can be used to receive hints. It lights up all items that can be interacted with at once and based on the chosen difficulty level, it has a period of cooldown before it can be used again. For inexperienced players solving the puzzles can be simulated.",

They find themselves not only stuck together but transported to a strange new island and no way to get home. You must take the role of Aden and befriend the locals while exploring the oceans on your newly found Golem to find the truth and a way to restore Sonja back to her body. Besides exploration and fighting, the game allows you to perform various other activities such as farming, cooking, crafting and fishing.\n\n<i>Rune Factory: Tides of Destiny</i> is the second of its series to be released on the Wii and the first on the PS3 and it brings many new enhancements. One of the newest additions is your Golem, which you will use to explore the ocean surrounding Fenith Island. The combat has been updated from that of Frontier, adding new weapons such as Dual Blades and Katanas. You now have the ability to unlock up to 4 farms, one for each season. The Winter farm acts as a Mine where you can harvest ores and gems while the other three stay true to the series by having seasonal crops such as Cabbage in Spring, Corn in Summer, and Eggplants in Fall. Nearly the entire game is now voice acted as well. While you can play as a Male, in the end game there is an option to take over playing as the Female protagonist and marry one of 4 male choices.",

      "description": "<i>Proteus</i> is a meditative game based around exploration. \n\nIt is played from a first-person perspective and the environment is drawn in a minimalist style. The player starts in the water near an island that is largely randomly generated with each game session. There is no direct goal, instead the player can freely explore and choose a custom path. There are creatures that can be chased around or observed, sights to be discovered and more. Interaction is only provided through movement, but certain animals or elements can be interacted with by getting close. \n\nThe game has a day-and-night cycle and the weather also changes often. Through a certain mechanic, a cycle can be initiated to go through the seasons. This changes the entire environment and also introduces new events and animals. Sound and music also play an important role in the experience. The ambient sounds are altered by visiting certain locations, witnessing events or interacting with animals, changing the soundscape every time.",

Contrary to the first game's only area, the sequel has many different areas following different themes to explore. As the player gets closer to landforms or creatures, the silhouette becomes clearer and less blue or green, until it can be seen clearly. Instead of a reef where the encountered creatures are being shown, the game simply has a list of all the creatures. When a new animal is scanned with the submersible's sensor, a blue dot appears next to the scanned creature's name. Some of the animals can be interacted with. These initially have a pink dot appear next to their names instead of a blue one. When the possible interaction has been made, the dot turns blue.\n\nThe animals found in the game represent a great variety of undersea wildlife from all around the world. There is also many special locations, like ruins, to be found on the seafloor. These also figure on a list, named with poetic names rather than described. Some of these locations are found by surfacing the submersible.",

      "description": "The story focuses on the life of a young girl, Jodie, who has a special ability to see or feel things beyond this world. Beyond life. Game doesn't follow Jodie's life chronologically and jumps from point to point in her lifetime to give the player better picture of who she is and what she can do. Ever since she was a child, she shares a bond with an entity she calls Aiden. That entity isn't controlled by her, but two two of them cannot go separate ways. This ability, and this bond they share have made her feel like a lab rat all her life. Eventually, she was even recruited and trained by CIA because of her special gift. But what will happen when she decides she no longer wants to be anyone's puppet and decides to break off and go her own way... will she be let to do so, or will she be hunted down...\n\nMuch like <i>Heavy Rain</i>, player has multitude of choices during the game which may in minor or major way affect the overall story with several different endings. During gameplay, player can switch between Jodie and Aiden at any time. While controlling Jodie, player can explore the surrounding, interact with objects, talk to other characters or fight if in such situation. While controlling Aiden, player can float around up to a limited distance from Jodie, and sometimes move or trash certain objects. As the story progresses, Aiden will be able to possess or even kill certain characters.",

      "description": "<i>The Wolf Among Us</i> is a five-part adventure game series based on the <i>Fables</i> comic book series by Bill Willingham. The game is canon with the comic book universe and is set in the 1980s, thirty years before the first comic book. It describes an alternate version of our world where characters of our fairy tales and fables live in a separate world known as the Homelands ruled by a tyrant known as the Adversary. There are some who have fled the world, referred to as <i>Fables</i>, who has established a colony in the human world known as Fabletown, located in Manhattan in the USA. They have to hide their presence from the humans by taking on a human form through an enchantment known as <i>glamour</i>. When Fables refuse to take it or cannot afford it, they are sent to a rural community known as The Farm. In the game the player controls Bigby Wolf, the reformed Big Bad Wolf who has now become sherriff of Fabletown. His task is to make sure the residents follow the laws. The game is filled with references and characters from famous fables such as Snow White, Beauty, Beast, Mr. Toad, Bluebeard, The Little Mermaid and Woodsman, but often with a grim attitude while most of the game has a noir, hardboiled atmosphere.\n\nOn the PC the episodes were not released separately but only as a single season pack. The Xbox 360, PS3 and iOS versions offer the first episode as a separate purchase. The other four can then be bought separately (PS3/Xbox 360) or in a pack through a season pass (Xbox 360) or Multi-Pack (iOS). There is also a free trial version available with just the first act of the first episode for the Xbox 360 and PS3. For the PS3 all five episodes are also available as a single purchase through the season pass version. Both Xbox 360 and PS3 received a compilation release afterwards bundling all episodes. For the PS Vita, PS4 and Xbox One, this is the first release of the game on the platform.\n\nEach episode consists of six chapters. The five episodes are:<ul>\n<li>The Wolf Among Us: Episode 1 - Faith</li>\n<li>The Wolf Among Us: Episode 2 - Smoke and Mirrors</li>\n<li>The Wolf Among Us: Episode 3 - A Crooked Mile</li>\n<li>The Wolf Among Us: Episode 4 - In Sheep's Clothing</li>\n<li>The Wolf Among Us: Episode 5 - Cry Wolf</li></ul>The gameplay is largely identical to The Walking Dead. The game is story-driven and incorporates decisions by the player that are carried along for the entire game. There is a certain amount of freedom in exploration and sometimes multiple paths are offered, for instance in choosing where to go next. Many objects in the environment can be examined and some can also be picked up and are stored in a separate inventory. These objects are not always necessary to solve puzzles, but can improve relationships in conversations when the object is useful. Conversations with key characters and solving small puzzles are the most important trigger to progress through the game. Many of the action sequences are shown as a cinematic or through quick-time events for the player to act quickly. When they are not performed in time, the character dies or the game chooses a different route for the events. As in <i>The Walking Dead</i>, conversation options are almost always time limited and when the player does not react in time, a decision is made automatically. Each episode ends with a sneak peek at the events in the next one and a new episode starts with a short recap.",

      "description": "<i>Faith</i> is the first episode of the five-part The Wolf Among Us adventure game series based on the <i>Fables</i> comic book series by Bill Willingham. For the listed platforms it is available separately, unlike the PC version only available as an entire season purchase only. The game is canon with the comic book universe and is set in the 1980s, thirty years before the first comic book. It describes an alternate version of our world where characters of our fairy tales and fables live in a separate world known as the Homelands ruled by a tyrant known as the Adversary. There are some who have fled the world, referred to as <i>Fables</i>, who has established a colony in the human world known as Fabletown, located in Manhattan in the USA. They have to hide their presence from the humans by taking on a human form through an enchantment known as <i>glamour</i>. When Fables refuse to take it or cannot afford it, they are sent to a rural community known as The Farm. In the game the player controls Bigby Wolf, the reformed Big Bad Wolf who has now become sherriff of Fabletown. His task is to make sure the residents follow the laws. The game is filled with references and characters from famous fables such as Snow White, Beauty, Beast, Mr. Toad and Woodsman, but often with a grim attitude while most of the game has a noir, hardboiled atmosphere.\n\nThe gameplay is largely identical to The Walking Dead.

It starts when Sheriff Bigsby receives a call from Toad about a disturbance at his house. As he meets the Woodsman again, a girl is present Bigsby does not know. A sequence of events have him work together with Snow to find out the girl's identity and her involvement in the events. Different locations are visited and leads for the further episodes are provided.",

      "description": "In Mountain Crime: Requital you play Dr. Philip White that has been summoned to a recently opened lodge called the White Wolf Hotel.  A hotel guest has become ill and Mr. Grey phoned to have you drive up to the hotel at once.  The mood and style of the game continues down many twists and turns of a whodunit.  Many of the classic murder mystery themes are here such as rainy nights, abandoned hotels and washed out roads along with locals you interact with such as the quirky irritated police officer.\n\nThe game style is one of hidden object puzzle adventure with hidden object search elements scenes that help key plot event sequences or yield items to assist the player for solutions. The hidden object scenes are different than traditional with scenes presenting a circle with object silhouettes that need to be found from the scene instead of word objects.  Some scenes have multiple circle object silhouettes that may need to be finished before the area or room is complete.  Puzzles and obstacles are presented along the lines of locked objects such as doors, cabinets and machines with missing parts or items which must be solved to enable story advancement.\n",

      "description": "<i>The Raven: Legacy of a Master Thief</i> is an episodic criminal adventure game in the style of Agatha Christie novels. The overall story is about a thief called The Raven who did some of the most spectacular coups until he was killed by an inspector called Legrand. A few years later: one of the famous Eyes of the Sphinx jewels is stolen from the British Museum. Style and execution seem to match those of the old Raven and are feeding rumors that The Raven may not be as dead as expected.\n\nThe game consists of three chapters called <i>The Eye of the Sphinx</i>, <i>Ancestry Of Lies</i> and <i>A Murder Of Ravens</i>. Initially only the first chapter was made available, with the subsequent chapters released in a monthly interval and automatically downloaded on release.\n\nIn the first chapter you start on the Orient Express and take over the role of Jakob Anton Zellner, a cozy old Swiss police officer, who has been ordered to help out the now famous inspector Legrand. On your journey by train and by ship you meet a dozen individual characters and all of them seem to be on their way to Egypt where the remaining Eye of the Sphinx is supposed to be exhibited. In later chapters you will also play the story from the perspective of several of the game's other key protagonists, revealing more details of the story and introducing plot twists.\n\nThe game is a classical point-and-click adventure, though the scenes are fully rendered in 3D. In addition to the classic mouse controls a controller can be used to move the character through the scenes. The game has an orchestral soundtrack and several cut-scenes, lending a cinematic edge to the game.",

      "description": "Something strange happened to the protagonist Ray Doewood: an alien moved into his brain! The direct effect is that Ray is now able to read the thoughts of other people. Unfortunately The Man, a mysterious villain, also has interest in the alien and sends his lackeys to capture Ray. The goal of the game is to flee from that undesirable fate.\n\nEach level consists of a freely explorable scene in which Ray meets various humorously overdrawn people. The goal is to read their minds, find out what they desire and give it to them. Then Ray usually gets something out of it which another person desires and so on. The special gimmick is that the whole world and its inhabitants are made out of cutout paper: Ray can cut out (read: take) objects and stick it to other, predefined places in order to solve puzzles. There is also a bit of platforming involved, both in order to reach other places and to avoid The Man's men. Objects can (in some cases have to) be used in order to avoid enemies, e.g. by sticking \"sleep\" to a guard which desires rest.",

      "description": "Despite being called <i>The Walking Dead: Season Two</i>, this release is actually only the first episode (<i>All That Remains</i>) of a five-part series. \n\n<i>The Walking Dead: Season Two</i> continues the story of The Walking Dead and is based on the comic books (not the TV series) of the same name. Everyone becomes a zombie, called \"Walker\", after death (at least when the brain is still intact) and the series follows people in their attempts to survive. Just like the source material, the game is less about fighting zombies than showing how the survivors react to their situation and interact which each other. \n\nBesides a small intro portion, the story is set over a year after the happenings of the first game. Clementine initially travels together with Omid and Christa, but due to unfortunate circumstances she soon has to survive on her own and find new people to trust. The player takes the role of Clementine, but regarding gameplay - with the obvious difference that the girl is not nearly as strong as the previous protagonist Lee is more often on the defensive - the mechanics are largely unchanged compared to the predecessor. \n\nOne of the main pillars of the game is making choices: in each episode, there are many decisions to make which influence how the remainder of the game plays out; the consequences may range from small to big (e.g. the death or survival of other characters). Those decisions, including Clementine's answers in conversions, have to be made within a time limit. The game also reacts to some decisions made in the first game when a savegame is imported.\n\nSometimes Clementine has the opportunity to explore a small areal and interact with items or people in order to reach her next goal or just to learn more about the situation. Here the game uses a mix between direct movement of the character and using an cursor to choose an item to interact with: after hovering over an object, a list of possible actions (e.g. looking at, taking the item or using another item in Clementine's possession) pops up. However, in comparison to the predecessor the puzzle-solving aspect has been completely removed; proceeding is only a matter of interacting with all needed items and persons. The frequent action sequences play out in quick-time events (the player has to press respectively hammer the buttons which are displayed on the screen or click on the correct spot on the screen under time pressure); in other cases there are mini games of the same complexity to solve.\n\nThe other four episodes were released separately as DLC (downloadable content) or bundled as a Season Pass for this release:\n<ul><li>The Walking Dead: Season Two - Episode 2: A House Divided</li>\n<li>The Walking Dead: Season Two - Episode 3: In Harm's Way</li>\n<li>The Walking Dead: Season Two - Episode 4: Amid the Ruins</li>\n<li>The Walking Dead: Season Two - Episode 5: No Going Back</li></ul>",

      "description": "<i>Murdered: Soul Suspect</i> is a third-person adventure game with minor action and stealth elements. The game is set in Salem, Massachusetts (USA) and the protagonist is detective Ronan O'Connor, a former convict who bettered his life and joined the force. The game opens with his death. In pursuit of the Bell Killer, a serial killer who terrorizes the town, he is thrown out of a window and then dies after being shot. Instead of passing away, he turns into a ghost and meets his long dead wife Julia who tells him he is between worlds as there is something unresolved about his life. He needs to figure out who killed him and stop that person. He can move around freely in the open world environment of the town and is not hindered by physical borders, but cannot pass through obstacles that only exist in the spirit world. There are other rules, as he can only enter houses and buildings when a door or a window is open.\n\nDespite the freedom of movement the investigation needs to be done in a linear way. Starting with his own crime scene, O'Connor needs to collect different types of clues to move on to new locations and progress through the story. Each location has a number of clues to discover, but only the crucial ones need to be found. To advance, he then needs to answer questions about the scene in the form of a puzzle, built up through the clues. After guessing successfully, the game moves on, usually to a new environment. The player is allowed to make mistakes as it only leads to a lower ranking of the puzzle. Even though O'Connor can examine the environment, he is not able to interact with it directly. He has however access to a number of powers that allow him to influence people, eavesdrop on conversations, possess people directly and peek. Certain areas can only be reached by possessing a cat and sneaking inside. Possessing people does not offer direct control over them, but provides control over their senses and mind-reading. There are also side missions, not related to the story, where O'Connor needs to help out a fellow ghost move on to a next world by answering questions through gathering clues in the environment.\n\nCertain parts of the game are spent with Joy, a little teen medium he meets early on, who explains the world to him and often acts as a sarcastic sidekick. They need to work together as Joy can manipulate the environment to help him. In these stealth sections O'Connor often needs to distract people using his presence and poltergeist actions to clear the way. The other stealth actions segments are provided through encounters with demons. These roam various locations and O'Connor can execute them out by sneaking up from behind and performing a combination of keys and buttons. If they spot him however, he needs to quickly shift between ectoplasm hiding spots in the environment to stay out of their way. When performed successfully, they will stop the search and leave after a while. If O'Connor possesses a human he cannot be spotted by demons.\n\nStarting with the four initial powers, O'Connor learns new abilities throughout the game, such as teleportation across short distances, telekinesis to a limited degree, and the ability to pick up memory residue that introduces memories he can visit as if in a movie to find clues for the investigation. There are 242 optional collectibles to collect: nine sets of artifacts, and eight sets of artifacts for all the ghost stories.",

Families were separated, fathers and sons killed in battles by enemy or in trenches by diseases. The game, inspired by the letters written during the Great War follows the stories of several people whose tragic destinies become intertwined as the war drags on. \n\nThe game has four playable characters. One of the many Germans deported from France, Karl is separated from his wife Marie and son Victor and forced to join the German army, while Marie's father Emile is drafted into the French army. Freddie is an American volunteer who seems to have nothing to loose, and Anna is a Belgian student looking for her father. There's also Walt the dog that will aid the characters on multiple occasions. \n\nGameplay-wise it is essentially a mix of side-scrolling adventure with a lot of puzzles and a straightforward action game. During \"adventure\" segments the player guides one of the characters though a series of obstacles using their unique abilities. The puzzles include manipulation with objects, helping out people, sneaking past guards or enemies etc. Action sequences vary from dodging enemy bombs to driving a tank amidst a heated battle.",

One day, while reminiscing on the events from the past, you stumble upon a pair of abandoned marionettes, Marine and Maria. You take Marine under your care while your classmate Alessa takes the other one. While Alessa don't think of marionettes as anything more than a bunch of circuits pieced together, you experience tells you that's not true and you decide to prove her wrong by once again raising your marionette to a near-human form.\n\nThis visual novel comes with a typical interface for such adventure games, and also includes unlockable CG album, but aside from regular story dialogues your main focus in the game would be to construct and upgrade your marionette to act as close as humanly possible. You can teach her communication or you can focus on construction of her physique and functional processing. While you can change her appearance with different outfit or skin and hair color, that will not change her personality or the ability to reason or understand or act differently. For that you will need to acquire and install better CPU, mother board, cooler, generator and other such parts.",

      "description": "In <i>Aquanaut's Holiday: Kakusareta Kiroku</i>, the player boards a subway and explores the deep ocean around an fictional atoll. In contrast to the predecessors, the game tells a story about a research station and centers around their employees Jessica Porter and Robert Kemelmann; the player takes the role of a journalist in search of a missing researcher. The story is told through dialogue, mostly serves to unlock new and varied areas to explore and later takes a slightly futuristic turn.\n\nDespite the story, the main drive of the game is still to explore the ocean and its species as end in itself. In order to solve the story missions, the player needs to explore in order to find specific places (e.g. mysterious stones) and to find sonar buoys. Those have to activated with batteries in order to improve the submarine's range of operation and unlock new areas. The batteries have to be bought at the research base with money rewarded for discovering new creatures. Also available for purchase are special buoys which can be deployed as fast-travel points (the player can always jump to the research base).\n\nThe only typical game feature are special fish (three per area) which can be located by following their sound. After approaching them, the player has to solve a <i>Simon Says</i> mini game (which becomes harder after each fish) and is rewarded with red slime. This slime is used to upgrade the submarine's speed, agility, battery/buoy capacity or unlock the ability to make photos. Otherwise the submarine has no influence to its surroundings - it is invisible to sea creatures and it is impossible to crash against the environment. The game also has a in-game encyclopedia of all areas and creatures the player encounters.",

      "description": "More than simply based on the Disney Channel Original movie, the Phineas and Ferb: Across the 2nd Dimension video game could be considered an interactive part of the film. Those familiar with the movie will recall the \"Brand New Reality\" montage sequence where Phineas, Ferb, Candace, Agent P and Dr. Doofenshmirtz are jumping into one bizarre dimension after another while being pursued by evil Normbots.  The video game's storyline fills in some gaps as to what exactly took place during this frantic dimension-hopping.  The various dimensions our heroes pass through contain a number of references to certain episodes of the TV show that were not referenced in the movie.  Two players can co-op play at the same time, or a single player can work with a computer-controlled partner. \n\nThe game plays like a typical platformer with numerous puzzles, mini-games and boss battles in-between exploring and fighting basic enemies.  There are countless items to collect and special characters (each with their own unique ability) to unlock as well as costumes/skins that can be obtained for all of the playable characters.  Once more than the two main characters are unlocked, players can switch characters between levels if they so choose.  Weapons can be customized with different colors and sound effects once these are earned/unlocked.  Additionally, there are many achievements/trophies to be won and an increased difficulty mode becomes available after achieving the final trophy.  Background props change depending on what time of the year the game is played (e.g. jack-o-lanterns are visible around Halloween, snowmen and Christmas lights appear in December, etc).  \n\nThis game should not be confused with the DS game that has the same title, but is otherwise a completely different game with an alternate plot line, other types of weapons, dimension levels and boss battles unrelated to the Wii and PS3 versions.",

Thus started the new chapter in Touya's life he had no idea he was a part of.\n\nUnlike the bulk of visual novels that consist of reading with occasional choices that branch the story, this game features TOi (aka Technology of Interest) which automatically gathers articles for Touya where player can decide which articles to read and which to neglect. By reading articles, certain events will become available, which will change the course of the story.",

      "description": "In <i>Crimes & Punishments: Sherlock Holmes</i>, the player controls the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. The game is set in the late 19th century and, in contrast to the predecessors, tells not one big case but six smaller, independent ones. Three of them are original stories and two (<i>The Fate of Black Peter</i> and <i>The Abbey Grange Affair</i>) are based on <i>Sherlock Holmes</i> stories by Arthur Conan Doyle. <i>The Riddle on the Rails</i> takes the basic premise of Doyle's story <i>The Lost Train</i>, but the rest of the story is original. All cases involve Holmes investigating a murder.\n\nSolving crimes has four main components. The first part is investigating the environment: here the player controls Holmes either in first or third-person (the point & click interface of the predecessors is no longer available) and navigates him through the scenes, e.g. a garden or a mansion. When Holmes walks near something interesting, a notification pops up and after pressing a button, Holmes will make an observation or interact with the object. In some cases the game switches to first-person detail view of the object, e.g. a shelve, and the player moves a cursor in search for more hot-spots. When a smaller object is viewed in detail mode, it can be rotated. \"Finished\" hot-spots are marked and detail views are automatically exited when there is no more information to be found. Additionally there are two special viewing modes available which can be turned on when investigating the environment: instinct (allows Holmes to find small details) and imagination (Holmes recreates past events in his mind). Because those viewing modes are mandatory to find certain clues, there is a notification when they should be used.\n\nThe second component is interrogating suspects and witnesses. When entering conversation, Holmes has a number of topics to choose from. This results usually in an automatic dialogue between Holmes and the other persons, but in some cases Holmes can cut in when the person is lying. Then he is presented with a number of rebuttals and has to choose the correct one. Those are either previously collected clues or come from Holmes' deductions about the person: like in the novels, Holmes closely inspects the person's outside for conclusions about character and history. From a gameplay perspective, it is similar to the object detail view: moving a cursor over the person and clicking on hot-spots.\n\nThe third component are mini games which are frequently encountered while processing evidence or searching the environment, e.g. when opening a lock. The gameplay of those mini games have a wide range and can be puzzles, action-based or simply using things in the correct sequence. While most are short, some like creating a time-table of events can be a bit more involved. All mini games can be skipped. Additionally there are some inventory-based puzzles in which Holmes has to collect a few things to (automatically) use with another thing. \n\nThis all comes together in the fourth component: deductions. They are performed on a separate screen and lead to the resolution of the case. First there is a cluster of all clues Holmes has found so far and the player has to choose two which belong together and form a deduction, e.g. \"the victim was shot\" and \"the revolver has one bullet missing\" may lead to the deduction \"the victim was shot with the revolver\". Multiple deductions together lead to another deduction and eventually to the murderer or the next step to take in the investigation, e.g. a recreation of the crime. However, many clues can be interpreted differently and this is the player's job: choosing between two alternatives based on everything what was learned - different interpretations lead to different results. In the end, the player is free to choose the conclusion and the game does not prevent accusing the wrong suspect. However, after the case the player can optionally view if the choice was correct and jump back to the last decision. There is also always a moral choice to take which boils down to hitting the murderer with the full charge of the law or being lenient.\n\nAs the cases are independent, those choices don't have impact besides a letter or newspaper story which can be picked up during the next case. While most environments are exclusive to the case and are opened up one after another, there are two places which are visited in almost every case: Holmes' and Watson's home (used for research, processing evidence and changing Holmes' appearance) and Scotland Yard (used for interrogating arrested suspects and inspect their belongings, visit the morgue or converse with Inspector Lestrade). The player almost exclusively controls Holmes; other characters like Watson or the sniffer dog Toby are only controlled in a few sequences.",
