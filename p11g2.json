      "description": "<i>The Casebooks of Ace Harding</i> includes Game Boy ports of D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu: A Nightmare Comes True!! (previously released on Game Boy) and D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu II: Lost in Las Vegas. Deja Vu is a port of a 1987 game that had been made for various systems. It's a classic detective story, with you waking up to a dead body with total amnesia - you don't know who you are, or how you got there, and you don't know who the corpse is, either. D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu II had never been released for Game Boy before, and was put in the same cart, selling for the price of one game.",

      "description": "The first handheld <i>Sakura Taisen</i> game, released between the second and the third main ones, takes place in the original setting: the imperial capital in Japan of 1920s. It is the Taishou era, time of rapid technological development and acquaintance with Western lifestyle in Japan. Disguised as a group of actresses in the imperial theater, the Hanagumi Brigade consists of lovely ladies who are at the same time skilled fighters, able to pilot mechs, and to confront the forces of evil that threaten Japan. A new commander of Hanagumi arrives at the theater to work under the guidance of Ichiro Ogami, the main hero of the series. He leads the beautiful girls Sakura, Sumire, Honglan, and others into battle against demons.\n\nAs in most other games in the series, <i>Sakura Taisen GB</i> is a mixture of Japanese-style adventure with dating mechanics and tactical turn-based battles. The light RPG angle is also present, as the girls fight differently depending on how the protagonist treats them. Unlike other Sakura Taisen games, the battles here are entirely menu-driven. Also, the main plot is non-linear, and it is possible to reach fourteen different endings, which also include bad ones. The hero may even get thrown out of the theater for indecent behavior.",

Interact with the various aquatic life in the maps and watch them swim around in interesting patterns.\n\nThe Windows version of the game is entirely mouse controlled, the keyboard is only required when the player signs in for the first time. In addition to the same mini games the Windows version features a camera icon which takes snapshots of barbie as she explores. These pictures are held in the game's scrapbook and can be printed out. Barbie also has some handy tools, a magnifying glass and a torch, to help her explore the ocean. Barbie talks throughout this game and a soundcard and speakers are essential.",

Their investigation leads them to an old spooky house, Jekyll Mansion. Once inside, they search the rooms to gather clues to reveal the identity of the jewel thief. Gameplay consists of positioning characters close to objects in such a way that a menu at the bottom of the screen lights up. The player can then choose the correct action (examine, search, use, take) from the menu. There is also plenty of dialogue involved. To solve puzzles, the player switches between characters and uses each person's special abilities. ",

      "description": "<i>Love Hina Party</i> is one of several games based on a Love Hina manga, which in turn was made into anime. The basic story in Love Hina centers around a young boy, Keitaro Urashima, trying to fulfill his promise to a girl he shortly met as a child but whose name he has forgotten. Their promise was to study hard and get accepted at Tokyo University, where they could meet once again. While studying for exam, Keitaro is staying at his grandmother's hotel which seem to be inhabited by girls only. As a new manager of the hotel, he is having a plethora of ups and downs in his relationship with the girls, and one of them even turns out to be the very girl he made a promise to.\n\nThis game puts you in shoes of Keitaro himself as he resumes his duties of a hotel manager. During adventure mode, you can check certain predefined locations and speak with characters you meet, sometimes selecting your answer during conversation. Sometimes during the story, the girls in Hinata apartments will ask you quiz questions about the Love Hina anime. The action mode in the game is done via four different mini-games which, unlike the adventure mode, use 3rd-person perspective.",

      "description": "<i>Kigantou Hihou Densetsu</i> (Eng. \"The Legend of Treasure on a Strange Rock Island\") is a top-down adventure game from <i>Meitantei Conan</i> series featuring Edogawa Conan (real name is Kudou Shin'ichi) as a protagonist on a case to solve the mystery on the Kigantou island. However, Conan is not the only character you can control in the game, beside him you can control Shin'ichi's girlfriend Ran, her father, the renowned detective thanks to Conan, Kogoro, Ran's high-school girlfriend, Sonoko, and Conan's classmates Mitsuhiko, Ayumi and Genta. Based on the character you control, certain areas may be accessible or inaccessible, and certain dialogues and dispositions from other characters may vary.\n\nThe story starts with Togawa sisters, Satomi and Miki, receiving a golden statue. They lost their parents at an early age, never knowing what actually happened to them. One day, a letter came from a wealthy person living on an island somewhere in the western Japan Sea. Upon receiving this letter, they realized the golden statue belongs to the place from which the letter was sent. If this is a family heirloom, could the person who sent the letter be someone related to them? Can they know what happened to Satomi and Miki's parents? As Conan and the others opened the Togawa sisters' request, they decided to help uncover the mystery behind their lineage and golden statue and set off on a trip to the solitary island in question where ships travel to only twice a week. As they arrive on the island of strange shape, the notice the residents of an island village appear a bit weird, and there seem to be history behind the wealthy island family. And to top it all, the murder in front of the wealthy looking western-style estate occurred just in front on them and the murderer ran away from the scene of the crime. It's Conan's task to solve all the mysteries and catch the killer, for by his own words, the truth is always only one.",

During the holidays, Conan and Ran decide to meet at a certain cafe. While there, Ran runs into her classmate Miki by chance, who is part-time working at that very cafe. In turn, Miki calls them to come to her place where she tells them about her worrying about her sister Satomi. Apparently she said she's going on a trip as she was heading out, but she never called or told Miki where she went. She is a rather methodical person, which makes her behavior suspiciously strange, and Miki asks Ran and Conan to help her find her sister. Also, before she went out, she was acting strange according to Miki. After listening in more detail and agreeing to help Miki look for Satomi, Conan and Ran head to Satomi's room to look for clues about her whereabouts. There they find out what was a direction to a secluded old temple and with that as their only lead to go on, they set out to find Satomi.\n\nExploring locations is done in top-down perspective which also allows you to switch between characters, thus not controlling Conan alone. The map system shows you your current location. Message system is used for dialogues with other characters which uses typical first person view displaying the talking character and the text below the character image. On your investigation while searching for clues and talking to other characters, you will obtain keywords which lets you think the case through and after collecting the necessary keywords, you can start the reasoning process. Conan also keeps track on characters he meets, and you can access character profiles from the in-game menu, the same way you access keywords or map system.",

The investigation screen is done in a form of top-down map where you can investigate different locations and look for clues.\n\nAkira Kawai, a first-year student of a Fudou high-school received a mysterious letter with ominous sketch and the text saying \"I'll be waiting at the Shiomisou inn.\", sender or reason for sending this letter is unknown. Upon reading this himself, Hajime Kindaichi, along with Miyuki Nanase decided to check if there's more to the meaning of the letter or if it's nothing but a prank of a sort. Upon arriving at the Shiomisou inn, which was in a rather secluded and silent place surrounded by mountain on one side, and a sea on the other, he noticed there are only three more guests besides them. Could one of them be the sender of this letter? The night came swiftly and the weather turned gloomy. There and then, Hajime runs into Kengo Akechi, a detective investigating a report of a supposed seeing of a killer in the area from a 10-year old case. With approaching storm, the scream echoes through the hallway and first in the series of murders engulfs this hotel in an aura of tension. Kindaichi and Akechi are now more than ever determined to get to the bottom of this and catch the murderer behind this.",
