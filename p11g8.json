Starring in the titular role of Shamus, you will have to find your way through over 120 rooms in this cross between Berzerk's \"robots in a maze\" action and Adventure's exploration of a predefined game world.\n\nThe elusive villain's henchmen will express their disapproval of your plans in rather strong terms, namely with showers of bullets. What's more, once they're dead they don't necessarily stay that way: each time a room is re-entered, a random selection of them will respawn. The Shadow has also arranged for electrified walls throughout his compound, so bumping into them will prove quite lethal.\n\nThe labyrinth of chambers is divided into four levels, with multiple locked doors that'll have you wandering around in search of the right keys. If you tarry too long in the same room, a bulletproof Shadow (taking a page from Evil Otto's book) will drop by to discourage loitering.",

      "description": "Unlike Activision's earlier remake of an Atari arcade classic, Battlezone, this one stays close to its namesake.  Take the original, Atari coin-op game Asteroids, add in the features of the Atari 2600 cartridge, then give it 3-D graphics and a bunch of power-ups, and you've got Activision's Asteroids remake.\r\n\r\nYou are an employee of the Astro-Mining Corporation.  Your mission is to simply go to an assigned area of space and clear the area of asteroids and the occassional debris.  The game consists of five zones, each with a different background and some with special features.  Each zone has 15 levels.  In addition to the standard asteroids, there are also mined asteroids that explode; indestructible asteroids that are, well, indestructible; fireball comets; crystal asteroids that regenerate; alien egg asteroids containing deadly baby space worms; and ancient energy asteroids that shoot back!  And there's plenty of enemies in addition to the asteroids, such as Standard and Super Saucers, Asteroids Tugs, Fuel Transports, Hexes, Nuke Drivers, and Vulturoids.\r\n\r\nThere are three types of ships to choose from, each with different strengths and weaknesses.  There are also three skill levels.  If you beat the game at Expert or higher, you gain access to a fourth type of ship.  All ships features the standard laser, shield, flip (instantly flips your ship 180 degrees), and hyperspace.  There are also limited power-ups you can  pick up such as GunSat, Mines, Homing Missiles, Plasma Drill, and Trigger Bombs.\r\n\r\nThe game supports either one or two players.  In two player mode, the object is to simply outscore your opponent in a random zone and level.  You cannot directly kill your opponent by shooting him, but there are other ways....\r\n\r\nLastly, if you shoot the classic-style asteroid in level 15 of the first zone, you'll find the option of \"Classic Asteroids\" now appearing on the main menu.",

Now, over 20 years later, a new Tank has been created based on the technology recovered during the 1978 invasion.  And none too soon, because the Invaders are back!\n\nSpace Invaders is yet another classic arcade game remake by Activision (see Battlezone  and Asteroids).  But this time, Activision licensed a game from Taito instead of Atari.  The game stays close to its roots while adding many power-ups and enemies.\n\nYou can play either one or two players against the Invaders, who march down the screen in orderly rows and columns, at one of three skill levels.  You'll start at Pluto and work your way through the Solar System to Mars, then Venus, and finally Earth.  There are four common aliens (red, green, blue, and yellow), plus seven more less common ones.  You receive special one shot power-ups by shooting four of the same type of Invaders in a row.  As in the original game, there are also Mother Ships that fly above the action, but in this version if you hit them you can pick up other useful power-ups like shields or double shots.  Plus, after fighting off several waves on each planet, you'll face a unique boss.  If you manage to finish the game, you'll be able to play a reproduction of the original coin-op.",

      "description": "<i>Star Wars: Yoda Stories</i> is the second game in Lucas Arts' Desktop Adventures series, which were designed as infinitely re-playable action/puzzle games to be played in short bursts. Set loosely during the events of the first three Star Wars movies (Episodes IV, V and VI), the player takes control of Luke Skywalker who is given pocedurally generated short adventures on every new playthrough.\n\nThe game starts on Dagobah, where the player must find Yoda to be given a randomly generated mission on either a desert planet, a snow planet or a forest planet (or moon for that matter). Missions vary from rescuing kidnapped allies to destroying Imperial bases to finding lost artifacts. As the game's storyline and puzzle design is based around trading or using multiple chains of items, Yoda always gives the player a single item to begin with. R2-D2 can also be picked up on Dagobah and can be used as a tooltip hint activator by dragging him onto any on-screen item or tile. After receiving the mission, the player is free to fly between Dagobah and the target planet with Luke's X-Wing.\n\nWhen exploring the world, the player will come across friendly NPCs who can give hints or trade for items, houses which can be entered, and items scattered around the world. The world is also full of danger. The player starts with the lightsaber, which, when equipped, can be used to defeat Imperial troops, Tuskens or deadly creatures. Enemies can drop blasters, stormtrooper rifles or thermal detonators that the player can use for ranged combat, or rations and medical kits that the player can use to heal themselves.\n\nThe worlds generated can be rather large and filled with secrets and are divided into several key areas such as spaceports where the player can get healed by medical droids, puzzle areas where new items can be found, blockades which require items or puzzles to be solved, as well as teleporters, which the player can use to quickly traverse the world map if they have found the valuable locator item, which displays the world map. The locator also marks areas either solved or unsolved, so it becomes a valuable item to have. The player is allowed some limited manipulation of the game world in the form of pulling or pushing certain blocks, blowing up blockades, using the Force to move items around or even minor button combination puzzles.\n\nThe game is played with mouse controls: moving the mouse cursor holding down the left mouse button makes Luke move, while items and weapons are used by having the desired item in the active item slot and pressing the right mouse button. Alternatively, the player can use the arrow keys to move and the spacebar to use the item. Shift can be used to drag movable items around. The player can create unlimited save files at any time, restart the currently generated world any time when it's still loaded (such as during the game over screen) and generate a new world at any given time and even change the world generator to generate either small, medium or large worlds. The player can also change the combat difficulty and game speed from the options.\n\nIn the original Windows release, the game CD also includes <i>Star Wars: Making Magic</i>, an interactive behind-the-scenes look at the production of the Star Wars Special Edition release.

However, instead of playing as Bomberman, you play as Max, who still is much the same as Bomberman except for looks. The graphics are also slightly different for each level compared to Blue.\n\nThe task stays the same, plant bombs to destroy blocks and enemies in your way, as well as collecting Charabombs, creatures who act much the same as Pok\u00e9mon where you raise the Charabombs and fight against other players. Certain Charabombs and levels are only available in Blue, so you must link with another Game Boy and the Blue Champion Edition to collect all of the Charabombs and complete the adventure.",

Abe's job is to free his fellow Mudokons who are being used as slave labor to dig up the bones of their ancestors. The Glukkons use the bones to make Soul Storm Brew. Abe's vocabulary is limited to \"Hello\", \"Follow me\" \"Wait\" and \"Work\". He must use these commands to direct slave Mudokons to their freedom. When enough slaves in a level have been saved, you go on to the next level to do it all again.\n\nThe game uses a password to save your game. \n\nThe game features both an easy option as well as the normal mode. You also get infinite lives so you can try different ways to get around. ",

You control the fly-like Yar, which can destroy the shield piece by piece by either shooting it or running into it. Once the shield is down, you will need to use the Zorlon cannon to destroy the Qotile. The Zorlon cannon is located on the left side of the screen, and when fired can destroy the Qotile with a direct hit. The Qotile isn't completely unarmed against your attacks, however. Wandering around the screen is a destroyer missile, which will constantly be homing in on your Yar. This missile can not be destroyed, however you can temporarily hide from it in a shield which runs vertically in the center of the screen. The Yar will be unable to fire when hiding in the shield so you can't stay there indefinitely! The Qotiles second weapon is a swirl which it will randomly fire at you and should be dodged. When you finally destroy the Qotile you can move on to the next, faster round of gameplay. Several game variations are included which control the difficulty and speed of the game.",

The surviving humans concluded that they could never repeat their mistakes and build a great tower in the sky to watch over the world and act accordingly to combat \"evil\". One hundred years have passed since then and a hidden cryogenic chamber in the mountains springs to life...\n\n<i>Crystalis</i> is a top-down action role-playing game. Starting from the cryogenic chamber, the player takes the role of a mysterious hero who must uncover the mystery of the tower. The character may equip weapons, armor, shields and globes or bracelets on his body and a single item from his inventory for use in the field. To aid the hero on his quest, four wise people will gradually teach him offensive and healing magic, which requires MP to use. \n\nThe protagonist will also obtain four elemental swords which will help him progress. Each sword can be charged for a powerful ranged attack; if special items are found, this attack can be enhanced for two additional levels. The hero gains experience and gold from defeating monsters. The experience is used to gain levels and improve statistics, however a minimum level is required before one can do damage to specific bosses. Gold is used to purchase items in shops.",

The player has to shoot down the alien, while avoiding to hit the man. Sometimes, the aliens will carry an android, which is similar to the human but deadly. Care must be taken so as to not pick up the androids. All men must be transported to a surface base, where they are put in safety - this is the Dropzone.",

He must navigate various environmental obstacle while defeating enemies with his fists and guns.\n\nSpawn is a platformer with some shooter elements.  It contains both horizontal and vertical sections.  You must make your way through these and defeat the various thugs and occasional bosses.  Mostly, you'll be punching and kicking, but there are some guns with rather limited ammunition to find along the way.  There is also one stage where Spawn rids a motorcycle, somewhat along the lines of the surfing and skating levels in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.\n\nThere are three difficulty modes.  In each mode, enemies can take more damage.  One punch will knock out any minor enemy in easy and you can start at any stage.  It takes two in normal and you must play through from stage one.  On hard, it takes several, so the fighting becomes much more strategic.  You must beat the game on hard mode to get the real ending.",

Before she does, though, she has one final field test to complete - an actual mission in the depths of the South American jungle.  Joanna must infiltrate a hidden cyborg manufacturing facility.  Along the way, she will have her first encounter with the nefarious dataDyne corporation.\n\n<i>Perfect Dark</i> is a prequel to the Nintendo 64 game of the same name.  Players assume the role of Joanna Dark, just before her induction into the Carrington Institute.  The game plays from a top-down perspective, and you battle enemies with a variety of high-tech weaponry, from handguns to rocket launchers. A weapon can be assigned to the A Button and the B Button, which represent your left hand and your right hand.  It's also possible to search dead enemies for items and ammo by pressing Select near their corpse.\n\nPerfect Dark also includes a variety of mini-games which you encounter as you progress through the story.  There are target ranges to practice in, vehicles to drive, sniper rifle sections, which are viewed through the sniper scope, and more.  There are also boss battles against enemy cyborgs, helicopters, and other deadly enemies.",

Kage Mishima, the archenemy of the clan,  has stolen the magical sword Daikatana, which allows the one who wields it to bend the fabric of time and change reality. In addition, Mishima's minions kidnap Hiro's friend Mikiko. He must rescue her, travel to different time periods, and put an end to Mishima's ambition.\n\nThis version of <i>Daikatana</i> is quite different from its PC and console counterpart, being a top-down action game with puzzle-solving, somewhat similar to Zelda games, though with less character customization and more focus on dungeon-crawling. Two companions eventually join Hiro; some of the puzzles can only be solved with their aid. The dungeons, which represent locations of different cultures and time periods, usually conclude with boss fights.",

Unknown to the scientists however, The Mind has secretly been infiltrating computer networks around the world. When the project is finally deemed complete, OCP puts The Mind in control of the security systems of Delta City. At the same time, a gang war erupts in the city and several laboratories are broken into and looted. The police recieve a lead on a gang leader named \"Nexx\" who may be involved and assign RoboCop, a cyborg law enforcement officer, to bring him in.\n\n<i>RoboCop</i> is primarily a top-down action game. Robocop can move up, down, left and right across the map. Enemy units should be shot at to engage, while civilian units need to be protected. RoboCop's objective varies by level but typically involves destroying a particular enemy or finding \"evidence\" items scattered throughout the level. Each level is made up of several maps screens. Between missions RoboCop returns to the police station where he can consult with his ex-partner Lewis, review the station's news or talk to Dr. Lazerus, the scientist in charge of cybernetics.",

      "description": "<i>Metal Walker</i> is a mechanical take on Pok\u00e9mon, where the story takes place in the future on an island where a mysterious element called core has been discovered.  This \"core\" element was used to create a highly advanced race of robots called Metal Walkers that are used for both labor and protection for the people of the island.  One day, however, a gang of robots decide to rebel and end up killing a very prominent member of the island.  The player then takes control of the son, Tetsuo, with the help of Dr. Hawk and Tetsuo's Metal Walker in an attempt to hunt down the rebel robots and avenge his father's death.\n\nThe gameplay is very similar to Pok\u00e9mon, where the player explores various areas of the island searching for clues called Data Packets and battling other Metal Walkers or wild Walkers called Metal Busters, but instead of capturing these walkers, the player instead destroys them.  Destroying these other Walkers results both in scrap metal and items called Capsules that can be used to upgrade or \"evolve\" Tetsuo's Walker into a more advanced form.  Additionally, the player can take the scrap metal to the Junk Shop where they can also be turned into capsules as well.  Additionally, capsules can not only contain power-ups, but traps as well that can be used in battles.\n\nThe battles are also different, whereas this one the attacks consists of rolling attacks that are angled off of the walls of arenas.  Additionally, if a player fights multiple opponents, all of the enemies will be present on the screen at one time and if they choose the right attack and angle, can result in multiple hits on multiple opponents.\n\nThere are also three types of Walkers: Land, Marine, and Sky where, just like in Pok\u00e9mon, susceptible to the other (ex. Land walkers have advantages over Marine walkers but are vulnerable and weaker to Sky Walker attacks).  Base camps can also be built around various areas of the island and can be used for restoring the health of the players Walker.\n\nAs the player progresses farther into the game, they will encounter over 100 different Walkers, each with their own strengths and weaknesses as well as bosses that have to be defeated in order to access more areas of the island.  Players can also use the Link Cable to both battle their Metal Walkers or even exchange their base camps.",

Ordered to board the massive ship and investigate the situation, they find themselves inside a nightmare: a massive infestation of xenomorphs. The mission is clear: clear the ship of hostiles and rescue any survivors.\n\n<i>Aliens: Thanatos Encounter</i> is a top-down action game taking its main inspiration from the second film in the <i>Alien</i> franchise. While usually the goal in any of the more than a dozen levels of the game is simply to survive and find the exit, in some levels certain objectives must be achieved. These may be simply killing all aliens and rescuing all survivors, or finding a keycard to open the level exit. Before each level, the player can choose from five different characters, all rated differently in speed and stamina (i.e. health). Should a marine be drained of health, he or she is not killed, but captured. Another character can attempt a rescue and is given 200 seconds. If the captured soldier is not found within that time span, that character is removed from the roster for the rest of the game.\n\nTo fight the aliens, the marines can draw on a variety of guns, most of them featured prominently in the movie. Besides a standard-issue pistol, there are shotguns, pulse rifles, flame throwers, grenade launchers and smartguns to be found in the levels. Available from the start is the motion tracker radar, displaying both human survivors as well as hostile aliens. It requires a free hand, however, so the use of either two guns simultaneously or one of the heavier guns is not possible with the tracker equipped. Another item reappearing from the movie is the power loader (famously controlled by Ripley in the finale). Its use slows down the marine, but increases their health at the same time.\n\nThe enemies include the entirety of the alien life cycle, from facehuggers to chestbursters, a variety of adult alien warriors, and a queen. At the start of the game, they only hurt the player by running into them, but at later stages they gain the ability to spit acid. Lost health can be regained by collecting and using first aid kits.\n\nGame progress is saved through the use of passwords.",

Cities consist of six different buildings, which the player has to try and prevent their destruction. If all the buildings are destroyed, the player loses the game. \n\nBoth missile silos are equipped with fifteen missiles each and can be fired independently of each other. Players aim their missiles by moving a cursor to the desired location. \n\nThe Game Boy version of the game was later re-released for the Game Boy Color. This updated version included color graphics and added a rumble feature.",

A while ago the station vanished but now it is back on full collision course towards Earth. Of course humanity sends squads out there to end the threat, but everyone but the robot Evo gets lost. The player takes the role of Evo who has to solve 35 levels in order to save Earth.\n\nThe unique characteristic of the game is that Evo has the ability to take control over any robot animal he meets. In fact, he is required to do so because his life energy rapidly decreases when outside of a host. All those animals have different abilities which are used to solve the numerous puzzles found in the levels. There are varying goals to complete in each level which range from destroying a machine to guiding sheep to their pens.",

      "description": "Play as the child Cody, whose grandpa has just retired and is leaving him with the family business, a Robopon Dispatching Company. The player starts with one Robopon, named Sunny, and must travel Porombo island as he/she collects Robopon and uses them to battle other Robopon Collectors. The collectors primarily played against are known as the \"Legend 7\", who are the top-ranked collectors of Robopon on the island. When Cody beats a Legend 7 member, he takes their rank.\n\nTo improve Robopon, they must be upgraded by adding software or other parts to them. Each part has a certain amount of space for storing software and will determine what attacks can be used by the Robopon. Software can be mixed to generate special attacks.\n\nUltimately, <i>Robopon</i> plays a lot like Pok\u00e9mon. Fighting is turn based and is between two Robopon owners who tell their Robopon to issue attacks or go on the defensive. Robopon can be healed in mid-battle with spells (which can be bought in town shops or stumbled upon between towns) or taken to a Robopon dispatch center and healed in their machine. One thing where <i>Robopron</i> differs from Pok\u00e9mon is that in battle, a defeated Robopon sometimes will drop add-on items which get claimed by the winner. When a new game is started, the game asks for the player's birth date which is actually used by the game to select the first Robopon the player will start with. \n\nIn Japan, <i>Sun Version</i> was released alongside Star Version and can connect to that version via infrared sensor. There are 153 different kinds of Robopon, and only by trading between versions can all of them be collected in one save.",

      "description": "<i>Power Rangers: Time Force</i> for the Game Boy Color is a platformer based on the 2001 version of the long-running franchise. In this incarnation, the Power Rangers are time police from the year 3000. Various criminals have escaped to different time zones and the rangers must apprehend them.\n\nThe game takes place over eight levels. For some levels, the order in which to take them on is up to the player. Locations include cities in present day, past and future, a prehistoric jungle, a futuristic underwater base and more. At the start of each level, the player can select from one of five rangers (Red, Yellow, Pink, Green and Blue), all of which differ slightly in the stats vitality, skill, power and speed. The goal in each level is to find and defeat the escaped criminal within a time limit. On the way there are monsters to be fought and traps to be avoided. For defeating enemies or removing obstacles, the rangers can choose between their fists, a fighting staff or a gun. The staff and gun drain energy which slowly refills on its own but can also be refilled quickly by collecting the appropriate powerup. Other powerups include a health refill, a clock that takes time off the time limit, and the ranger warp system, which allows the player to change their ranger mid-level.\n\nStarting in level three, simply defeating the boss is not enough: once he is down, the Power Rangers must use their Megazord mech (in either Red or Blue forms) to beat him again. These battles are similar to a traditional one-on-one fighting game.",

      "description": "The game based on the pod racing scenes from <i>Star Wars: Episode I</i> received a unique adaptation on the Game Boy Color.\n\nThe game features 5 different planets with 4 tracks each for a total of 20 tracks. Only the first track from each planet is available from the start and the only available pod racer available to select is Anakin Skywalker's. Winning races unlocks further tracks on each planet and allows the player to choose the racers of the beaten opponents. When all four courses from a planet are won, a duel against Sebulba opens up. Winning it unlocks Sebulba's racer, but losing another race takes it away again. All racers differ in top speed, acceleration, turning rate and body strength (i.e. amount of damage the racer can take).\n\nRaces are seen from a top-down view and are always one-on-one. Unlike in the film or the console game, there are no laps and the first racer to cross the finish line wins. When normal top speed is reached, a flashing light indicates that a turbo boost is available that allows the racer to reach its real top speed. The turbo shouldn't be used for more than a few seconds, though, because overusing it damages the racer. Crashing into the opponent or track obstacles also causes damage. Too much damage causes the racer to blow up, but the only real effect is some time loss, since it is put back on the track after a few seconds. It is possible to repair damage mid-race at the cost of speed and acceleration.\n\nThe game offers a two-player mode via link cable and the cartridge has a rumble feature.",

One day, a young man named Shigeki uses his D-Shot and is accidentally transported to another world which is inhabited by various cell phone-owning monsters called Denj\u016b. The Denj\u016b love to battle one another, and are willing to team up with humans who can help them hone their skills. These humans are known as T-Fangers, and Shigeki decides to become one and help solve problems in the Denj\u016b world.\n\nShigeki starts with a single Denj\u016b partner, and can befriend more by exchanging phone numbers with ones he has defeated in battle. Up to three of Shigeki's Denj\u016b can participate in a single battle, but since only the starter Denj\u016b travels with him, he will need to call the others and invite them to join the fight. Depending on where these other Denj\u016b are stationed, it can potentially take several turns before they've arrived at the battlefield. A Denj\u016b may have one of six elemental alignments, each of which trumps another in a rock-paper-scissors-style succession.\n\nDenj\u016b can evolve to become stronger and gain new attacks, and there are three methods of doing so. Natural evolution takes place once a Denj\u016b has hit a certain level threshold. Mod evolution happens when Denj\u016b are fused with certain items, and while it is easier than other forms of evolution, it typically provides the worst stat gains of any method. Finally, experimental evolution occurs when a Denj\u016b is fused with DNA samples from other species.\n\n<i>Power Version</i> is one of two versions of <i>Telefang</i>, the other being Speed Version. The two versions have different sets of available Denj\u016b, though players with different versions can trade with one another to complete their collections. Certain area layouts and puzzles also differ between versions.",

These humans are known as T-Fangers, and Shigeki decides to become one and help solve problems in the Denj\u016b world.\n\nShigeki starts with a single Denj\u016b partner, and can befriend more by exchanging phone numbers with ones he has defeated in battle. Up to three of Shigeki's Denj\u016b can participate in a single battle, but since only the starter Denj\u016b travels with him, he will need to call the others and invite them to join the fight. Depending on where these other Denj\u016b are stationed, it can potentially take several turns before they've arrived at the battlefield. A Denj\u016b may have one of six elemental alignments, each of which trumps another in a rock-paper-scissors-style succession.\n\nDenj\u016b can evolve to become stronger and gain new attacks, and there are three methods of doing so. Natural evolution takes place once a Denj\u016b has hit a certain level threshold. Mod evolution happens when Denj\u016b are fused with certain items, and while it is easier than other forms of evolution, it typically provides the worst stat gains of any method. Finally, experimental evolution occurs when a Denj\u016b is fused with DNA samples from other species.\n\n<i>Speed Version</i> is one of two versions of <i>Telefang</i>, the other being Power Version. The two versions have different sets of available Denj\u016b, though players with different versions can trade with one another to complete their collections. Certain area layouts and puzzles also differ between versions.",

      "description": "<i>NYR: New York Race</i> for the Game Boy Color is a futuristic racing game inspired by the 1997 French film <i>The Fifth Element</i>. Unlike the version for console and PC, the handheld presents the races in a top-down view with less features and options.\n\nThe game consists of several divisions of 2 tracks each. Only the first division is available from the start, others are unlocked by placing first in all races of earlier ones. At the beginning, only the taxi (as driven by Bruce Willis' character in the film) can be used. Further cars must be purchased with money won in the races (by placing first, second or third). Eight different cars are available to buy, differing in ratings for power, traction and shield strength. The more powerful cars can only be bought upon reaching higher divisions. Progress through the game is stored via passwords.\n\nRaces are against three opponents, take place on circular courses and consist of four laps. The futuristic hovercars have the ability to change altitude, either driving on the ground or high in the air. Flying high is necessary for maximum speed, but there are obstacles on the track that can only be passed by driving under them. There are also power-ups that can only be picked up when on the ground. These include missiles, shields, speed boosts, slowdown bubbles and short-time invulnerability. An arrow is always in view and points out corners and, when in high altitude, obstacles.",

      "description": "Play as the child Cody, whose grandpa has just retired and is leaving him with the family business, a Robopon Dispatching Company. The player starts with one Robopon, and must travel Porombo Island as he/she collects Robopon and uses them to battle other Robopon collectors. The collectors primarily played against are known as the \"Legend 7\", who are the top-ranked collectors of Robopon on the island. When Cody beats a Legend 7 member, he takes their rank.\n\nTo improve Robopon, they must be upgraded by adding software or other parts to them. Each part has a certain amount of space for storing software and will determine what attacks can be used by the Robopon. Software can be mixed to generate special attacks.\n\nUltimately, <i>Robot Ponkottsu</i> plays a lot like Pok\u00e9mon. Fighting is turn based and is between two Robopon owners who tell their Robopon to issue attacks or go on the defensive. Robopon can be healed in mid-battle with spells (which can be bought in town shops or stumbled upon between towns) or taken to a Robopon dispatch center and healed in their machine. One thing where <i>Robot Ponkottsu</i> differs from <i>Pok\u00e9mon</i> is that in battle, a defeated Robopon sometimes will drop add-on items which get claimed by the winner. When a new game is started, the game asks for the player's birth date which is actually used by the game to select the first Robopon the player will start with. \n\n<i>Star Version</i> was released alongside Sun Version and can connect to that version via infrared sensor. There are 153 different kinds of Robopon, and only by trading between versions can all of them be collected in one save.",

Besides employing 2D graphics appropriate to the platform, it features different tracks and a limited selection of modes and cars.\n\nThe game includes five different cars (all of which handle differently) and nine tracks. Only the first track can be chosen from the start. Subsequent tracks are unlocked by placing third place or higher in a circuit race on the previous track. Once a track is unlocked, it can also be used for a time trial race.\n\nThe races are shown in a pseudo-3D bird's eye view, with tunnels and signs sometimes obscuring the racers. A major gameplay element is picking up power-up icons: the turbo icon delivers a short speed burst, necessary for beating the competition. There is also a grip icon that temporarily improves handling. Oil slicks on the tracks should be avoided.",
