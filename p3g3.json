      "description": "After the 20th century, humankind reaches its hand out across the stars. Seeking to escape the overcrowded chaos of Earth, the United Nations builds a single seedship, the UNS Unity, and sends her on a mission towards the Alpha Centauri star system. After a long journey in cryogenic suspension, the Unity reaches Alpha Centauri where the Captain is killed under mysterious circumstances. Suspecting the motives of one another, the officers and the crew split into 7 factions, each lead with a distinct ideology and motives that they seek to build the planet in their image...\n\n<i>Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri</i> is best compared to Civilization II, but features many distinct differences in gameplay and thinking. In Civilization, the objective was to evolve a society from primitive tribes, whereas Alpha Centauri starts with the landing of colony pods on a barren planet with society becoming fractured. Each faction (aka nation) receives it's own share of the Unity's resources and tech base. For the basics, bases produce nutrients, materials and energy. Nutrients are required to feed to population, Materials are used in production and energy represents the commerce effect which can be traded to players diplomatically or spent on improvements. The 7 factions each have their own agenda, which is determined in large part by the Social Engineering. This enables a faction to customize its values, earning a bonus for what it considers important and a penalty for what it doesn't. Social Engineering system are discovered through research, the same as other improvements, such as structures and units.\n\nResearch is divided into 4 types of technologies, which form an intertwining tree of dependencies. They are: Conquer (direct military applications), Explore (indirect technologies for units and bases), Build (direct infrastructure application) and Discovery (Science for the sake of science, indirect applications). Because of the separation, factions can focus on what they hope the intended result of their science will be, and can be changed at any time. To explore the planet, units are needed. Any unit can be customized out of known technologies; consisting of a chassis type, reactor, weapon, armor and special abilities. Each of these components has a different expense, with untested technologies having additional overhead (prototype). \n\nFinally, Alpha Centauri is not a desolate star system. There is life on the planet, in the form of alien fungus that litters the ground and strange creatures such as mindworms. Initially hostile to all factions, this form of life holds its own secrets and effects on the world at large.\n",

You can engage balloons and blimps, enemy fighters and bombers, even strafe group targets such as supply trains. If you do really good in the game, one of the enemy aces may drop a note to challenge you to an aerial duel. \n\nA unique feature of the game is the capability of modem link so you can challenge fellow modem owners to dogfights, something that none of its contemporaries had.

Through investigation, Interstel determines that the Spemin technology is not their own and that they have obtained it from somewhere on the other side of a flux (wormhole). Interstel commissions a force to visit this area, called the Cloud Nebula, and find a way to nullify the Spemin technology.\n\n<i>Starflight 2</i> is a space exploration game that contains much of the interface from its predecessor. This includes crew management, ship improvement, resource collection, planet landings, alien diplomacy and exploration of a new galaxy. Much of the gameplay takes place via a standard interface that allows access to ship stations. Landing on a planet however will shift to an overhead view and the player manually controls his rover while searching for objects of interest. \n\nNew to <i>Starflight 2</i> is trading, alien races will now buy and sell unique items at different prices, it is no longer necessary to return to the Interstel starport to sell resources. As mentioned, the galaxy itself and the alien races that inhabit it are also new. New technologies exist for the player such as Blasto Pods (torpedoes); a devastating weapon, and Jump Pods; which will transport anywhere on the starmap.",

Join either the Wolf Clan or the Jade Falcon Clan as they pursue their own agenda against the Inner Sphere and other Clans. Take your advanced Omnimechs into battle against all comers. Win high warrior ratings (by using less mechs or smaller mechs than needed, completing secondary objectives, etc.) and you'll get chance at a promotion trial where you face superior odds in an arena. If you win, you advance in rank. If you are very successful, you can make it all the way up to Khan, leader of the Clan.\n\n<i>Mechwarrior II</i> was developed in-house by Activision as the successor to their original Mechwarrior. While this time there are no dynamic campaign and mercenary actions, the Clan culture is integrated into the two campaigns. Different clans have different mechs and different rules, even different weapons. You can customize your mechs in order to use less than the \"par\" force in order to get a higher rating. The game features full 3D environments. The addition of NetMech allowed users to fight each other online. \n\nWhen 3D cards came along, special versions of the game were created to take advantage of 3D texturing.",

      "description": "A long time ago, a great empire comprised of Humans, Velox, Thrynn and Elowan ruled the stars. The Empire's currency was an energy source called Endurium. But something happened and this empire is no more. Furthermore, the small colony world named Arth has forgotten this heritage and technology. A thousand years have since passed and the people of Arth have rediscovered archaeological evidence of their empire. Using these discoveries, they create spaceships and form the Interstel corporation to govern the fleet. It's time to take the first steps back into space... but could it be the same enemy that destroyed the Empire still exists?\n\n<i>Starflight</i> is a space exploration game with role-playing elements. The game is completely non-linear, allowing the player to venture to any star system and explore any of the vast amount of available planets. The main plot is advanced by following cryptic clues either received as transmissions at the initial spaceport, or obtained as a result of successful communication with various alien races populating the universe. \n\nThe player must first form a crew, assign their positions and customize the spaceship before blasting off from spacedock. Besides the captain of the ship, a science officer, a navigator, an engineer, a communicator, and a doctor have to be assigned to the ship. The player can choose between Humans, Velox, Thrynn, Elowan, and Android races when creating the characters. Each profession usually has a racial counterpart with the highest proficiency in it. Except Androids, members of every race can be trained in their skills by spending the game's currency. In the starting location the player can also acquire better weapons, armor, and shields for the ship, as well as outfit it with cargo pods. Terrain vehicle can be customized as well.\n\nOnce out into space, the standard interface allows access to different crew members and navigation. The entire galaxy is unknown and it's up to the player to travel to distant planets to explore and land on them. Planets may be inhospitable, with harsh weather conditions and various terrain types. Using a top-down interface, a planetary lander will venture out with the task of  finding minerals and biological data to transport back to Starport.  These resources can be sold for MU, the game's currency. \n\nDifferent alien races control the galaxy and it will be up to the player to approach them diplomatically or face them in combat. Depending on the communicator's skill, the player may conduct successful conversations by assuming different postures, requesting information, or answering questions posed by the aliens. Each race has a different attitude and requires different approaches to peacefully end the negotiations. If all else fails, or if the player so wishes, the player-controlled ship may engage the aliens in combat, which is presented as overhead arcade action sequences. Successful exploration of the galaxy and alien cultures will yield clues and new leads as to the fate of the Empire.\n\nThe Amiga version adds an auto-mining command. The Genesis version has updated graphics and sound, and is different in several aspects: locations of minerals and artifacts are different; there are new weapons for the ship and upgrades for the terrain vehicle; landing on planets is no longer automatic and must be controlled manually to avoid crashing; terrain vehicle exploration is more realistic, with visible weather conditions and various terrain types slowing down the vehicle.",

This seed becomes his daughter, and her guardian will be watching her progress.\n\nIn <i>Princess Maker 2</i> the player assumes the role of a father to the blessed daughter of the heavens. For the next eight years, the hero will nurture and guide her in the path of the player's own choosing.\n\nIt is possible to choose the path of the zodiac-influenced daughter by scheduling her to jobs and schools, which will raise her statistics (strength, combat skills, cooking, faith, etc.) Each month allows the player to designate three different tasks for her to follow. Balancing between character development, stress level, health and financial income is the focus of this game.\n\nMini sub-quests and various plot options revolve around  the young lady adventuring in the wilderness, provided that she's strong enough to tame the wilds. The player can equip her with armor and weapons to fight off wandering random monsters in turn-based combat.\n\nThe game starts with the daughter at age ten, from which point the player guides her until her adult years. Choices made during the course of the game will determine her eventual marital status, accomplishments and her relationships with other people. There are 74 unique endings in the game.",

      "description": "<i>Afterlife</i> is is a humorous strategy game similar to SimCity where the afterlife is subject to market-based economy. The player has to make it work by managing heaven and hell simultaneously.\n\nIn both hell and heaven the player constructs zones which deal with one of the seven capital sins respectively the corresponding virtues. Through the gates new souls arrive regularly which were sinful or virtues in one specific aspect. These go to the appropriate zones to receive their gifts or punishment - but only if the player constructed a street system. If there is no place left they wander through hell/heaven which is of course bad for business. After some time they get sent back to the home planet. These souls are the source of the player's income. \n\nOf course these facilities also need personnel. These can be either hired or trained by building special training facilities. There are also additional things the player has to keep in mind, e.g. the satisfaction of each soul and the energy supply. Every buildings has to be micro-managed by adjusting their settings but there is also the possibility to use a tool which does it automatically - for a price. \n\nRandom disasters like \"Birds of Paradise\" (excrement rain down on the facilities) break the economic circle and challenge the player to repair the damage. Besides the free playing mode there are also five scenarios where the player has to solve certain tasks.",

      "description": "<i>X-Wing Vs. TIE Fighter</i> is the third game in the X-Wing series of Star Wars space combat simulators from. The game contains a suite of multiplayer modes supporting up to 4 players over the Internet and up to 8 players on a LAN. \n\nThe game also features a completely re-written game engine and introduces  stronger AI, more sophisticated scripting, enhanced graphics, and a CD audio soundtrack. The multiplayer component requires an in-depth scoring method to balance player skill and craft configuration/armament.\n\nThe plot is deliberately vague as the focus of the game is on multiplayer (both free-for-all and team-oriented, including co-op vs. NPCs). Rather, the missions are somewhat generic and reflect typical combat scenarios such as attacks, raids, escorts, base defense, meeting engagements, etc.\n\nGameplay remains true to the series signature style of dogfighting in space. The Star Wars universe portrays such combat in a way that is obviously inspired by World War II air and naval combat, and as with all games in the series, the simulator places a premium on situational awareness and demanding flight controls.",

As Connor Sinclair, you're leading the Democles Commando team lance, part of the Eridani Light Horse, on the attack. The op went terribly wrong when one of the two drop ships was hit during descent, and your lancemates have been scattered to the four winds in the frenzied drop. You must attack through Clan territory, meet up with your lancemates, remove any resistance in your path, and try to find a way off the planet, while also accomplishing what you came to do: destroy the Smoke Jaguars! \n\n<i>MechWarrior 3</i> features detailed mechs (they limp when legs are hit, and destroyed limbs spark and trail wreckage) with slow and ponderous movements, as 100 ton mechs should. Firepower and precise application are the key in winning your engagements. Plenty of mechs are available. You start in a 55-ton Bushwhacker and work you way up to the really heavy stuff in a 20-mission campaign. Full multiplayer is supported with Internet play at Microsoft Zone. Your MFB has limited capacity so you'll need to decide what supplies to keep or dump for your salvage. You'll need to track ammo, weapons, equipment (like heatsinks), and the mechs. Keep the MFB safe or you'll have even less room! Redesign mechs to utilize newly captured weapons or adapt to the changing ammo situation.",

Each and every guest has his own excitement and nausea tolerance, which will reflect on the rides' popularity and the park's tidiness. Hence, handymen are employed. Rides can also break down, and some of them can even crash, leading to a tragic ending. Mechanics can be employed to inspect rides for possible errors and to fix already broken rides. Security guards prevent vandalism in their line of sight, and entertainers keep guests happy while waiting in a long queue line. \n\nGuests are also impressed if there is some wonderful scenery scattered around the park, leading to an increase in the park rating. They all have their opinion on the park, so it is a good idea to check their thoughts every now and then, as the park rating depends on the guests' satisfaction.\n\nAll these features require money. Loan can be raised from a bank, but the more one borrows, the more the bank asks in return. Certain rides, or even the park itself, can also be advertised, while vouchers are also available for discounts or free rides or food.",

Many different cars to try (most you'll recognize). Will you save the day? \r\n\r\nAlso includes pratice modes such as Practice, Carnage (cause as much damage as you can), Dirt Track (time trials), Pursuit (you chase someone), Survival (4 super cops chase you), Lose the Cop (avoid that one cop on your back), and Drive About (just drive about the city and admire the scenery). \r\n\r\nGame also includes a full director's mode, allowing you to place cameras to catch the best moments in the custom replay file. \r\n",

It is 1941, and Germany is launching Operation Barbarossa: the invasion of Russia. Finally, a game that captures the magnitude of this epic, 4-year-long battle that ultimately sealed the end of the 3rd Reich! \r\n\r\nAs with the previous CC games, this one is incredibly researched. The sounds of the dozens of different weapons, the hundreds of unit types, the terrain... it is just amazing how much work went into drawing the sprites and the maps. Units can panic, be pinned, suppressed, surrender, regroup... you name it. There are flame tanks, snipers, bunkers, city fighting, winter/summer battles, different weather conditions, mine fields... pretty much anything that might normally happen on a battlefield can happen in this game. And the best parts: it covers the entire Eastern Front battle from 41-45, and it has good multiplayer support.\r\n\r\nI mean... if you play the Germans, your guys speak German, and if you play the Russians, they speak Russian. You just don't get more realistic than that. :)",

Also, the game features several non-flyable aircraft: B-17 (F, G), B-24, B-26, Mosquito, Ju-88, He-111, Ju-87 Stuka, and Me410!\n\nThe game is meticulously detailed. The physics of flying are accurately modeled, the markings on the planes are historically accurate, and the map takes into account the curvature of the earth.\n\nYour wingmen speak German if you fly for the Luftwaffe, and speak with an English or American accent if you fly for the RAF or US. When you play a \"career\", the choices of units to fly in are actual historical units and you will attack the same targets they attacked. Your unit will even refit with new types of aircraft when they did historically (P-51B to P-51D, for example)!\n\nThe game is highly customizable. You can turn on or off: wind, stalls, the torque effect on single-engine planes, black/red out, engine overheating, structural limits, mid air collision, etc.\n\nYou can attack tanks, trains carrying guns and tanks, ships (freighters and destroyers!), halftrack/car convoys, and lots of other types of ground targets. Pretty much everything can shoot back.\n\nIt also features several newsreels that show familiar black & white footage from WWII documentaries, complete with narration.",

      "description": "Christopher Blair, \"Heart of the Tiger\" had retired to a farming planet after the war, content with retirement, so he says... In the depths of space, a new menace has surfaced. Some unknown attackers are killing civilian ships. The tension between the Confederation and the Border Worlds is at an all time high, as both sides accuse the other of staging the attacks. Admiral Tolwyn has recalled Blair back to service, where he will make the most difficult choice of all... And contemplate action he had never dared before, in the name of justice...\n\n<i>Wing Commander IV: The Price of Freedom</i> is a mix of interactive movie and space sim. The game has a dynamic mission tree, which means the player's behaviour will determine the next mission. The videos feature real actors, like Mark Hamill, Tom Wilson, John Rhys-Davies and Malcolm McDowell. Before the start of each mission, the space craft can be equipped with different weapons. Sometimes the mission objectives change during flight, and the player has to make decisions what he wants to do next, e.g. help out his friend or destroy an enemy fighter.",

Earth has been invaded, and you and your tank lead the defensive effort. You drive around the battlefield from a first-person view, targeting and firing at tanks, planes and UFOs. You have a radar to help you see where the enemies are in direction and distance. Objects can be used as strategic cover. Controls simulate the tracks of a tank realistically, so the direction and speed settings are varied - combining forward right and backward left movements (as you can on keyboard versions) sees you change direction more quickly.",

The Dark Intellect has learned, and it is hiding in the outer edges of the Solar System, learning, observing, and waiting for the perfect moment to strike. Meanwhile, the Human Empire is tearing itself apart. The decree by Emperor Petresun, the original creator of Prometheus, to defend Earth first, while practical, does not sit well with the colonists of other planets, who remember how helpless they were during the previous Earthsieges, and how Earth never sent any help until it was too late. When the brutal crackdown began, the Martian Resistance has formed. Prometheus found his chance to strike when the Emperor ordered his Imperial Knights to attack the Martian Resistance, and the Starsiege has begun... \n\n<i>Starsiege</i> is a battlemech vehicle simulation. The battlemechs in the game (called <i>HERCs</i>) have shields, meaning that the player needs to coordinate the weapons to bring down the shields, then punch through the armor. The weapon mounts are different sizes, making it possible to fit different types/sizes of weapons to them. The other mounts for equipment (engine/shields/powerplant) also have different sizes, limiting/challenging the player's outfitting decisions. Other equipments include shield amplifier, cloaking device, ECM, and more. There are multiple sizes of HERCs available, as well as some ground vehicles (which cannot be shielded). The player is also able to load the camo scheme into a paint program and edit it. It is possible to play the campaign on either the human or the Cybrid side, as well as join other players online in large-scale multiplayer battles. \n\nThe European release of this game features the complete game Starsiege: Tribes as a free extra.",

      "description": "<i>Sid Meier's Colonization</i> is a strategy game which puts you in the role of Viceroy of the New World. You are sent by your King and country to establish colonies in the newly-discovered Americas that lie to the west. You face many of the same challenges that faced colonial organizers of the time-competition\nfrom other Old World powers, strange native cultures, the problems of establishing profitable trade programs, and the problems of organizing an army from a rag-tag band of colonists.\n\nThe game begins with the European discovery of the Americas (1500) and continues until approximately the time of the American\nRevolution (1800). In the beginning of the game you are given a trading/exploration ship and a small group of colonists. You have no knowledge of what lies ahead of your ship, so you must explore until you find a suitable spot to lay down your first colony. As your\ncolonies grow larger and larger, you inevitably encounter native populations and are confronted with competing imperial powers from the Old World.\n\nEach of your colonies is populated by a number of colonists, who you can assign to various tasks. Some chop wood, mine for ore and collect plants outside the colony, some others stay inside to turn those raw materials into more valuable cargo - such as rum (made from sugar), coats (made of furs) or hammers (made of lumber). Hammers which aren't a cargo you can sell, but represent the speed with which you construct new buildings in your colony. Some colonists are specialists, and thus are more effective at a certain job. \n\nThe cargo you collect and produce is an important thing. You can take it to Europe to sell, and earn money to buy some other necessary things, hire colonists (though new, willing colonists appear in Europe by themselves) or buy ships and artillery. You can also trade it with the Indians or colonies of other nations. \n\nYou'll construct various buildings in your colonies. They have a lot of different functions: some of them can improve the speed with which you produce valuable cargo, others allow you to defend yourself from attacks more easily or construct ships and artillery. Some buildings require you to spend a number of valuable Tools when constructed, though you can make new Tools out of ore. \n\nAs you explore the land, you'll come across the Indian villages and some \"places of interest\" which can be investigated. A colonist that enters an Indian village can be welcomed with open hands, and the natives will reveal a map of nearby lands, or teach him a profession. Investigating places of interest has various consequences: sometimes you'll find nothing, sometimes you'll be killed for trespassing on ancient burial ground, but sometimes you'll find treasure! (Taking this treasure to Europe can be difficult though - if you don't have a sufficiently big ship, the King will agree to transport it for you... if you give him 50% of the gold). \n\nTo defend yourself from enemies, you'll want to have some military units. Just give a colonist a musket and he'll turn into a Soldier, give him a horse, and he's a Scout or a Dragoon. However, such a warrior is typically inexperienced, though he might gain military experience in battle. Artillery is also good at defense, but don't try to leave your colonies with it - in the open field, it is useless. \n\nAs you progress in the game, you'll feel that working for the King is getting more and more annoying, especially since he keeps raising your taxes, thus decreasing your income from sold goods. Your colonies produce \"Liberty Bells\", which increase rebel sentiment in the colonies. If the majority of colonists supports your yearning for freedom, you can declare independence. But when you do that, you'll have to deal with the King's expeditionary force arriving to teach you a lesson. If you manage to defeat all his incoming armies and emerge victorious from the American Revolutionary War, you've won! ",

      "description": "Following the Border Worlds conflict of Wing Commander IV, the galaxy is once more at peace. Colonel Christopher Blair, hero of the Confederation has transferred into the Naval Forces. Blair helps design the TCS Midway, a state-of-the-art multi-role carrier that will help keep order during the Confederation's new peacetime. The luxury of peace allows Confed to retire many older pilots and assign younger pilots to piloting roles. Lance Casey and his friend Max \"Maestro\" Garrett are two such pilots, fresh from the academy, transferred aboard the TCS Midway along with several others for its maiden voyage along the borders of Confed Space. But soon into the mission, the Midway intercepts a distress call from the Kilrathi, the remains of a race of cat-like warriors who lost the war with the Confederation...\n\n<i>Wing Commander: Prophecy</i> is a space combat simulator. Players take the role of Lance Casey on his new assignment aboard the ship. The player can click various hotspots aboard the ship to engage in non-interactive FMV conversations with shipboard personnel. By entering the briefing room, players can receive full instructions on their next mission.\n\nSpace Combat begins by launching from the TCS Midway carrier, and are displayed as first-person perspective inside the cockpit, similar to the rest of the Wing Commander series. Mission objectives vary between escort duties, patrol missions, search and destroy or defense of the TCS Midway herself. Depending on the ship being flown for the particular mission, the player will be able to switch between guns, missiles, torpedoes and mines with which to combat the enemy. The player, as wing commander, can give orders to nearby wingmen and communicate with any other ship. After each mission, the player must return to dock with the TCS Midway and will receive a mission performance rating.",

CIA have received tips and clues about some suspicious activities of some known bad guys. Gather enough evidence through house search, wiretaps, etc. Decode any messages you discover to unravel additional clues. Each operation will be handled by multiple people. Figure out the crime before it happens and get enough evidence to find the true mastermind behind the whole thing. Then chase down and arrest the suspects via car chases or go into the house arrest the suspect yourself. Can you arrest all the masterminds? \n\n<i>Covert Action</i> is best described as a secret agent simulator, with a heavy dose of puzzle and some top-down shooter action. You'll follow the hints all over the world, surveil suspect safehouses, apply wiretaps (which is a puzzle sequence), even go inside and check each and every drawer without arousing suspicion (by keeping very quiet). If you're discovered, you'll need to avoid car chases or you'll end up shooting it out with the bad guys. You can also \"tail\" a suspect (with multiple cars) and see if you can find another safehouse or more headquarters to search for clues. You have a silenced pistol (or Uzi) and three different types of grenades, plus other high-tech toys. As you get closer to the mastermind, the plot gets more intricate, timeline gets shorter, code breaking is tougher, and enemies harder to take out.",

      "description": "You're a transportation manager in this game. You choose your starting landscape (Europe, toy land, South America, desert) and your skill level. In this game you can build different transportation lines, like transporting coal to a coal power plant, or oil from the oil wells to the oil refinery. There exist ships, trains, buses & trucks, helicopters and trains. The game has an isometric graphics engine and a jazz-style soundtrack.\n\nThe <i>Deluxe</i> version contains new features that were not present in the original  Transport Tycoon: the time scale of the game became larger, including futuristic vehicles such as monorails; and the editor is much more advanced, allowing you to create entire maps with terrain and cities positioned the way you like. Also, there are some new scenery themes, such as snowy and desert areas.",

      "description": "Following on the footsteps of its predecessor, <i>USM 98</i> brings the series to a new level while keeping the same presentation and style characteristic of the series. \n\nThe biggest change when compared to <i>USM 2</i> is the implementation of all leagues in the same executable, which allow players to jump between England (all five nationwide leagues), Scotland (four), Germany (both Bundeslligas and the Regionaliga), Spain, France and Italy (two divisions each). Signings were also changed, and now require a number of faxes between the clubs and the player, which can delay a transfer by two weeks. \nPlayers now also have positions, defined by skills. A player with high tackling is a defender, both high tackling and passing is a defensive midfielder, and so on. By intensive training a player can be adapted successfully to a new position, and there's also a favorite side, which makes the difference between an attacking midfielder and a winger. On the downside, players no longer have a personality trait. With the exception of the player's potential (which defines the speed a player, particularly young, increases his abilities), everything can be edited using the in-game editor. \n\nThe rest of the game remained mostly unchanged, from the interface, composed by static pictures of several offices where options are reached by clicking on hotspots (like a TV for the teletext, where in-depth statistics can be consulted) to the financial options, where the player is given the lot of land close to the stadium to build stores for both marketing and merchandising.

      "description": "The year is 2067, and the Earth's resources are nearly depleted. In search of raw materials essential for the survival of the humans, powerful corporations send explorers into a region of space known as the Frontier. However, upon arriving there, the humans find out that they are not the only ones needing resources. The alien races who had invaded Earth nearly seventy years ago have their own claims for the Frontier, and it looks like there can be no peaceful solution for the situation.\n\n<i>X-COM: Interceptor</i> has elements of strategy, but its primary gameplay style differs from most previous installments in the <i>X-COM</i> series, focusing on space combat simulation and resource managing. The player commands an elite force of starfighters sent to protect the human corporations in the Frontier. As the X-COM commander, the player must manage space stations, resources, and finances of the organization. Researching alien technology is also necessary to ensure the safety of the humans.\n\nWhen an enemy craft is spotted, the game's mode switches to space combat simulation. The player pilots starfighters, co-ordinating their wingmen, similarly to Wing Commander: Prophecy. Mission objectives usually involve destroying or capturing enemy ships, sabotaging alien trade routes, escorting friendly ships to specific locations, and raiding alien bases.",

In the darkness, a battle between ships has woken up something ancient, powerful, and deadly. \n\n<i>Wing Commander: Privateer</i> is a space trading and combat simulation. The player assumes the role of a privateer. Start with the lowly scout, and upgrade to one of the three other superior ships: Galaxy (superior cargo space), Orion (superior protection), or Centurion (superior offense). Buy optional equipment such as armor, engines, shields, weapons, launchers for torpedoes/missiles, and more. Take on missions (multiple sources, from the cheapest mission computer, to fixers who has the toughest but most rewarding missions) and earn money for upgrades. Use spare cargo room to trade commodities to further add to the account. Missions can vary from search and destroy to Fedex (i.e. delivery) to bounty hunting, and more. \n\nThe game is set in the Wing Commander universe, but is more of a free-form game similar to Elite. While there is a central plot, the player can deviate from it somewhat and can continue playing the game after completing the main story missions.",

It features the most of the same options, including the ability to change between realistic or more arcade-ish controls by reducing roll, adding unlimited ammo or make the Hind indestructible. Gameplay was changed to fit the differences between the fast and maneuverable Apache and the slow and rock-solid Hind - Instead of relying on speed, Hind pilots must be prepared to take all openings possible to attack and focus on avoiding missile fire (as the hull can take machine gun and even cannon rounds happily). Several viewpoints are available, from pilot or gunner to several external views.\n\nThere are three campaigns, Kazakhstan (where you face a similarly-equipped enemy, pro-independence rebels), Afghanistan (the Mujaheddin, mostly foot soldiers armed with machine guns, rockets and the odd AAA but in a very hilly terrain) and Korea, where you can skirmish against American equipment. Campaign missions range from fixed target destruction (such as a bunker or a fuel depot), troop deployment (or evacuation), attack enemy positions or even lasing a target for the MiGs. There are day, night and foggy missions, where you have to rely just on instruments for navigation, making pre-mission planning (you can edit the flight plan to include more waypoints, or move them to go round or over a mountain, for instance) more important. \n\nEach campaign include 10 scenarios that can be played by their own, along several training missions (which are crucial to get the most of the helicopter). Netplay is included, and given the similarities between Hind and Apache, owners of each game can go head to head together.",

You have the standard race, with one big difference - now there are traffic cops out to ticket you for your excessive speed. Alternatively, you can take your turn with the radar gun and attempt to pull over speeding computer or human racers. \n\nReturning to the flavour of the original Need for Speed, this adds a new Pursuit mode, where you must out run the cops through fast, open area tracks, while also out-lasting the rest of the pack. Another new mode is knockout, where you race through all the tracks, and whoever is last after each race is knocked out. The winner is, of course, the one that lasts the distance. Almost every course in the game has one or more shortcuts. \n\nThe cars include Ferrari 550 Maranello, Ferrari 355 F1 Spider, Italdesign Scighera, Lamborghini Diablo SV, Lamborghini Countach, Jaguar XJR-15, Jaguar XK8, Aston Martin DB7, '98 Corvette C5, Mercedes SL600 and the Mercedes CLK GTR.",

You are once again the mayor, but this time you can fully customize the terrain before building your city. The graphics are isometric, whereas the original had graphics displayed in a top-down fashion.\n\nThis title adds numerous features over the original such as the ability of building \"light\" zones, subways, hospitals, colleges, zoos, and arcos which are actually cities in cities. You can now give names to places, and your city is surrounded by neighboring towns with which you can make trade. Finally, instead of the poll in the first game you now have the option of reading several newspapers to get an idea of your progress.",

      "description": "<i>Theme Hospital</i> is a level-based hospital management simulation where players have to start on an empty building, and then assemble rooms with all kinds of material, from desks and file cabinets for the general diagnosis to the expensive ultra-scanners and x-rays to diagnose such bizarre diseases such as Bloaty Head, Slack Songue or Alien DNA, and treat them with with even more bizarre machines like an Head Inflator or a DNA fixer. There several additional rooms, such as a staff room for your employees to rest, a toilet so that patients don't have to relieve themselves in the corridors, a research department to get the most advanced diagnostic and treatment technologies and a training room where consultants can teach a thing or two to rookies, making them capable doctors. The size and layout of each room can be set by the player, according to the available space. In addition to rooms, the player must provide radiators, seating for patients and drink machines.\n\nHowever, rooms don't run by themselves. Most diagnostic and clinics can work with regular doctors, but others like the operating theater and the research room require specialized staff while the ward, pharmacy and the fracture clinic require an attending nurse. At the same time, the hospital can't run without handymen cruising around the hospital to water up dry plants, clean up litter and vomit (after all, people go there because they <i>are</i> sick) and fix machines, while receptionists direct patients to the proper rooms.\n\nAs levels advance, the player faces increasingly harder situations: VIP visits, emergencies, epidemics and earthquakes, which can either take a toll on reputation or on the bank account. On the other hand, as more and more equipment is required, additional plots of land are available for purchase in later maps.",

      "description": "<i>Deadlock: Planetary Conquest</i> is a 2D turn-based 4X strategy. Players take the roles of aliens deadlocked on a planet surface. The game has seven different races with special abilities, for example the Maugs are great scientists, ChCh-T have the highest birth rate etc. They spend turns building, expanding, and ultimately warring. The planet's surface is divided into smaller areas. Each area is home to one of the cities that need to be constructed. To colonize a new area, the player must build a colonizer. Players can expand their cities by erecting residential buildings, farms, factories, mines and research centres. Inventions made in the latter provide new units, new materials and better buildings (for example a hydroponic farm is far better than a normal farm). The residents' satisfaction is important - dissatisfied citizens (taxes are too high) protest and don't work.\n\nThe battle begins after the player places their units in a foreign land. Battles are separately animated - after being initiated players have no control over them. The game also has a spying mechanic that spies can use to steal technologies. The player wins by fulfilling one of the victory conditions, for example remaining the last living race on the planet, or reaching a set number of city centres first.",

      "description": "<i>Across the Rhine: 1944 - 1945 Armored Combat in Western Europe</i> is a mix between strategy and simulation game set during WWII. The game focuses on single tank battles during the Allied invasion of Normandy - this means the player can't influence the overall outcome of the war. The battles are mostly historically accurate but some of them use hypothetical situations.\n\nThe basic situation however is always the same: the player is in charge of tank battalions and tries to defeat his enemy. The player is presented with several windows which show different information, e.g. a tactical map, a strategical map or a battlefield from a tank's view. The size and position of these windows can be freely arranged. From these windows he also gives orders to his tanks, e.g. assigning waypoints or changing the behaviour. All this is in real-time. The player has also the opportunity to directly take control over a tank - there he has the choice between several viewpoints, including the driver's or gunner's view, and controls movement and turret. Optionally the AI can take care of the movement. This part of the game is more simulation than action game.\n\nDuring the three campaigns the player takes control over both parties. He assembles a soldier which, depending on the battle performances, gets promoted during the course of the game which results in the command over more units. There are also many options to set the realism of the game in different areas, e.g. manual fuel distribution, limited ammo, morale, air support or even invulnerability. ",

An unknown menace, with technology beyond both ours and Vasudans, are destroying both sides. And now, old enemies must unite to fight this common enemy, and the dissenters and traitors on both sides.\n\n<i>Descent: Freespace</i> is a space dogfight simulator. The game features a vast amount of weapons, missiles and bombs, as well as large capships. It also has online multiplayer. Take fighters and bombers on attack, recon, escort, and sweep missions against enemy capships and fighters and bombers. Defend your own capships and other assets. Your rating and performance is noted after every mission, with suggestions (if applicable). You can call in reinforcements (if available), and your wingmen actually do fight intelligently, as there can be dozens of fighters flying about. \n",

As an officer of the Commonwealth it's your job to strip these rebels of their defiant natures and force them to re-join with Earth.\n\n<i>Independence War: The Starship Simulator</i> is a space-sim with a twist. Instead of flying the usual fighters, you take charge of a 150-metre long Dreadnaught-class corvette. And all the goodies of a capital ship are included: big guns, big shields, lots of missiles. All the daily essentials for an officer of the Navy. \n\nMission times vary from 5 minutes up to 35 minutes without save point. If you have successfully completed the mission, the game will save. There are primary and secondary missions and, later in the game, you can change the sides from the Navy to the Indies. Later, the Dreadnaught become updated with more firepower, new missiles and a friend. The game has three endings.\n\nSome of the missions require you to remote control other crafts, such as fighter, freighter, and more. Unfortunately, when you are controlling that ship, your own ship is flying with no one at the helm.",

The manual is quite detailed, and combined with the in-flight tutorials, the user is provided with a very gradual introduction to flying.\r\n\r\nA very comprehensive piece of work, and a defining title for Looking Glass, whose only competition at the time was Microsoft Flight Simulator (which look immediately dated compared side by side to Flight Unlimited).",

      "description": "It has been 32 years since GTA lost contact with Earth. As a young pilot joining the fleet of the GTVA (Galactic Terran-Vasudan Alliance), you will be fighting the Neo-Terran Front, a rebel faction that opposes GTA's alliance with the Vasudans. Then the Shivans showed up again... \n\n<i>Freespace 2</i> is basically an enhanced version of Freespace. You get better ships (you can fly all the older ships if you like), more and more powerful weapons (both guns and missiles), and capital ships that can actually put up a fight with their anti-fighter beam cannons, turrets, flak, and missile launchers. \n\nThe capital ships now also engage each other with large beam cannons that shoots beams wider than your craft; these beams can shoot through enemy ships. Contribute to the fight by flying  bombers (with large anti-ship torpedoes) or fly defense and take out the enemy bombers. Fly escort missions to protect assets, recon enemy assets, test new weapons, even fly a few missions for spec-ops (optional). \n\nThe game features full multiplayer support at PXO (Parallax Online) and SquadWars.com, with co-op, team-based, or free-for-all dogfight, with many different missions to choose from. It also includes FRED2, a full featured editor that you can use to create your own missions and campaigns. ",

However, the joyous occasion is also seen by domestic and international terrorists as a soapbox for their demands, and it's up to SWAT to keep everything going as planned. As if terrorist threats are not enough, two portable nuclear demolition devices are for sale... in the L.A. area.\n\nA tactical FPS, the player is in control of a five man strike team, and it's up to him to guide the other two-man teams to complete each mission, for a total of 16, ranging from dangerous arrests, hostage rescue, VIP escort to track and disarm bombs, while visiting landmarks of the city such as the City Hall or the Convention Center (where the E3 takes place).\nTo help the strike team, each officer has one of four standard-issue weapons to choose from, a sidearm and utilities such as glowsticks, C2 door breaching charges, CS gas, flashbangs and the always useful optiwand, to know what's after the corner and the Leatherman tool, to disable electronic devices and unlock doors.",

The first task is to place essentials such as housing, transport links, schools, factories and shops. There are 50 types of these, allowing for homes of all standards and different types of businesses. Make sure to consider which sites are effective for which tasks. Some power sources pollute, others don't but are more expensive. Taxes must be raised to ensure an income, and then portions allocated to public services such as policing and roads. Earthquakes, floods and fires are all emergency situations that must be dealt to contain any damage.\n\nSuccessful mayoring will cause the small village to grow into a town, then a city and finally a metropolis. As the city's size grows so do it's needs. Commercial buildings may suddenly find that they need an airport to expand trade, or housing may find itself changing rapidly as vast amounts of people come and leave.\n\nThe game also includes 8 pre-defined time-limited scenarios, with specific challenges and targets. The environment varies in each game (especially if you have the Terrain Editor add on), and this should affect your choices.",

In the role of  manager, the player will have to make sure that they are employing the best personnel available in the market: including engineers, designers, mechanics, marketing staff and of course, the drivers, All this within the constraints of the team's budget. The marketing people are responsible for \"wooing\" potential sponsors to the team and to negotiate merchandising deals. The engineers, mechanics and designers, the unsung heroes of a Formula 1 team, have to divide their time between preparing the cars for race day and doing R&D for new parts, driver aids and the next year's chassis.",

      "description": "Captain Kirk and the USS Enterprise are representatives of the United Federation of Planets. Their role in space is that of explorers as well as a military presence. The Enterprise routinely encounters strange adventures and bizarre situations, each laid out as a separate \"episode\" which must be played in order. The first episode involves the USS Enterprise being called to a world to investigate strange \"demons\" have appeared from the mines and begun attacking the settlers.\n\n<i>Star Trek: 25th Anniversary</i> is based on the 1960s Star Trek TV series. The game is a combination of a point-and-click, side-scrolling adventure game and a first person starship simulator. This tie-in actually missed the 25th Anniversary of Star Trek's TV debut by half a year (nearly three years in the case of the Amiga version), but it uses the original series' characters and settings. Players directly control Captain Kirk, leader of the Starship Enterprise, and are able to give orders to other crew members. While the enterprise is on a peaceful mission, combat is possible. A new game begins on the bridge of the Enterprise, seen from a 3rd person view of Kirk, but a first person view out the viewscreen of the Enterprise. When on board the ship, Kirk can contact Chekov to assign a designation, raise shields or begin combat, contact Sulu to engage warp or adjust magnification, contact Spock to scan for data and search for keyword information, contact Uhura to deal with communications, and contact Scotty to change power allocation and repair damage and beam down to a planet.  During combat, the player steers the Enterprise manually and is able to turn in 720 degrees of direction as well as increase or decrease speeds. Weaponry includes phaser banks which draw from the ship's energy and proton torpedoes which are in limited supply.\n\nThe adventuring bulk of the game comes in the form of many landing party missions, in which the player beams down to the surface of a planet and explores the situation. Kirk can move about on the screen, other crew members automatically follow him. From the menu, he chooses a body part to perform an action: eyes represent looking, mouth represents speaking, one hand represents using items (and crew members) while another is to pick up objects. Kirk carries an inventory of items collected which can be accessed and used at any time. In most missions Kirk will carry a communicator to contact the ship and a phaser weapon which can be set to \"stun\" or \"kill\",  The point-and-click adventure has different solutions to problems, but the ideal goal of the federation is to solve things non-violently. Performance is rated accordingly as well as being based on how many extra discoveries and advances made and interaction with different beings, including aliens. The surroundings are all based on styles from the TV series and solutions to puzzles involve the skills of multiple crew members.",

The player is a rookie helicopter pilot that must make his living by transporting passengers and help the city authority in several tasks, including rescuing sims from fires and boat accidents, divert cars from traffic jams, aid on putting out fires and arresting criminals, controlling riots and MEDEVAC injured sims to nearby hospitals.\n\nThe player starts with a basic helicopter, and by completing missions, earn money that can be used to buy larger and faster helicopters and equipment required to deal with more advanced problems (such as a water cannon to put out fires without having to fly directly over the fire and disperse a crowd, tear gas or a megaphone), as well as points to advance to the next level in career mode. The opposite also happens: if a player takes too long to solve a traffic jam, he gets penalized in points.\n\nThere are two game modes: Career makes the player jump from city to city, while the Free mode allows to play on any city, as well as any city created in Sim City 2000.\n\nIncluded helicopters:<ul>\n<li>Sikorsky S-300</li>\n<li>Bell 206 JetRanger</li>\n<li>McDonnell/Douglas MD 500</li>\n<li>McDonnell/Douglas MD 520N</li>\n<li>Bell 212 Twin Huey</li>\n<li>AgustaWestland AW109</li>\n<li>Airbus Helicopters AS365 Dauphin</li>\n<li>McDonnell/Douglas MD-900 Explorer</li>\n<li>Boeing AH-64 Apache</li></ul>",

      "description": "Just like its predecessors <i>Need for Speed: High Stakes</i> is an action racing game with a wide selection of exotic sports cars and many different types of tracks. The trademark Hot Pursuit mode game mode from the first game in the series is still present, where players race opponents on tracks filled with regular traffic and police cars that chase the racers. The classic pursuit mode is extended with two additional modes: Getaway and Time Trap. In Getaway the player needs to shake off the police in a set amount of time, or playing as the police trap a speeder before time runs out. In Time Trap an entire race needs to be completed before time runs out, or as the police all speeders need to be arrested. There are minor differences between the two platforms for this game mode, regarding spike strips, road blocks, and back-up. The latter for instance is unique to the PlayStation version. The Pursuit mode is available in multiplayer as well and players can take different sides or race together.\n\nIt is the first game in the series to introduce a Career mode with a set of challenges. Beating these is rewarded with trophies for unlocks, and money to spend on new cars, repairs and upgrades. In the PlayStation version the Career mode is split up into two different sets of challenges: Tournament (required races) and Special Event (optional races). <i>High Stakes</i> in the title refers to races where players bet their cars. In the PC version these are a part of the Career mode when the player owns more than two cars. In the PlayStation version two players can insert their memory cards and race against each other. The winner immediately receives the opponent's car and it is deleted from the loser's memory card right away.\n\nIn addition to the new game modes it is also the first game in the series to have a detailed physics models. Damage now affects both the appearance and the performance of the car for the first time.",

He explains that the Inca people are dying of malaria and endangered by the European explorers. The jaguar is willing to transfer the hero to the past, where he/she will have to look for the cinchona plant and deliver it to the Inca king.\n\nPart of the <i>Trail</i> series of educational games, <i>The Amazon Trail</i> features a gameplay system similar to the other installments, with adventure and simulation elements. The player will have to choose travel guides, make travel plans, manage supplies, navigate a boat on the Amazon river, encounter many indigenous animal species, take pictures, and catch fish in order to survive the hazards of the journey. At certain points in the game, time-traveling is also available, and the player is able to meet historical characters. Upon the completion of the main quest, players are graded according to their gameplay style, taking into account personal activities, number of animals identified, additional gifts brought to the Inca king, etc.",

The campaign mode features a dynamic war front that is always changing based on the actions of you, your squadron, and all the other squadrons positioned along the Front. \r\n\r\nThe basic idea stays true to the original Red Baron, but with improved graphics, more realistic flight models, smarter AI, and a much larger, vibrant game world.",

Operate behind enemy lines as you gather data, attack enemy camps, capture enemy leaders, take over space stations, and more. Combat happens on land, underground (huge caverns), and even in space. There are plenty of weapons to outfit your gear, even some hand-to-hand weapons. You can also add perks and flaws to further customize your gear. Stealth is a major concern in some missions. The game play feel is very different from the Mechwarrior series. \r\n\r\nSet in Dream Pod 9's Heavy Gear universe (it actually rivals the Battletech universe in complexity, though not nearly as famous), this game requires 3D accelerator with its \"Dark\" 3D engine. The gears are capable of very human-like movements, such as kneeling, crawling, and jumping. \r\n",

Cars from 8 constructors tough it out over 8 circuits of first-person high-contact racing. \n\nYou can race the full championship or take on single races or time trial challenges. At this time the series required all cars to make at least one pit stop during the race. This seriously affects your driving and pitting strategy.\n\nBesides the TOCA races, each of the venues also features special racing events where all drivers race identical cars. These range from the Ford Fiesta to exotics like the AC Blower and the Lister Storm, and higher, in a format similar to American IROC races. 8 bonus track layouts are also included.",

You start in your family's Corellian transports (multiple models) as you deliver cargo and practice gunnery against pirates, poachers (who steal your cargo), and rivals. Later, you will get to join the Rebel Alliance, fight plenty of battles, and eventually make your way to the battle that will destroy the second Death Star!  Adjust power, change weapons, arm lasers and concussion missiles, even jump into a gun turret (for crafts so equipped), adjust power and recharge. There are OVER FIFTY missions for you to make your way through, plus full multiplayer support. You also get a \"souvenir\" from each mission you complete... Very cute. ",

Each building can be customized for its appearance, prices and also the length of the ride. Roller coasters play an important role as the main attraction for visitors. Players can design a custom ride and then test it from a first-person view.\n\nIn this version the park can be built in four different worlds: Lost Kingdom (prehistoric theme), Halloween World (spooky theme), Wonderland (fantasy theme) and Space Zone (futuristic theme). The game boasts 3D graphics and players can walk around in their park as if they were one of the guests, and go on the rides. Golden Tickets can be won by doing great things to the park and these can be used to buy new rides and parks.",

The game features several missions which can be either played independently from each other or in two campaigns for the United States or Japan. The goals are mostly to liberate an area, to defend an area or to destroy a specific target. \n\nThe special feature of this game is that it also can be played as strategy game. On an overhead map the player gets presented with the position of all aircraft and he can order his troops around. The player can take control over every aircraft he wishes to and switch between both modes instantly. He can also record his performance and cut small movies with different camera angles out of them.",

      "description": "Following the collapse of Soviet Union, USA began to dominate the politics of the Commonwealth of Independent Nations. Islamic countries started a global jihad against the Western world, and as a result, petroleum has become an even more rare and valuable resource. In a chain of events, Alaska declared independence, and major powers of the world began fighting over its oil-rich territory. Japan turned into the world's most powerful nation, while United States and the Catholic Church were weakened; by the year 2011, humanity's dreams of unification have become completely shattered, and the fate of the world was decided by mercenary organizations.\n\nSimilar to Wing Commander in gameplay style and visual presentation, <i>Strike Commander</i> is a flight simulator with action-oriented combat. You lead a rag-tag mercenary fighter squadron known as the Wildcats, trying to make a living in a dangerous, chaotic world. Somewhat simplified dogfights in your blackmarket-purchased F-16s are supplemented by interactive cutscenes where you converse with your teammates, or go into town to buy new contracts. \n",

There is only one place you can go to (besides the fact you can stop anywhere), which is Oregon City. You can also only have five or so people in your group. You can hunt, and you can fish, which is a new gameplay element.  You can also go down the Dalles River in a first-person view (along with floating across rivers.) ",

The last vestige of central authority is in the form of the G-Police (Government Police); an independent agency tasked with keeping order in the colonies. You play as rookie Jeff Slater - a former military pilot going undercover at the G-Police squadron on Callisto, in the hopes of finding the truth behind your sister's sudden death.\n\n<i>G-Police</i> is an arcade-style helicopter shooter set inside the colony domes on Callisto. You pilot a futuristic close-air-support gunship, and are tasked with engaging ground and air enemies as you uncover a sinister corporate plot. Your ship can hover and turn in a VTOL mode, fire weapons outfitted before each mission, and lock on to objects in the world to both track enemies and scan suspicious cargo. Missions require you to navigate through the skyscrapers and billboards of the various city districts, and complete a number of objectives updated through radio contact with headquarters. There are thirty-six missions to complete.",

You are in charge of a small province, and hope to make it as peaceful and prosperous as possible, following the advice of your citizens to make it work. The game also features defending your city, by forming an army. and for trade, but you never leave your city. You must pay attention to the Gods, who can inflict disasters if not satisfied. As the game progresses, new technologies become available, which you must allow for.\n\nIt is about people and systems. Each building that you build requires you to hire people; people that you see walking the streets of your town. The marketplace needs saleswomen, and buyers. You see the buyers walk to your granary to buy food, which they then bring back to granary. The sales lady walks up the street selling food to the houses she finds, which allows them to evolve to better housing, which pay higher taxes. The people in this game make the difference. Instead of a police station having a radius of effectiveness, it sends out a police officer who can only fight crime and fires he sees. The need to rely on randomly walking citizens means placement of buildings is as significant as in Serf City/The Settlers.",

      "description": "<i>Ford Racing</i> is similar gameplay-wise to Need 4 Speed: Porsche Unleashed, with the obvious difference of controlling Ford cars instead of Porsche. There are eight versions of each vehicle; two 97 models, two 98 models, two 99 models, and two 2000 models. Each model varies in performance, the slowest being the 97 models and the fastest being the 2000 models.\n\nThe player can compete in single-player mode where he gets to choose the cars and tracks freely if unlocked in the second game mode, the career mode, which is more ambitious. Here the player takes the role of a low ranked driver, starting with slower cars and paving his way to the top. Also in the career mode it is possible to upgrade the tires, suspension, transmission, brakes, and engine of the car, as well as reduce its weight. ",

You also have to connect all the little villages in the province with roads and make some industry, like stone mining, grapes, etc. for which you can then create markets in your city. \n\nWhen you have achieved the necessary requirements, you'll be able to start all over again in a new and more challenging province.

      "description": "The Princess Blue was a trading vessel. While cruising through space, it happened upon a derelict ship floating in space. Only one crew member was allowed to investigate the abandoned ship. Suddenly, Manchi raiders appeared on the viewscreen. The Manchi managed to ambush and destroy the Princess Blue. The only surviving crew member from the Princess Blue swears revenge and is determined to do everything in his power to defeat the Manchi.\n\n<i>Space Rogue</i> is a hybrid game that combines space flight and combat simulation with trading and RPG elements such as interaction with characters and a quest-based structure with a main plot line. Space flight takes place in two different modes: Cruise Flight, which is ideal for travelling quickly, and Newtonian Flight, which works best for combat and precision flying. There are also three different camera views for the 3D exploration and combat. Each planetary system has a variety of destinations and obstacles to travel through via a top-down navigational map. Traveling to an outpost, a space station, or any other location with the star system can be done simply by selecting it and charting a course, or in real-time 3D flight mode.\n\nInterstellar travel between systems, is done by finding a Malir Gate and using it to reach hyperspace. While in hyperspace, the game becomes a simple 'tunnel' game where the player must manually control the ship not to hit any of the walls. Also hyperspace travel eats away at the ship, so the faster the player can get through them, the more armor the ship retains. While traveling in space the ship may get attacked, or the player may opt to assault any other ships first. \n\nIt is also possible to buy and sell various goods, earning money and spending it on outfitting the ship with weapons and various upgrades, such as for example a device that allows it to move more stealthily through space and avoid detection by hostiles. The player character has a reputation rating with various factions such as the Imperium, the pirates, and others. This rating is affected by the player's actions towards them and can be raised or lowered by helping specific factions fight others. \n\nWhen docked at outposts or stations, the view shifts to top-down, and the player navigates the protagonist through the location in an adventure or RPG-like fashion, examining objects and talking to characters. Conversations may have multiple choices, and a few instances require the player to type in keywords, though for the most parts responses are selected from a menu. The game has a main plot line that requires finding, talking, and performing tasks for characters, as well as sub-quests that may result in various rewards such as money or ship upgrades.",

The simulated plane is an F-16C Block 50/52 version.\n\n<i>Falcon 4.0</i> comes with a dynamic campaign, which is full blown strategy game within the simulator itself. As the virtual war developes, the campaign engine moves ground, naval and airborne troops around the battlefield and generates missions for the player.\n",

In this offshoot (pardon the pun) of the series, you are a combat pilot during World War II, for either the RAF, USAAF or Luftwaffe. \n\nEight different planes and the battered cities of Berlin, Paris and London are incorporated. Full cockpit designs and damage models are featured - watch for engine smoke and explosion debris.\n\nThere is a full campaign mode, which takes in the Battle of Britain, defending London during the Blitz, and finishing the job started on D-Day by pummeling ground targets.You can also play individual missions or fly freely. Online multiplayer options allow you to take this worldwide fight around the real world.",
