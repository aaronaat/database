      "description": "After the award-winning NHL 98, EA worked to improve what was considered to be one of the most complete ice hockey games in the market. Along the usual and almost obligatory NHL roster updates, the International mode first featured in the previous version was expanded, allowing players to choose IIHF rules and rink size.\n\nGraphically, the arena is more detailed with more rinkside features, and ice reflections, player faces were improved and stand more seamlessly into the model, enhanced motion capture result in better animated hits (with the ability to break the glass with a well-placed body check making a return), shots and saves, and finally an higher polygon count complete the graphic enhancements to the game.\n\nAs graphic changes aren't enough to make a game better, gameplay was also tweaked, with computer players being smarter, both in offense and defense. Shooting was tweaked (slap shots are easier to pull, players no longer skate in circles to do some backhand shots and must be facing the goal to shoot, particularly in one timers) and a new special move brings dekes, spin-o-ramas and the kind of moves J\u00e1gr, Fedorov and Sel\u00e4nne pull when one-on-one with the goalie. However, if the player gets too close to the crease, the referee might want to review the play in the new video goal judge, so the player must think twice before trying to pull a \"Brett Hull\". For newcomers to the sport, a new Beginner mode allows players to get used to the ice without having to concern with penalties or an overly strong opponent.\n\nThe season mode was also improved, with the players now having streaks that affect either positively or negatively his abilities. Debuting the Nashville Predators, players can either choose to play with their initial roster, or do a fantasy expansion draft.\n\nLike in the previous year, Jim Hughson and Darryl Reaugh liven up matches with play by play and colour commentary.",

Changes done to the 3D engine feature include on the fly in-game management with better player positioning AI (including the goalkeeper), and faster gameplay. An editor to change all player information is included, which affects simulated data: the team with higher ratings has a better chance of progressing through the next stage regardless if it is Brazil or China.\n\nIt's possible to play with the groups as determined by the real draw,  randomize or customize them to the players' likings, mixing both qualified and additional teams. Once the player wins a trophy, the first of the <i>Classics</i> matches is unlocked. These are eight final matches in the competition's history which are unlocked as the player beats them one by one. Friendlies, training matches and practice penalty shootouts close the modes available.",

It's not like watching a football match (soccer American sports fans) where you're constantly in danger of a cardiac arrest because your team need one goal to stay in the Premier League. Cricket is a different kettle of fish all together. Cricket matches don't take hours, they take days. Cricket is all about sitting back and having a rest. \n\nAs is the nature of cricket, you'll either be batting or bowling. Batting is handled by the use of the directional keys and two fire button. Pressing various directions performs different shots.\n\nTo be honest, there seems to be a lot of luck involved. However, if you know your cricket then you'll love the attention to detail and will spend hours refining your batting skills.",

      "description": "Following on the footsteps of its predecessor, <i>USM 98</i> brings the series to a new level while keeping the same presentation and style characteristic of the series. \n\nThe biggest change when compared to <i>USM 2</i> is the implementation of all leagues in the same executable, which allow players to jump between England (all five nationwide leagues), Scotland (four), Germany (both Bundeslligas and the Regionaliga), Spain, France and Italy (two divisions each). Signings were also changed, and now require a number of faxes between the clubs and the player, which can delay a transfer by two weeks. \nPlayers now also have positions, defined by skills. A player with high tackling is a defender, both high tackling and passing is a defensive midfielder, and so on. By intensive training a player can be adapted successfully to a new position, and there's also a favorite side, which makes the difference between an attacking midfielder and a winger. On the downside, players no longer have a personality trait. With the exception of the player's potential (which defines the speed a player, particularly young, increases his abilities), everything can be edited using the in-game editor. \n\nThe rest of the game remained mostly unchanged, from the interface, composed by static pictures of several offices where options are reached by clicking on hotspots (like a TV for the teletext, where in-depth statistics can be consulted) to the financial options, where the player is given the lot of land close to the stadium to build stores for both marketing and merchandising.

The in-game presentation follows a TV-style script, zooming in players while displaying stats during clock stoppages.\n\nAs far as game modes go, in the year of the first Olympic Tournament with professional players, NHL 98 introduced the first real international competition, with 18 International teams to choose from. Other game modes include Season (option to pick between 25 or 82 games) and Playoff (best of 1, 3, 5 or 7 matches) and a Penalty Shootout mode.",

New features for 1998 include more advanced Quarterback functions such as the ability to play lob passes and adjust timing patterns, and more instinctive AI features to adjust as the match goes on. Squad features have also been advanced, with the opportunity to create plays and trade them.\r\n\r\nGameplay is much the same as the other editions, with the full season on offer as well as playoffs and the Superbowl. Everything is presented TV-style, with play-by-play analysis and reports. The contemporary NFL teams are joined by great squads of the past.",

This follows pioneering ideas in the Sim-series such as Building a city, using a helicopter to keep them running smoothly and guiding an entire planet from birth to death.\n\nThe MouseSwing control mode sees your player deliver his shot, complete with back-swing and follow-through, based on your precise mouse movements, with the aim of reflecting golf mechanics more authentically. A more conventional three-click mode is also offered.\n\nA complete course designer is included. It can generate randomized terrain layouts for you to fill in with hazards, such as water hazards, bunkers and trees, as well as lava and other unrealistic novelties.\n\nInternet and LAN options to take on up to 3 others exist. There are six different views on shot replays.",

Players engage in a futuristic street-hockey style game played out on the interior of an elongated ellipsoid arena.  Body-checks (weapons are included) go for blood in this game as players can be gruesomely eliminated from the game, including the option to score with an opponent's dismembered head. Power-ups, speed boosts, ramps, and simple team management (for substitutions) are all part of the experience.  Some strategy is required for play, but it's mostly pure action.\n\nThe game also features multiple skill levels, 12 teams (from a US tournament league), and head-to-head network play (IPX and TCP LAN only).\n\nIf you are looking for a 3D version of Speedball, this is as close as it gets.",

      "description": "The official video game of the Games of the XXVII Olympiad held in 2000 in Sydney. It includes 32 nations, going for gold in 12 events divided by 6 sports: Athletics (100m dash, 110m hurdles, hammer and javelin throw, triple jump and high jump), Aquatics (200m freestyle and 10m platform diving), Kayak K1 Slalom, Super Heavyweight Weight Lifting, Skeet Shooting and Three-man track cycling pursuit. All events feature 3D graphics with cameras that mimic the ones used in TV broadcasts.\n\nGameplay is the usual found in games of the genre - button mashing the two power buttons is required in most events to build up strength/speed, with an additional third button setting the actions, such as jumping or throwing angle. Other events feature alternate control methods, such as Slalom (where it's possible to press certain buttons to dodge the rower between the gates if the Kayak is going to hit one or place the paddle to force into a certain direction),  Diving (following a \"click-along\" sequence of keys) and Skeet (the direction keys controlling the aim, one button to start and other to shoot).\n\nAlong an arcade and 8-player action, the Olympic mode gives the player the option to build their athlete from the national open trials to the Olympics. By completing training drills in the Cyber Gym, the athlete increases his athletic abilities: <i>Citius, Altius, Fortius</i>, as told by the Olympic Motto. Before joining the competition, the player must beat national, continental and international opponents.",

You take charge of 1 or more football teams, and aim to lead them to glory by signing the right players, selecting the right formations and tactics, and keeping your squad and chairman happy.\n\nThis edition features teams from 15 major leagues - Brazil, Sweden and Japan are among those featured for the first time. You now have reserve and youth teams, in which you can play trialists and try out young players - the assistant manager can handle these games if you wish. New to the <i>Championship Manager 3</i> game engine is a training system, allowing you to specify which skills groups of your players (such as defenders, reserves, or those returning from injury) concentrate on.\n\nThe game takes a while to calculate results and other AI team decisions, but for the first time the game has an integrated multi-tasking system, allowing you to make decisions and browse other squads while this is taking place. The game engine also now includes network play,\n\nIf you are successful, you will be rewarding with the ultimate accolade - the chance to manage an international team. This involves scouring clubs to find eligible players, and then selecting squads to play in World Cup / European Championship / Copa America matches, as appropriate.",

      "description": "The main differences of the 1998 version of MS Golf compared to its predecessor are the enhanced graphics and sounds. \n\nIn this version there are three eighteen hole courses, the Bay harbour Golf Club, Casa de Campo Links, Teeth of the Dog and a nine hole course The Preserve Nine, making sixty three playable holes in all. The game is highly configurable, for example each match can be played with ten difficulty settings, ten different scoring variations including stroke and match play, skins, scramble, bingo bango bongo, and teams. Other configuration options include customising the player, changing the weather conditions, using a two or three click system to control the swing, playing the full course, the front nine, back nine or practice holes and much more.\n\nEach hole has a fly-by preview to aid the golfer and there are optional windows such as the vertical view which gives a birds eye view of the hole and the flight of the ball.\n\nMultiplayer games are possible via a direct modem link, network LAN, and the internet over the Internet Gaming Zone which the in-game help describes as \"a site on the World Wide Web that connects, or \"matches up\", players from all over the world for various types of computer games\".\n\nThe CD contains a folder called 'Goodies' in which there are alternate models for the golfers - these have to be installed manually, Windows NT4 service pack three a requirement for multiplayer gaming under that operating system, and Microsoft System Information ( a tool for gathering system configuration information to help Product Support engineers solve system related problems)",

      "description": "<i>Carnivores 2</i> is a hunting simulation in the vein of Deer Hunter. Instead of hunting cute woodland creatures however the player gets to hunt big, hungry dinosaurs. The story is set in the far future and mankind has mastered galactic travel. On a distant watery planet we discover species completely identical to Earth's ancient dinosaurs living quite happily on a series of lush islands. Being the enlightened galaxy-spanning species that we are, we decide to bring in a bunch of big-game hunters to blow their brains out and bring em' home stuffed and mounted.\n\nIn the PC version there is a total of nine huntable dinosaurs, as well as several additional species which serve to populate the environment. The latter can be shot too, but they are not rewarded with kill trophies. The game is set in an open environment played from a first-person perspective. The dinosaur-hunting company has provided a gun, a map, some binoculars, a \"dinosaur call whistle\"  and a license to kill things. The player travels through woods, climbs mountains, and even picks through the decrepit remains of deserted research outposts in the search for the next kill. The game requires a tactical approach. Dinosaurs have keen hearing, sight, and smell and will run away if they detect the presence of a hunter. Often a downwind approach is needed, and the hunter needs to hide behind a rock or tree, and uses a mating call to lure them in for the perfect shot. Of course the highlight of the game is the challenge in hunting hunters, the carnivores.\n\nCarnivores will stalk the hunter whether he is hunting them or he is just passing through their territory. The whistle's herbivore mating call or the sound of gunfire may inadvertedly alert them to the hunter's presence and location. Instead of charging head-on into the waiting maw of the shotgun, they can circle through the underbrush, dodging out of sight and ambushing from the sides. Despite their aggressiveness they are not stupid. If the hunter camps out in a clearing on top of a hill with a sniper rifle they will stay in the woods instead of charging out into the open where a clear shot is much easier. The exception to this is the huge Tyrannosaurus, who are disdainful of the puny bullets and will simply charge like an oncoming freight train.\n\nThe hunter starts in the woods with a pistol stalking herbivores. Each killed dinosaur earns points which can be spent on better weapons (six in total), new areas such as marshlands and deserts, or the right to hunt a larger selection of dinosaurs including carnivores. The more expensive dinosaurs get fiercer and bigger, and eventually enough points will be earned for the privilege of challenging the T-Rex.\n\nThe iOS, Android and Mini versions are enhanced ports of the original game. Next to the updated graphics it adds the Pachycephalosaurus, Amargasaurus, Oviraptor, Utahraptor, and Troodon as new dinosaurs and Ravaren's Bridge from Carnivores: Ice Age as a new map. From that game also comes the supply ship that picks up the corpses and a photo camera to take pictures of the animals in an exploration-type game mode free of blood. A relocate option allows the hunter to start at a new location during a single hunt. It can be used multiple times and also refreshes the supplies. Next to the the original Hunt mode these versions add a Survive mode where the hunter needs to stay alive as long as possible. The wind locator has been moved inside the compass to make more room on the screen. Most of the new content was not available right away, but added in gradually through updates. The hunter is controlled through a virtual d-pad on the left side of the screen and on the right side two icons can be tapped quickly to call an animal or to draw a gun and aim. For Android an iOS there is a free-to-play version with microtransactions. In the Android version two additional bundles can be purchased to expand the game and access everything, while for iOS there is a separate commercial app with everything unlocked.",

      "description": "The <i>Championship Manager</i> series involves choosing a football team and then leading it through a potential 30-year career. You must deal with signing and selling players, choosing your team and its formation and tactics, and making sure you have the backroom staff (coaches and scouts for example) to keep your existing players fit and ensure you discover new stars first.\n\nThis was the third release of the Championship Manager 3 game engine, and as usual it features squads updated to take account of transfers, and player statistics and abilities updated. 26 leagues from around the world are now featured.\n\nAs typical with later releases of a CM iteration, a data editor has been added. The press will now ask you loaded questions based on the team's performance and potential signings, and you must deal with these by choosing the valid answer. Also, players now interact in different ways, and do not always get on with each other, as well as having more potential reasons to be unhappy.",

The Monaco license is used, although the teams themselves are not licensed. A total of 22 camera views are provided.\n\nTelemetry is stored and analysed in a similar way to Grand Prix 2, and physics are modeled to be realistic. There are eight different modes to race, the new ones being a career mode in which you start with a poor team and must drive well enough to earn competitive rides, and scenarios recreating key races for particular drivers. Returning from the first game are Time Attack, a full championship, and a 50s retro mode. There is also a track editor to create your own tracks. ",

      "description": "<i>Carnivores: Ice Age</i> is third game in the hunting series. This version is set on the Arctic regions of planet FMM UV-32. Scientists of DinoHunt Corp. discovered that animals from the Ice Age still live there and they establish a hunting program. The player roams the planet using a mini-map, a compass and an assortment of guns to hunt down the animals. Unlike the previous PC games this title does not feature any dinosaurs (except for the prehistoric bird diatryma). The game uses the same engine as the previous titles and has five main areas: McRath Island, Ravaren's Bridge, Ring of Infernus, Dry Nodus Lake, and The Giant's Boot\u2014each with their own difficulty level. Just like the previous games animals do not leave behind tracks, despite the snow. The available weapons are largely identical to the earlier versions and include a a pistol, shotgun, rifle, crossbow, double-barreled shotgun, and sniper rifle. The included animals in the PC version are brontotherium, dire wolf, wild boar, woolly rhinoceros, diatryma, giant deer, smilodon (sabre-tooth tiger), woolly mammoth, cave bear, yeti, archaeopteryx, and the pig.\n\nThere are no missions in the game. The player selects what to hunt and the weapon, and then enters an area. It is always possible to leave as well. During the game points need to be earned. They are spent to customize hunts, as certain weapons, areas and animals cost more. Initially, only weaker animals (herbivores) and weapons are available until a sufficient amount of points has been earned. All animals are however able to kill the hunter. As in the previous games tranquilizers can be used instead of bullets, but these do not lead to trophies for kills. Points can also be spent on camouflage, a radar, or to cover scent. Hunting is done with a realistic approach as the animals need to be called to lure them and the player has to position himself against the wind, avoid noises and stay out of sight. The areas are open-ended and once again have a day-and-night cycle. A difference compared to the previous games is that here the weak points of the animals are not shown and they are generally more resistant to damage. \n\nThe enhanced iOS version features ten animals. The hunter is controlled through a virtual d-pad on the left side of the screen and on the right side two icons can be tapped quickly to call an animal or to draw a gun and aim. It also includes the ability to relocate to another place once inside a hunt. This can be done more than once and also refreshes the supplies. The Survive training exercise mode from the previous iOS game is not present. The iOS edition has a free-to-play version where additional animals, weapons and areas need to be bought through in-game purchases, next to a commercial release where everything is unlocked. In the PS3/PSP mini version the killing animations were toned down and corpses disappear instead of being picked up by a dropship.",

Features include exaggerated muscle-bound player models, \"turbo\" buttons, fast action, and some pretty wild rules changes (like 30 yards for a first down!). Blitz is nothing if not a unique football gaming experience.\n\nPlayer taunts (\"This is MY HOUSE!\"), unpenalized late hits, and amusing running commentary from the announcers (\"That was totally uncalled for -- but awfully fun to watch!\") all add to the game's violent charm.\n",
