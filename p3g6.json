      "description": "<i>Death Rally</i> is a top-down racing game where the player can rely on more than speed to be the number one, and brains must be riding along brawn to get the most from each race. \n\nStarting with only $495 and a lowly car, the player must compete in one of three races (picked from 19 tracks) with increasingly difficult opponents but higher rewards, getting enough money to buy new cars, choosing from six models, and enhance them with one to four upgrades for engine (increase top speed), tires (improve traction, allowing to drift less on turns) and armor (reduces the damage caused by opponents, mines or collisions). But there are more ways to spend money by reaching the underground market where the player can buy land mines (can be dropped to get opponents directly behind or create traps in narrow sections), get some rocket fuel (which increases boost speed greatly at the expense of some damage for both the user car and the ones directly behind) or bribe a mechanic to mess around with the best-ranked opponent car. All these upgrades are valid for one race only.\n\nThe race varies in length depending on the difficulty chosen, but follow the same structure: four drivers with the starting grid set according to the championship table, with the worst placed starting in front and so on, and the first to cross the line after the stipulated number of laps wins or the last driver standing wins. At the same time, the fourth place driver gets no points and no money, including pick up bonuses, and lapped drivers get the same luck.  The player can use a booster to increase speed for a few seconds, but once the reserve is depleted, the player has to wait it replenishes or pick up icons scattered on the track. Similar items appear to replenish ammo, repair the car or give small money bonuses. Occasionally, large money and repair items appear, which provide a much larger bonus. \n\nAlong the money earned in races, there are several bonuses if the player manages to wipe out all competition, complete the race without a scratch or completing a streak of wins, or accepting certain missions for some sponsors, such as collecting steroids and win the race or destroy an opponent. The value of these bonus changes according to the car: a bonus with the Vagabond can be worth as little as $650, but with the Deliverator a mission can be worth 12 grand, regardless of the race selected.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to top the championship table, and then defeat   the Adversary in a special track.",

Armed gangs terrorize the roads of the American South West. You are Groove Champion - when your sister Jade is killed you inherit her custom-built Picard Piranha and become a vigilante, with only revenge on your mind.\n\n<em>Interstate '76</em> is a vehicular combat game with a 1970s theme which means muscle cars & funky disco music. Hit the road and seek the killer of Groove's sister in 17 scripted missions across open-ended trackless areas, or battle creepers in the instant melee mode, against up to 7 other human players. The player can equip their car with different weapons, like machine guns, turrets, grenade launchers and mines. Although the game world is not intended to be realistic, the car handling and collision physics are.",

      "description": "<i>Carmageddon</i> is a violent car racing game where the racing element can be equally important as wrecking opponents' cars or gathering kills by ramming into pedestrians. At the beginning the player has only one car and is ranked at #99. The overall objective is to race all the way to the top, collecting the opponents' cars on the way as trophies (and possibly replacements to one's vehicle). In the race itself the player tries to damage opponents by driving into them, and can also kill pedestrians.\n\nDamage, kills and spectacular moves earn credits for upgrades and even making repairs to the car at anytime during the race. If a specific opponent's car is wrecked multiple times in successive races, it is added to the choice of available vehicles. There are many power-ups strewn around the courses that range from useful (more speed, instant brake) to fun and downright absurd. Though the player can win by racing by finishing first, wrecking everything in sight is encouraged. The game offers open environments where exploration away from the racing course is encouraged.",

      "description": "For years, the Toy-Volt company has been producing toys and games for children all over the world. Within months of introducing their first products, Toy-Volt shot to the top! No one could put their finger on exactly what it was that made the toys so popular. Sure, they employed the best designers and marketers in the world, but there was something else about Toy-Volt toys, something almost.... magic. Now, their newest R/C cars really start to live! \n\n<i>Re-Volt</i> is a racing game where you take control over one of more than 28 R/C cars and drive on one of the 13 tracks. The tracks are varied, and include a toy shop, a supermarket, a luxury liner and more. It is possible to play a \"reversed\" (backwards) or \"mirror\" (reversed left and right) variety of each track. There are also 4 levels of realism to choose from. \n\nThere are a couple of single- and multiplayer game modes to choose from. There's a Single Race, where you complete a single track while competing with several computer-controlled opponents; a Championship, where you try to complete a series of races in hopes of finishing on the top; and Multiplayer, where you play with live opponents. There's also a Time Trial, where you're alone on the track, and simply try to get as best a time as possible; a Practice mode, where you're free to drive around a track to learn its structure and shortcuts; and the Stunt Arena, where you drive around a special arena and try to collect stars situated in hard-to-reach places. \n\nIn Single Race, Championship and Multiplayer there are power-ups scattered throughout the track; picking them up gives you a one-use random power, such as missiles to launch at pesky opponents, a star to temporarily freeze competitors in place or a lightning bolt, which makes your car shock opponents nearby to make them stop.

      "description": "In <i>Grand Theft Auto</i>, the player takes the role of a small-time criminal trying to make it big with the mob. Stealing cars, doing jobs for the gangsters and behaving generally anti-social are the way to success.\n\nThe action moves through six levels spread over three different cities, each based on a real US city: Liberty City (based on New York City), San Andreas (based on San Francisco) and Vice City (based on Miami). To finish a level, a certain score must be reached. Stealing cars and crashing into traffic, driving over pedestrians and killing cops all raise the score, but the \nbig points are made through jobs. Answering phones or entering special cars brings mission assignments, from simple \"ditch-a-hot-car\" jobs to supporting bank robberies or carrying out assassinations. Completing a mission will raise the score substantially and also increase the score multiplier, so that completing the next felony will gain even more points.\n\nCriminal behavior comes with a price of course: if policemen witness a crime, the player's wanted level rises. At the lowest level, a single police car might give chase, whereas at the highest level whole car squads hunt the player, the police set up roadblocks and shoot to kill. The only way to evade the cops is to find a respray shop and get a new paint job with new license plates. This costs money which is deducted from the score, however. But even dying or being arrested are not the end. The player has several lives, and ending up in jail simply results in being stripped of all weapons and armor and the score multiplier being lowered.\n\nThe entire action is viewed from a top-down perspective, which zooms out while driving a car, for a better overview at high speeds. The cities are many screens large and can be freely explored. Crates are scattered over the cities, which might include weapons (from pistols to rocket launchers), armor or other bonus items: extra lives, police bribes (used to reduce the wanted level to zero) and get-out-of-jail-free cards (used to retain score multiplier and weapons when busted). Dozens of different vehicles are available for the taking, each with unique characteristics: a bus will handle very differently than a sports car.",

      "description": "In the third major installment of Electronic Arts'\nArcade racing series, there are several modes of play available. You have the standard race, with one big difference - now there are traffic cops out to ticket you for your excessive speed. Alternatively, you can take your turn with the radar gun and attempt to pull over speeding computer or human racers. \n\nReturning to the flavour of the original Need for Speed, this adds a new Pursuit mode, where you must out run the cops through fast, open area tracks, while also out-lasting the rest of the pack. Another new mode is knockout, where you race through all the tracks, and whoever is last after each race is knocked out. The winner is, of course, the one that lasts the distance. Almost every course in the game has one or more shortcuts. \n\nThe cars include Ferrari 550 Maranello, Ferrari 355 F1 Spider, Italdesign Scighera, Lamborghini Diablo SV, Lamborghini Countach, Jaguar XJR-15, Jaguar XK8, Aston Martin DB7, '98 Corvette C5, Mercedes SL600 and the Mercedes CLK GTR.",

      "description": "<i>Die Hard Trilogy</i> lets players guide New York cop John McClane through three arcade-style games based on each of the three <i>Die Hard</i> movies.  Each movie is represented through a totally different style, making this a \"3 games in 1\" style package. \n\n<b>Die Hard</b> is a third person action/adventure through thirty floors of the Nakatomi Tower high-rise. Terrorists have interrupted the company's Christmas party and taken hostages.  As McClane, the player must search for hostages through computer, construction, maintenance, and executive levels. McClane's default pistol holds infinite ammo, and the player can collect limited-ammo machine guns and grenades inside the levels. Walls turn transparent when they intersect the camera, allowing players to follow McClane through hallways and rooms with ease. After all the hostages on a level have been rescued, the player has 30 seconds to locate a bomb sent down by elevator, then use that elevator to move to the next level. \n\n<b>Die Hard 2: Die Harder</b> is a first-person arcade gun game, nearly identical to Virtua Cop. Terrorists have attacked Washington/Dulles Airport. The player automatically moves through the airport and surrounding areas \"on rails,\" shooting bad guys that appear from behind the scenery.  Weapon upgrade icons can be shot to be collected, and either use limited ammo, or are retained until the player is hit (identical to Lethal Enforcers). Players can also destroy parts of the environment by shooting it, which can be used to take out nearby terrorists (with explosions, or by shooting overhead items to drop on them).  This game supports pad controls, or any of the PlayStation's gun controllers.  \n\n<b>Die Hard With A Vengeance</b> has players racing through New York City streets in a variety of vehicles, trying to locate bombs before they explode.  A strict timer ticks off the next explosion, and the player is guided only by a direction arrow and the vocal suggestions of their co-driver. Bombs are hidden inside everyday objects (like phone booths and benches) and are defused by ramming them, which activates the timer on the next bomb. Occasional \"bomb cars\" must be chased and rammed until their life bar is depleted. Powerups can be collected by running over icons in the streets, and include extra time, turbo boosts, and jumps to rocket over obstacles.\n\nAll three games are exaggeratedly bloody (players can run over pedestrians in Die Hard 3 and wipe the blood away with windshield wipers). Each of the three games also uses a combination of textured polygons and sprites to generate their worlds, resulting in warping textures and some quirky \"paper doll\" effects.",

The cars on offer range from police car and VW Beetle to school bus and truck, each of which has its own strengths and weaknesses - trying to win with the bus, which involves blocking everyone behind the hideously slow vehicle for 3 laps, is perhaps the ultimate challenge.\n\nInitially there are 5 tracks available, with practice and single race modes as well as full championship at 3 levels - winning each of the first 2 levels unlocks an extra track. They all have hazards running through them, and sections where you must make a split-second choice between the safer route and the risky but potentially rewarding one. Multiplayer can be done via network or by split-screen - in a break with convention the screen is split vertically rather than horizontally.",

There are also short cuts to be found.\n\nYou can choose three types of races:<ul><li>Quick Race: against the other 8 pilots in a track of your choice</li>\n<li>Ghost Race: where you race against a \"ghost\" plane, trying to beat your own time</li>\n<li>Championship: where you race the 5 main circuits in order, earning prizes that allow you to buy upgrades to your plane.</li></ul>You can also play against other players via LAN or over HEAT.NET.",

      "description": "Just like its predecessors <i>Need for Speed: High Stakes</i> is an action racing game with a wide selection of exotic sports cars and many different types of tracks. The trademark Hot Pursuit mode game mode from the first game in the series is still present, where players race opponents on tracks filled with regular traffic and police cars that chase the racers. The classic pursuit mode is extended with two additional modes: Getaway and Time Trap. In Getaway the player needs to shake off the police in a set amount of time, or playing as the police trap a speeder before time runs out. In Time Trap an entire race needs to be completed before time runs out, or as the police all speeders need to be arrested. There are minor differences between the two platforms for this game mode, regarding spike strips, road blocks, and back-up. The latter for instance is unique to the PlayStation version. The Pursuit mode is available in multiplayer as well and players can take different sides or race together.\n\nIt is the first game in the series to introduce a Career mode with a set of challenges. Beating these is rewarded with trophies for unlocks, and money to spend on new cars, repairs and upgrades. In the PlayStation version the Career mode is split up into two different sets of challenges: Tournament (required races) and Special Event (optional races). <i>High Stakes</i> in the title refers to races where players bet their cars. In the PC version these are a part of the Career mode when the player owns more than two cars. In the PlayStation version two players can insert their memory cards and race against each other. The winner immediately receives the opponent's car and it is deleted from the loser's memory card right away.\n\nIn addition to the new game modes it is also the first game in the series to have a detailed physics models. Damage now affects both the appearance and the performance of the car for the first time.",

      "description": "Lie, cheat, and steal your way through three districts of a huge city in the follow-up to Grand Theft Auto. Earn the respect of 7 different gangs as you demolish the town in your attempt to make lots of cash.\n\nThe game takes place at an undisclosed time in the near future. Unlike the first game which featured three different cities, <i>Grand Theft Auto 2</i> only features a single town, but it's divided in three districts which are unlocked one at a time: downtown, residential and industrial. Like in the original the player goes around answering phones to initiate various missions. The game uses an overhead camera in a 3D landscape and allows the player to freely explore the city and steal any vehicle the player sets his or her eyes on. To unlock new districts the player must reach a certain score which is done by committing crimes and finishing missions.\n\nBecause the game now features multiple criminal gangs, the player must choose allegiances. Performing missions for one gang, will decrease the player's reputation for another. When the player commits crimes he also becomes wanted by the local police, but as more crimes are committed without shaking the police, they will give way for first SWAT Teams, then Special Agents and finally the army.\n\nNew features include the ability to save at the church, when donating enough money, and various side missions, such as becoming a taxi driver to ear money. There are also many new cars with weapons attached such as a firetruck with a flamethrower and a car with machine guns.\n\nOn the PC version the player can change the time of day from noon to dusk to allow for more moody lighting. On the PlayStation the game can only be played at noon, and on the Dreamcast only at dusk.",

Cars from 8 constructors tough it out over 8 circuits of first-person high-contact racing. \n\nYou can race the full championship or take on single races or time trial challenges. At this time the series required all cars to make at least one pit stop during the race. This seriously affects your driving and pitting strategy.\n\nBesides the TOCA races, each of the venues also features special racing events where all drivers race identical cars. These range from the Ford Fiesta to exotics like the AC Blower and the Lister Storm, and higher, in a format similar to American IROC races. 8 bonus track layouts are also included.",

Others are rally tracks where you go from one end of the track to the other instead of doing circuit racing. \n\nTwo completely different single-player modes available. First, there's factory driver, which have you join Porsche as a test driver. As you complete different challenges, which can vary from doing specific manoeuvres in pre-alloted time to racing fellow drivers, you will make your way up to Ace Test Driver. Second, there's Evolution, which is the \"career mode\", you start with enough money to buy one 356, and start racing. As you win races, time will pass, new cars will become available, or you can peruse the used car market. Buy/repair/sell cars, win races, buy enhancement parts for your car, and make your way to the end of the modern era...\n\nYou can also play online via EARacing.com, where you can pick customized cars in your Evolution stable or choose stock cars and race up to 7 other cars simultaneously. \n\nThe graphics have been enhanced and the physics model changed to reflect a true 4-point system, and you can feel the difference between the different vehicles.

There are eight versions of each vehicle; two 97 models, two 98 models, two 99 models, and two 2000 models. Each model varies in performance, the slowest being the 97 models and the fastest being the 2000 models.\n\nThe player can compete in single-player mode where he gets to choose the cars and tracks freely if unlocked in the second game mode, the career mode, which is more ambitious. Here the player takes the role of a low ranked driver, starting with slower cars and paving his way to the top. Also in the career mode it is possible to upgrade the tires, suspension, transmission, brakes, and engine of the car, as well as reduce its weight. ",

Many tracks are included, along with replays, for reviewing races later, and a garage mode, for tweaking your setup.\n\nThere are also hacks, including the ability to drive planes, but none of these are particularly useful, nor well-polished, except the 'exotic' car. (Most of the vehicle models are incomplete). Viper Racing's physics were very advanced for its time, and the AI, when set to hard, can even get into car-fights with you!",

Four detailed tracks have been created, with a succession of stomach-churning bends and jumps, and you can choose from 3 different cars. As well as the main championship, there is a time-trial mode featuring a ghost car to beat, so you always know how your run compares with your best-ever. Two machines can be linked for multi-player action. The handling of the cars is unrealistic, to put the focus on action and instant playability.",

      "description": "In <i>Need For Speed II</i> the player takes control of eight Super Cars and races his or her way through six different tracks from Australia to Nepal.  Much like the first in the series, the sequel has plenty of high performance cars to choose from, including the McLaren F1, Ferrari F50, Lotus GT1, Jaguar XJ220, Ford GT90, Isdera Commendatore 112i, Italdesign Cala and Lotus Esprit V8, each handling differently.\n\nOnce the player has beaten the six tracks, a new track is made available. It's a fast paced racing game which is intended to play more like an arcade racer than a true simulation, though the player can select which driving style suits him or her best: arcade or simulation. \n\nThere are three game modes: single race, tournament (in which the player must get the highest score in order to win) and knock out (in which the player has to outrun at least one car at the end of each track to avoid elimination). Car settings such as gear ratio, downforce, break bias and color can be customized. The opponents' skill can also be chosen, as well as the presence of civilian traffic in the tracks. The game offers four options of camera views: heli-cam, tail-cam, in-car and road cam. A replay mode with eight cinematic cameras is also available.\n\nThe main difference between this and the previous <i>Need for Speed</i> game is in the tracks, with less open road tracks in this sequel. Also, there are no cops to chase the player. However, the tracks available are have a range of detail, and some have changing weather conditions while the player races.",

      "description": "Grand Prix 3 aims to be a complete simulation of the 1998 Formula 1 World Championship, and features all the tracks, teams and drivers. You can practice the racetracks (which is recommended to learn their layouts and work on car setup) or compete in single races or the full championship. \r\n\r\nEach race weekend has practice and qualification sessions, and the lengths of these can be customized, as can the skill level of the opposition drivers. There are 7 driving aids available, including automatic brakes and gears and an indestructibility option - as you race at higher skill levels, less and less of these are available.\r\n\r\nCar setup is done in precise detail, with the chance to change wing settings (trading off grip against straight-line speed), brake balances (affecting how the car handles under braking) and gear ratios (trading acceleration off against top speed), as well as more complicated ones like packers, dampers and the ride height - the manual explains it in considerable detail, as well as offering driving tips.\r\n\r\nBefore each race you choose your pit strategy and tire compound - those with better short-term grip wear out quicker, especially if your driving style is aggressive. Wet racing is included, which requires much more careful driving and shrewd strategic choices as to which type of tires to use and when to pit to change them.",

There are stunt-tracks, where you have to perform the craziest stunts to earn points, supercross-tracks, where you have to pass the finish line before the others are doing, baja-tracks, where you have to ride a circuit through the wilderness and new enduro-tracks, where you also have to ride through an outdoor location, but each with a special theme. There are a lot of obstacles what makes the scenery very realistic. With the downloadable editor called \"Armadillo\" you can build your own tracks and objects.",

A Crash Course Career mode allows players to take the role of a stunt actor or a taxi driver. The races are short and simple, but the player should expect tight turns and tighter time limits. ",

      "description": "After nuclear war at the turn of the century, the citizens living on Earth in a post-apocalyptic year 2066 are divided into two distinct groups; The Insiders are the descendants of the wealthy corporations responsible for the devastation and live privileged lives inside of dome cities, while the Outsiders are those who live outside the domes, living on the scraps remaining of civilization. Outsider communities tend to degenerate into \"gangs\", who rule through brute force and use their \"Battle Wheels\" combat vehicles to retain control. Most of the gangs are collections of angry, twisted individuals brought together by common goals and a common hatred of everyone else.  Feared by all are the dreaded Red Sixers, crazed cannibalistic mutants created by the negative life energy produced by the dying world. The Sixers, requiring constant sustenance prey on all the other inhabitants of the wasteland.  When the Red Sixers attack and destroy the town of Stadium City, one inhabitant swears revenge. Managing to drive off the Red Sixers' leader, Rant, this young rookie's deeds gain the attention of another gang, The Company. He is recruited into their ranks and sent on a variety of missions to wage war on rival gangs.\n\n<i>Redline</i> is a combination of First Person Shooter and Vehicular Combat game. Players can fight their enemies on foot with a variety of weapons, or hop into an empty Battle Wheels rig and start blowing things up with the vehicle's built in weapons. While inside of a car, the player is able to run over enemies, but while on foot is very much vulnerable to becoming street pizza by enemy rigs. Players can exit the vehicle and continue on foot at any time.\n\nGameplay takes place in huge outdoor levels which contain a variety of buildings and structures which will need to be explored on foot. The levels are in a \"modular\" format similar to Dark Forces or Aliens Versus Predator, in that instead of going from one level to the next, players are able to select any previous level from the new game menu. Unlike those games however, <i>Redline</i> has an ingame save feature which is good since it doesn't have an \"easy\" difficulty setting.\n\nThere are a total of twelve missions in the single player game which will take the player to locations such as Stadium City, Templar Strongholds, Battewheels combat tournaments and even Area 51.

The chaotic world of Monster Truck racing, with its huge jumps and wild slides, provides the basis. It offers straight racing with dirt track, circuit and drag modes, as well as specific challenges such as jumping over cars.\n\nThe goal is pretty much the same as in any racing game, except you have the option to stray very far from the tracks and find your own shortcuts. You have a selection of eight trucks to handle, and setting them up to suit the track is vital. Also included is multiplayer support, for modem, LAN and internet.",

The Monaco license is used, although the teams themselves are not licensed. A total of 22 camera views are provided.\n\nTelemetry is stored and analysed in a similar way to Grand Prix 2, and physics are modeled to be realistic. There are eight different modes to race, the new ones being a career mode in which you start with a poor team and must drive well enough to earn competitive rides, and scenarios recreating key races for particular drivers. Returning from the first game are Time Attack, a full championship, and a 50s retro mode. There is also a track editor to create your own tracks. ",

Sonic is not interested at first, but once he notices that Dr. Robotnik will participate he decides to enter. Robotnik is only interested in the race because he's learned the location of the Chaos Emeralds and now he'll get a chance to beat Sonic while he gets them. Knuckles finds out that Sonic will participate, so he joins him. Amy overhears Robotnik's plan, so she will also be racing to get the Chaos Emeralds.\r\n\r\nThere are many modes of gameplay in Sonic R:\r\n\r\nGrand Prix: You race against the rest of the characters on each of the circuits, and get a chance to race the level's boss to unlock some of the extra playable characters.\r\n\r\nTime Attack: Run on one of the tracks as fast as you can, get 5 balloons or tag 4 characters.\r\n\r\nMulti Player: 4 players on a split-screen or over a network. You can race against up to three players or challenge them on a balloon finding game. The screen can be divided horizontally or vertically for 2 player games. \r\n\r\n",

In both Arcade and Time Trial modes, getting through each of the gates in sequence is the challenge. The player may use the turbo boost, which improves performance both in straight line speed and steering. It will replenish itself as the player successfully passes the gates.\n\nThere are ten different tracks to race across, through the Pacific and Icy Fjords among other things. The eight different boats each have their own characteristics.\n\nGraphics and AI are updated from the first game. There are three difficulty levels to compete at.",

Instead of the F3600 anti-gravity racing competition, the game features an even faster and more dangerous tournament: the F5000 AG league. The gameplay system is similar to that of the previous game: players race against each other or computer in high-speed futuristic environments, liberally picking up weapons scattered around the stages and using them against the opponents to finish the race in the highest position.\n\nEach vehicle is provided with a shield; once this shield is breached (by weapons or other kinds of damage), the craft explodes. As in the first game, the vehicles move at very high speeds. The game's four difficulty levels are used to crank the speed up and down, with the highest setting corresponding to the highest speed. In addition to the main championship mode, there are also challenge modes, winning in which rewards the player with faster game settings, new tracks, and new vehicles.",

      "description": "<i>Dethkarz</i> is a fast, arcade-like racing game with futuristic cars and tracks. All courses are set high up in the air with slopes sides and gaps, and there is no invisible wall, so missing a corner leads to a deep fall where the car is picked up by an aircraft and placed back on the road. There are four main tracks (Metro City, Grand Keys, The Pole, and Red Planet) with three variations based on length, and three main game modes: Time Trial (with ghosts for the best times), Arcade and Championship. Multiplayer games are also supported.\n\nRaces are won by finishing first or by taking out all other cars before the final lap is completed. There are various power-ups such as a regular and an antimatter shield, a stealth mode (no collision with other cars is possible), quick repair, and nitro, as well as offensive pick-ups such as regular, heat-seeking and guided missiles, and a cluster bomb. These are presented as small cubes on the courses and the colour tells the player which kind of power-up it is. Only one power-up can be picked up at all times and when a new one is collected before it is activated, the earlier one is discarded. Cars also have a less powerful weapon by default: a pulse laser or a plasma cannon. Using it drains an energy meter that slowly recharges, and instead of bursts or short attacks it can also be charged to unleash a much more powerful attack. The use of weapons can be disabled in the options to make it a regular racing game. All courses have a pit lane where damage is restored by driving over highlighted areas. Cars are divided over four different teams with three tiers of cars. The statistics based on difficulty, speed, handling, acceleration, armour and the strength of the weapons. New tiers are unlocked by winning championships.\n\n",
