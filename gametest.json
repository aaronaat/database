      "description": "As an extension of one of the most long-running television series of all time, <i>The X-Files</i>, play through the eyes of Special Agent Craig Willmore, a new FBI field investigator brought in to locate missing agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully whose last location was the Everett, Washington, area. In this \"movie quality\" video production, characters are played by the actors and actresses from the show, including Gillian Anderson (Scully) and David Duchovny (Mulder).\n\nAs the game begins, you are given a briefing of your mission. Gather up all state-of-the-art spy tools (night vision goggles, a digital camera, PDA, lock picks, evidence kit, a standard issue revolver, handcuffs and badge) and then head out to follow their trail. As you explore the various locations, take photographs, pick up pieces of evidence and talk with people. Use your Newton PDA to access the navigational map, to make notes and send/receive e-mail. Trace telephone numbers, run background checks and license plate ids and even post an All Points Bulletin on missing persons using the computer network at your home or office. By using photo viewer software, download field photographs to the computer where they can be enlarged and studied more closely for clues.\n\nFeatures include emotion icons for interjecting different tones during conversations (mean, humorous or technical) which effect the answer given. An in-game hint system, Artificial Intelligence, can be set on or off. In addition, there are multiple endings as a direct result of actions you take.\n",

      "description": "This adventure game puts the player in the shoes of Rincewind, a wizard whose sole purpose in life is to stay alive. He appears to be very good at it as well, because apparently the universe has decided to continuously challenge him. The game takes place in the humorous fantasy world created by Terry Pratchett. The world is called the Discworld, as it is actually a flat disc carried on the backs of four gigantic elephants, which themselves stand on the back of an even larger turtle.\n\nThe story is loosely based on the novel \"Guards! Guards!\". Both in the book and the game, a dragon is summoned by a group of mysterious conspirators and now terrorizes the city state of Ankh-Morpork. Being the most expendable wizard of the Unseen University, Rincewind is given the task to get rid of the beast (only in the game though; in the book, the city's nightwatch has to deal with the problem).\n\n<i>Discworld</i> is a classical point-and-click adventure game with a few original features. For example, Rincewind's inventory is limited to two objects, and the majority of his belongings is stored in the Luggage, an intelligent chest with dozens of little feet. Furthermore, at a certain point in the game the player gains access to a time-traveling device and has to send Rincewind to the past and back in order to solve some of the puzzles.",

Before you know it the Captain is eaten alive by the cargo, a horrific monster with whom you are trapped aboard the submarine. And that's just the start of your problems.\n\n<i>Prisoner of Ice</i> features a very simplified version of the classic adventure game interface, where you can left click with the cursor to operate an object or right click to look at it.

He barely escapes a bombing of a caf\u00e9 and decides to investigate the clues left behind by the killer. This eventually leads him to a mystery dating back to the legend of the Knights Templar.\n\n<i>Circle of Blood</i> is the first part in the Broken Sword series. It is a third-person puzzle-solving point-and-click adventure game with 2D cartoon-like graphics. The player moves the character around using the mouse, examines the environment, talks to other people and collects items stored in an inventory. These items need to be used or combined with other items to solve puzzles. George gets help from Nicole Collard, a French journalist. The story is divided into eleven chapters and takes place in locations such as Paris, Ireland, Syria, and others.",

      "description": "Somewhere in the universe, there is a beautiful planet called Twinsun. It is populated by four different races, which have been living in peace and prosperity, until a mad scientist Dr. Funfrock of the Quetch (human-like) race used his newly invented cloning and teleporting techniques to create an army of fearsome soldiers and become the planet's dictator. Twinsun's inhabitants have not lost hope, placing their faith in the old legend about the benevolent goddess Sendell who would save the world. However, Dr. Funfrock totalitarian regime forbade displaying any images of the goddess and her worship. \n\nA young Quetch named Twinsen was just a regular fellow until he had a dream, which surprisingly involved the outlawed goddess. It seems that Dr. Funfrock was no stranger to mind control; in his opinion, even dreaming of the goddess was illegal, and he promptly ordered to put the perpetrator in prison. Now the unlikely hero must find a way to escape and eventually save his planet from the clutches of its insane ruler.\n\n<i>Little Big Adventure</i> (<i>Relentless: Twinsen's Adventure</i> in the US) is primarily an adventure game with strong action elements. As usually in adventure games, the hero must talk to other characters, and collect and use objects. However, not all the problems have to be solved with dialogue and item manipulation. The player can activate four different behavior modes for Twinsen: Normal, Aggressive, Athletic, and Discreet. The first is used for peaceful exploration and conversations; Aggressive mode allows Twinsen to punch and kick other characters; Athletic mode must be applied when it becomes necessary to run quickly and jump; Discreet effectively puts Twinsen in a stealth mode, making it possible to sneak by hostile character unnoticed. While activation of a particular mode is often required to solve a problem, many situations can be dealt with in different ways.\n\nThe game universe is rendered with characters in full 3D, while the environment uses isometric graphic tiles. The CD version (which was released earlier than the floppy one) features pre-rendered animated cutscenes, audio music and speech; all these features are absent from the floppy disk version.",

Each disk contains a fragment of a recording; gradually, the backstory is revealed as Klaymen finds more and more disks. It would spoil too much to reveal the exact plot, as finding it out is part of the game. \n\n<i>The Neverhood</i> is a point-and-click adventure game, notable for its claymation graphics. It uses a simple interface: you move and interact with the world by clicking on the screen. There is no inventory screen, though Klaymen can find a few items he can pick up. There are few inventory-based puzzles; most of the puzzles involve solving riddles and interacting with the environment. \n\nGenerally, the game is seen from a 3rd person perspective, but when moving between locales, you see the world through Klaymen's eyes (but you have a limited freedom of movement).

      "description": "<i>Broken Sword: The Smoking Mirror</i> is the sequel to Circle of Blood and the second game in the <i>Broken Sword</i> series. \n\nThe player alternately controls George Stobbart, the protagonist of the first game, and Nicole Collard, the French journalist he met in the first game and who has since become his girlfriend. The game starts with George witnessing the kidnapping of Nicole. This event eventually leads to an investigation into a conspiracy revolving around a forthcoming solar eclipse and the evil Aztec god Tezcatlipoca. The locations visited throughout the game include Paris, Marseilles, London, Quaramonte, the jungle, a Caribbean environment, and a zombie island. Certain locations from the previous game make a return.\n\nThe game is entirely in 2D and gameplay is in typical point-and-click fashion. The player moves the character around using the mouse, examines the environment, talks to other people, and collect items stored in an inventory. These items need to be used or combined with other items to solve puzzles.",

Upon arriving at this mysterious place however, not everything is as it should be. There's nobody to meet you and those who you do come across don't seem to have any knowledge about a sweepstakes. It looks like this is a private vacation and you'll need to find your own way through this land.\n\n<i>Return to Zork</i> is a first-person adventure game using live actors and video sequences. The game is similar to Myst in interface; the player is also able to rotate the viewpoint to discover new areas and uncover items that can be used or picked up. Various characters will be met along the way and spoken to via a system of dialog choices. The game allows the player to experiment with items in various ways, including discharging them; however, this often leads to \"dead ends\", rendering it impossible to complete the game.",

      "description": "You have just stumbled upon a most intriguing book, a book titled Myst. You have no idea where it came from, who wrote it, or how old it is. Reading through its pages provides you with only a description of an island world. But it's just a book, isn't it? As you reach the end of the book, you lay your hand on a page. Suddenly your own world dissolves into blackness, replaced with the island world the pages described. Now you're here, wherever here is, with no option but to explore.\n\n<i>Myst</i> is a first-person point-and-click adventure where the player controls a character known as The Stranger. Magically transported into the world described in the book, he needs to explore Myst Island and solve its mysteries. The game is presented as a series of static scenes where the player acts with the environment by clicking and manipulating objects. There are no enemies and it is not possible to die. Through Myst Island, the game is further divided into mini-worlds set in different ages accessed through different books. \n\nThe game's interface is reduced to a single cursor for navigation and interaction. Rather than collecting items and using them to solve puzzles, the player must gather subtly placed clues and manipulate complex mechanical devices in order to advance in the game. The world of <i>Myst</i> is mostly uninhabited, and the game has very few live-action scenes with characters and dialogue.",

      "description": "Nobody has expected it - but one day, something entered the solar system from outside. The mysterious object appeared to be a gigantic cylinder with unknown properties. The International Space Agency (ISA) sent the special Newton Team onto the object, which they dubbed \"Rama\". The scientists soon discovered that Rama was, in fact, a huge biomechanical collector of alien species and their cities. One of the explorers, Valeriy Borzov, dies under mysterious circumstances. Another astronaut is sent to replace him, investigate the circumstances that led to his death, and perhaps uncover the mystery of Rama.\n\n<i>Rama</i> is a puzzle-solving adventure game based on Arthur C. Clarke's series of science fiction novels. Visually and gameplay-wise, it mostly follows the template of Myst, consisting of pre-rendered backgrounds and live action scenes, and focusing almost entirely on complex logic puzzles. The player character has a special device called \"wristcomp\", which includes communicative, automapping, and teleporting abilities. A personal android provides descriptions of objects and comments on the events of the game.",

Atrus's wife, Catherine, has been taken by Gehn, his own father. Gehn has appointed himself as the one to rule the Age of Riven, and has driven his world to collapse. Now he holds Catherine hostage on Riven, hoping that his son will restore the book link to the Age and free him from there. The Stranger is requested by Atrus to travel to Riven and find a way to rescue Catherine.\n\n<i>Riven</i> is a sequel to  Myst, and is very similar to its predecessor in gameplay style, controls, and visual presentation. The game world is presented as a series of computer-generated still screens; the player explores it in a point-and-click fashion. Interaction with the environment is possible only when said environment is highlighted as a \"hot spot\", and is also performed by simple clicking. Like its predecessor, <i>Riven</i> is heavy on puzzles, which rarely include using inventory items, but usually involve understanding and manipulating the complex environments and machinery of the game world.

      "description": "Ankh-Morpork is a city surrounded by darkness, where the cold river Ankh flows, where it always rains, and where dwarves and trolls co-exist with secret societies, religious fanatics, stupid police captains, and bar pianists. It is also where a bitterly sarcastic sharp-eyed private investigator named Lewton tries to earn a living solving bizarre cases. A mysterious woman named Carlotta hires him to find her lost lover. Wandering through the dark city and gathering evidence, Lewton has to solve the case, confront a sinister conspiracy, and once again become torn between love and despair.\n\n<i>Discworld Noir</i> differs from other <i>Discworld</i> adventure games not only thanks to its more serious tone and much darker \"film noir\" atmosphere, but also because of its gameplay. Instead of inventory-based puzzles there are clues, which Lewton writes down in his notebook and which should be then used whenever there is a connection between the clue and the situation in question. Most of the gameplay is thus dedicated to detective work in conversations; but the usage of the right clues at the right place is still comparable to inventory-based puzzle-solving of other adventures. Graphically, <i>Discword Noir</i> features three-dimensional character models and pre-rendered backgrounds.",

      "description": "A number of games allow you to search the tombs of ancient Egypt, but few allow you to do so IN ancient Egypt. Taking place (appropriately enough) in 1156 B.C., you play Ramose, a young Egyptian man who hopes to prove himself a worthy investigator for the current rulers of Egypt. Your first assignment is not an easy one, as a Tomb of Sethi I, a pharaoh has been desecrated and looted and your own father has been accused of the crime. You have three days to prove his innocence and stay the sentence of execution.\r\n\r\nGameplay takes place in a first person mode similar to fans of this kind of adventure game. Unlike some games that give you a static, unmoving image to look at, Egypt 1156 B.C. allows you to look around at any location in a smooth turn (similar to QuickTime VR, but with better results). This gives you a 'you are there' feel that many other games lack. All graphics are 3-D rendered and occassionally actions will give you a third person cutscene as a reward. Communication is through a simple branch tree and both talking and puzzle solving involves the manipulation of objects, both in and out of your inventory. \r\n\r\nIn addition to being a mystery/adventure game, Egypt 1156 B.C. also comes with reference material about ancient Egypt, its people, and its culture. These are available whenever you discover something interesting in the middle of the game or can be accessed via the main menu. ",

      "description": "In the near future, Cold War has reignited between USA and People's Republic of China. CIA has requested assistance of British MI6 to send an agent into Volgia, a fictional state under control of General Nagarov which he founded after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The player takes control of John Cord, MI6 agent chosen for the assignment. His investigation turns out to be anything but simple.\n\n<i>In Cold Blood</i> has characteristics of an adventure game, a stealth game, and a shooter. It relies on puzzle-solving but also includes action segments. Progress in the game is mostly achieved by collecting items and talking to various characters to find clues. Many conversations consist of multiple-choice dialogues. At certain points it is necessary to use stealth to proceed undetected, or attempt to solve the situation violently. Combat is fairly simple and consists of melee fighting (punches) or shooting.",

      "description": "In <i>Angel Devoid: Face of the Enemy</i>, which is set in the futuristic NeoCity of the year 3032, the player takes the role of Jack Hard, a cop whose life goal is to hunt the criminal Angel Devoid. After an accident during a car chase he awakens in an hospital - only to find out that his face was operated to look like his eternal enemy. Now he is a wanted man...\n\nThe controls of the game are similar to The 7th Guest: in a first-perspective view the player clicks on interactive items and a video clip shows the result. The game is designed to give an expression of the time pressure the protagonist is under - he has to react fast or he dies. This is also true when meeting other characters; in many situations Jack needs to use his gun to avoid being killed. Often he runs into conversations with people and robots instead of shooting them directly; then the player doesn't choose the exact answer but only the mood (aggressive, passive or normal) Jack answers in. The wrong approach may result in death. \n\nThe protagonist can't walk freely through the city; the game consists of several single screens which have to be left by clicking on an exit, followed by a walking animation. There are quite a few places to visit, e.g. bars or a museum, but choosing the wrong path or hot spot generally leads to an instant death. There are also a few basic inventory-based puzzles to solve.

When Harry gets closer to town, he sees that same motorcycle sprawled in the middle of the road.  Harry also spots a woman standing in the road, but due to the dense fog, he can't stop in time, so he swerves to avoid her, crashing into a railing, knocking him unconscious.\r\n\r\nWhen Harry wakes up, his daughter, Cheryl, is missing.  Sensing that she would head to the town to seek help, Harry sets out on a journey, not knowing what to expect from this eerie town, enshrouded with fog.\r\n\r\nYou play Harry Mason, a normal man, with no powers or training of any kind.  You must search through the town of Silent Hill, looking for your daughter.  You will come across many people, some friendly, some not.  You must visit many different areas, such as the school, and the church.\r\n\r\nWill Harry find his daughter and safely get out, or is there more to this town than a simple fog layer?",

Wanting to prove that the white birds existed, Alexandre stole the mysterious egg and betrayed the natives' trust Returning to France, nobody believed Alexandre or his journals about the Amerzone. Sixty years have passed and the world has changed. World War 2 has come and gone, the Amerzone remains unexplored and closed off to outsiders by it's despotic leader, Anoino Alverez. Monsieur Alexandre Valembois is an old man at the end of his life, living alone in a lighthouse and wishing to fix his mistake. At this time, a young reporter comes to visit the old Alexandre Valembois regarding his adventures...\n\nAmerzone is a first person adventure game, similar to Myst, taking place between different rooms and areas. The player assumes the role of the reporter and must unravel the clues left by Monsieur Valembois, travelling over several picturesque locations and eventually reaching the fictional Amerzone region. The adventure game takes place over a series of areas. The player can click on arrow icons to change the orientation or to move to different areas. Objects of interest change the cursor to a magnifying glass icon. Objects that can be interacted with or picked up change the cursor to a hand icon. An icon of gears represents a mechanism which must be manipulated before it can be properly used. The player's inventory can be accessed at any time.",

The captain has been murdered, an assassin threatens a visiting senior Senator, and a power struggle arises as the station careens toward the sun. Save yourself, or save the ship?\n\n<i>Sentient</i>'s main feature is the artificial intelligence controlling multiple individual crew members aboard the station, each with their own assignments and behaviors. You interact with the AI characters through an elaborate parser interface, which allows you to ask them everything from the location of a vital piece of equipment, to their opinion of another member of the crew. To succeed, you must take advantage of the crew's help through this social system.",

Toc-Man and his ghosts have kidnapped Pac-Man's friends, Ms. Pac-Man, Pac Jr., Baby Pac, Professor Pac, Pooka, and Chomp-Chomp the dog!  Pac-Man must venture to Toc-Man's lair on Ghost Island to rescue his friends!\n\nHidden through this 3D adventure game, Pac-Man faces challenging puzzles and games that have appeared in Pac-Man's previous games.  Many things in this game are a tribute to original games and even Inky, Blinky, Pinky, and Clyde are back for another chance to get Pac-Man.\n\nThere are several kinds of gameplay modes available.  The newest is Quest mode.  Pac-Man can maneuver up/down and left/right on the screen, but the camera is fixed on the side and scrolls along as Pac-Man searches through all the stages of Ghost Island.  The player must collect Pac-Dots, Fruit, Keys, etc to advance through the level all the while defeating ghosts (by bouncing on them) and solving puzzles.  An adventure game, the story progresses as the levels do with switches to be found and chests to be opened.  There is also a scoring system that encourages the player to collect as much as possible. \n\nThe other two types of modes are Classic mode and Maze mode.  Classic mode is a 100% faithful conversion of Pac-Man's original game.  Maze Mode is the gameplay from Classic Pac-Man translated into a 3D environment.  All the Pac-Pellets, Ghosts, Walls, and Pac-Man are displayed in 3D.",

The perpetrator is the director of the hospital, Richter Harris. He has shut himself up in the hospital and taken a number of patients as hostages, leaving the police helpless and unable to move in. Richter's only daughter, Laura Harris, after hearing the situation, rushes to Los Angeles from San Francisco, and drives alone to the tragic scene at the hospital ground. Upon entering the hospital Laura finds herself transported to an old mansion, while the disembodied voice of her father pleads with her to leave. Nevertheless she must press forward to save her father and herself.\n\n<i>D</i> is a puzzle game requiring Laura to solve esoteric inventory puzzles on a very strict time limit. Each of the game's four discs must be completed in about thirty minutes each, and saving is not an option. The time is kept track of using Laura's pocket watch. The pocket watch can also be used to supply hints for puzzles, but after three uses the glass will shatter and it will stop working. The game also has multiple endings. ",

      "description": "The fantasy world of Gothos is populated by two kinds of people: the Dreamers, who are capable of using magic, and the Steamers, whose civilization relies on technology. The two peoples live in separate areas, mistrust each other, and usually avoid contact. But more often than not, natural human feelings are stronger than anything else. A Steamer man and a Dreamer woman fell in love with each other, and the fruit of their passion was a boy whom they named Melvin. The latter grew up in Dreamertown, disliked and suspected by its inhabitants because of his mixed blood. As monsters suddenly attacked the town, Melvin was blamed for it, and expelled from his homeland. He decides to venture into the land of the Steamers and find his missing father. Naturally, this is just the beginning of a long and perilous journey, during which Melvin will become a true hero.\n\n<i>TechnoMage: Return of Eternity</i> is a hybrid game that incorporates elements of adventure, role-playing, and action-based combat. Many of the game's missions involve peaceful wandering through the environments, talking to characters, and performing tasks that often involve solving puzzles of various kinds, in an adventure-like fashion. RPG elements are present in experience points which the hero receives form eliminating enemies and completing quests. ",

She went to school, joined a cheerleading club, and loved sports. She lived with her brother and father in a nice house in the Tokyo suburb of Tomoeda, and was pretty led a normal life.\n\nThen one day, while home alone, she found a mysterious book in her father's study, called \"CLOW\". What she didn't realize was that book would change her life...she opened it and released a powerful deck of magic cards; alive with souls and unspeakable powers. The cards scattered across Tokyo, and the Guardian Beast of the Seal, Kerberos, has put her in charge of gathering the cards back up.\n\nThe birth of a Cardcaptor, Sakura Kinomoto! Now Sakura must locate all of the cards, aided by Kerberos, her best friend Tomoyo Daidouji, and a mysterious boy from Hong Kong named Shaoran Li. Together, the four must find all the cards before chaos is unleashed on the world!\n\n<i>Cardcaptor Sakura</i> is a very simple adventure game. Typically, the player navigates Sakura on a very brief and linear path, until a mini-game and/or an anime-style cutscene takes place. The mini-games are quite simple as well, usually involving timed sequences and patterns.",

      "description": "<i>Snatcher</i> is set in the futuristic Neo Kobe City, a city of madness and decadence. The year is 2047 (or 2042, according to the original Japanese version). Mankind is facing its gravest crisis. A mysterious bio-roid life form has appeared. Its true nature and purpose are unknown. Is it some country's secret weapon, or an alien from another world? They appear in the winter, killing people and taking their place in society. They wear artificial skin and can sweat and even bleed. They are called \"Snatchers\" because they \"snatch\" their victims before they take their place.\n\nA new police force, specifically trained to fight the Snatchers, has been formed. They are JUNKERs (which is deciphered as \"Japanese Undercover Neuro-Kinetic Elimination Rangers\" in the English version). Every time you encounter someone, a difficult question must be asked \u2014 is it a person or a snatcher? \n\nThe player takes control of Gillian Seed, one of the JUNKERs. The gameplay largely follows the structure of a Japanese-style adventure. The player uses a menu-driven interface to execute commands, which include moving between locations and interacting with the environment. Typically, every room contains objects that can be examined, leading to text descriptions and comments. Conversations occupy a large portion of the gameplay, with various topics available and a wealth of information about the game's world and characters. A few parts contain light puzzle-solving elements, though as a rule the game is almost completely devoid of puzzles.\n\nDuring key moments of the narrative, the player will be prompted to participate in intense shooting sequences. The goal is usually to kill all the enemies that pop out on the screen before they are able to kill Gillian. Some of such sequences are timed, i.e. the player is required to quickly shoot before another events is triggered, leading to the protagonist's death.",

In this twist on the King Arthur legend, the player controls a young dragon named Flicker who lives in the kingdom of Camelhot. Flicker is an inventor who wants to become a knight and win a tournament. The prize is the hand in marriage of Princess Flame, Flicker's lifelong love interest. The player must solve puzzles to defeat the evil mechanical Black Dragon, the human race's entry into the tournament. The gameplay is mostly straight inventory-based point-and-click, but there are several arcade sequences that the player must successfully complete in order to progress.",

Just like in the fairytale, a huge beanstalk emerges from the beans and open up new worlds and - supposedly - greast treasures. The player takes control over Plucky while they explore eight different areas in a scavenger hunt based on nursery rhymes.  Prizes include the goose that laid the golden eggs and a fabled, priceless harp. The comical quest takes our heroes through classic nursery rhyme locations based on <i>Little Red Riding Hood</i>, <i>The Three Bears</i>, <i>Old Mother Hubbard</i> and more.\n\nThe game consists of two parts: First are the sequences on the beanstalk where Plucky tries to reach the next treasure location. Those are platforming sections in which the end of the screen needs to be reached without dying to one of the many obstacles, for example by rolling to the side when a weight appears and threatens to bury Plucky. An optional hard difficulty adds additional hazards and traps.\n\nWhen the clue locations are reached, the game becomes a point & click adventure. Based on a clue provided by Babs Bunny, Plucky needs to find the correct item to click on. Each location consists of a single screen and has a number of optional hot-spots which launch animations.\nWhen the the item was found, Plucky receives part of a key; three parts of a key open up the chance to steal a valuable prize from the mysterious giant. \n\n",

      "description": "In the year 2010 mankind has built its first space colony, Beyond Coast. Three years later the founders of the colony felt it needed to be protected, and chose five best policemen from Earth to do that: Gates Becker from Scotland Yard, the Japanese Sadaoki Tokugawa, Salvatore Toscanini from New York, and two policemen from Los Angeles: Jonathan Ingram and his best friend Ed Brown. During a routine patrol on Beyond Coast, something happened to Jonathan's space suit. He was sucked into space and presumed dead. Twenty-five years later, he is miraculously discovered in his life pod, alive. He still looks like a young man, but in reality he is fifty-five years old.\n\nTrying to forget his past, Jonathan opens an investigation agency on Earth. One day, his ex-wife unexpectedly pays him a visit. She has re-married during Jonathan's prolonged absence, and asks him to find her missing husband. When she leaves the office, her car explodes, and she dies. Determined to fulfill her final request, Jonathan prepares to re-visit Beyond Coast.\n\n<i>Policenauts</i> is a Japanese-style adventure with action elements, similar in many ways to Snatcher. The player interacts with the environment in a point-and-click fashion: positioning a cursor over an object allows the player character to examine it or perform other context-dependent actions. There are a few puzzles in the game, but most of the time the story is advanced by visiting various locations, examining objects, and talking to characters. Conversations usually include a selection of topics. \n\nAction sequences are similar to those of <i>Snatcher</i>, but are more numerous and varied. The player must rapidly shoot enemies moving within a one-screen area viewed from a first-person perspective, reloading the gun manually and trying to eliminate the enemy before Jonathan's health bar is depleted.

A girl named Mana Kirishima arrives at Tokyo-3 and studies in the same class with Shinji Ikari, the series' main hero. About the same time, a giant robot attacks the city. Is there a connection between the new student and the sudden assault?\n\nUnlike the two previous <i>Neon Genesis Evangelion</i> games, <i>K\u014dtetsu no Girlfriend</i> is not an interactive movie. The player controls Shinji by selecting locations to travel to, looking at people, and talking to them. The locations are graphically represented as anime-style still screens. ",

      "description": "<i>Eve Zero</i> is a prequel to Eve Burst Error. Once again, the player controls the two main heroes of the series: the witty and womanizing private investigator Kojiroh Amagi, and the beautiful red-haired secret agent Marina. The events of the game take place shortly before those of <i>Eve Burst Error</i>. Kojiroh is working at Katsuragi Detective Office together with his girlfriend Yayoi. Dr. Nishina, the head of a genetic research facility, hires Kojiroh to investigate the disappearance of his son Shin. At the same time, Marina receives an assignment from her boss Kohno, which involves watching over a representative of an American company. As in all EVE games, the two stories appear unrelated in the beginning and are gradually linked together later in the game.\n\nThe player needs to switch between the two protagonists frequently in order to advance in the game. The interface consists of a menu that makes it possible to interact with the game world. Beside the traditional \"Look\", \"Talk\", and \"Go\" commands, there are many others, specific to the situation. Being a Japanese-style adventure game, <i>Eve Zero</i> does not feature any puzzles.",

It tells the story of a simple Japanese teenager Yakumo, who lives in Tokyo and tries to study at his high school and to earn his living by working as a cross-dressing waiter at the same time. His father was a famous explorer and adventurer, but he died after a mysterious accident during one of his journeys to Tibet. One day, Yakumo meets a girl who calls herself Pai. She tells him that she belongs to an ancient powerful race of immortals, called the sanzhiyan, the three-eyed ones. It appears that Yakumo's father worked together with Pai, and that Pai's biggest wish is to become a normal human again. Since then, Yakumo and Pai work together, but they must be aware of other sanzhiyan - powerful demons with their own evil plans.\n\nThe story of the game is based on the following episode: Yakumo receives a message from his friend, the Buddhist monk Naparvha, saying that a curse has fallen upon a village in China. A young girl was killed under mysterious circumstances, and two monks fell asleep and cannot wake up. Yakumo visits the village and begins the investigation, aided by Yue Hua, the sister of the dead girl. \n\nThe game is a Japanese-style adventure. The game world is composed of still shots of locations and characters in anime style, and the player interacts with objects and characters by selecting choices from a menu (such as \"Look\", \"Talk\", etc.). Cutscenes are presented as animated sequences. ",

      "description": "A little boy likes to play video games. Day and night he sits in front of his GameStation and plays a game called <i>Moon</i>: a typical Japanese RPG with a sword-wielding hero who kills monster after monster on his grand epic quest. Skipping through the boring, cliche story, the boy continues to play until his mother tells him to stop and go to bed. However, the TV on which he was just playing the game miraculously turns itself on, and the boy is sucked into the world of <i>Moon</i>, a fantasy land called Love-de-Gard. \n\nIt turns out that the hero of the game that the boy was playing is a troublesome individual, who does nothing else but slaughter various creatures populating the land, barge into people's houses bothering them with questions and taking their possessions without asking, and complain that he \"can't reach the final dungeon\". Souls of the animals the hero has killed find no rest, and the land's inhabitants are horrified. The boy realizes that there can only be one answer to that: love.\n\n<i>Moon: Remix RPG Adventure</i> is an adventure game with light role-playing elements that parodies the RPG genre by presenting a situation in which the player character must act in a way opposite to the usual behavior of typical RPG protagonists. There is no combat in the game. Core gameplay resembles that of adventure games: the player explores various locations, talks to characters and solves problems in a non-violent way. The game's world is open-ended, and story progression is non-linear. The world has a day and night cycle as well as an internal calendar, with people following their own schedules daily. \n\nThe main goal consists of raising the protagonist's \"love level\", which is achieved by fulfilling people's wishes. In many cases it is not immediately obvious what people really wish for, and the player has to gather clues and learn more about the game world's inhabitants in order to find a way to make a particular character happy. Some of these activities are timed. Soul-catching, i.e. resurrecting the animals killed by the hero of the game <i>Moon</i>, is one of the ways to increase the love level. Amassing love points raises the \"action limit\", which is the amount of time the boy can stay in Love-de-Gard. If the action limit falls to zero, the game is over.",

      "description": "<i>Tenrin \u014c Genmu</i> is one of the games based on the manga and anime series <i>3x3 Eyes</i>. It tells the story of Yakumo, a normal Japanese teenager who studies and works as a waiter, and Pai, a girl who belongs to the race of sanzhiyan, the immortal three-eyed people. After having discovered the secret of eternal youth and immortality many hundred years ago, the sanzhiyan could not remain human, and became cruel demons capable of possessing people and turning them into \"wu\" (Chinese for \"nothing\") - immortal, powerful, and obedient servants. Pai, who looks like a young girl, but is nevertheless three hundred years old, was terrified by what the sanzhiyan have become, and swore she will find a way to become human again. She meets Yakumo, whose late father was a scientist who helped Pai on her quest. Accidentally, Pai uses the powers of her third eye on Yakumo, and he becomes her Wu! Trying to regain their lost humanity, Yakumo and Pai are confronted by the evil Benares, the Wu of the sanzhiyan ruler Kaiyanwang. In pursuit of Benares and his henchmen, Yakumo and Pai travel to India, the Easter Island, and many other countries. Will they be able to stop Benares and become human again?\n\nThe game is a puzzle-less adventure in Japanese fashion, which plays like an interactive anime. The game contains many animated cutscenes, and the locations of the game are still shots in anime style. Unlike most Japanese adventures, the player interacts with the game world not by choosing commands from a menu, but by moving a cursor on the screen. Once the cursor is placed on an object possible to interact with, it is highlighted with an additional command, such as \"look\", \"talk\", etc. ",

A mysterious item that was hidden thousand years ago will play an important role in the events of today and tomorrow...\n\n1200 BC. Total obedience is what the God demands from the people. Humans have no free will, but they believe that their obedience will bring them reward. The protagonist in this time period is the \"flame priest\" Ales who serves the God. 200X AD - many good and evil powers are present in the world of our time, but the treasure hunter Kasumi Shindou is only interested in one thing - to find a treasure and become rich, and nothing and nobody will stop him. In the future, 13800 AD, the skies have became black, the oceans are red, and the earth is on the verge of a disaster - Sui, the last descendant of a royal dynasty, and her friends decide to undertake something to change the reality. \n\n<i>Exodus Guilty</i> is a visual novel featuring the so-called \"Multitime Zapping System\", which allows you to play as Ales, Kasumi, and Sui in their respective time periods, switching between them when necessary. You have to gather various items and to coordinate your actions in the past so that the future will be changed. The gameplay relies largely on dialogues (at certain points you are able to choose one of several available answers). You can also navigate your characters from first-person perspective (pressing arrows that point to different directions). You also have a party - people who join the main protagonists and help them in their quests.\n\nThe Dreamcast release, <i>Exodus Guilty Neos</i>, adds full voice acting but is otherwise identical in content.",

The game was called by their creators a <i>sound novel</i>. \n\nThe idea of the game is to let the players experience five days in the lives of eight different characters. They all live somewhere in the city, each one preoccupied with his (or her) own problems. Their paths might cross without them realizing it. At any point in the game, you can switch between characters, but when you do so, the day or the time of the day of the other character corresponds to the one you are currently having. \n\nThe eight protagonists are: Keima Amemiya, a policeman; Jintaro Umabe, an actor; Masami Ushio, a gang member; Yoshiko Hosoi, without a particular profession (the only female protagonist in the game); Masashi Shinoda, a student; Ryuji Takamine, a deserter; Fumiyasu Ichikawa, a writer; and Yohei Tobisawa, a high-school boy. You control the characters by making decisions for them: where to go next, how to answer to another character, etc. In many cases, there are wrong decisions which lead to a premature end (bad ending). The story is presented through text (without voices) and still shots of live actors and locations, with occasional short animated sequences. ",

      "description": "This is a side story to Konami's RPG series  Suikoden. The events of the game take place between the second and the upcoming third game, and fill the story gap between them. The story centers on the rebellion that has taken place in the Grasslands. It has been three months since the end of the Dunan Unification Wars. A legend telling about the Fire Brigands lead by the mysterious Fire Champion who united the Grassland nations is being spread around. Is the legend true, and can the Fire Champion, a holder of one of the 27 True Runes, be found? Nash, a special agent of Holy Kingdom of Harmonia's Southern Fringe Security Force, is sent to investigate the matter.\r\n\r\nYou take control over Nash' actions in a fashion similar to the one implemented in Japanese \"dating sims\" or some hentai games: reading the text, looking at the background images, and sometimes interfering and choosing the path on which the story should proceed.",

The sex scenes were removed, and the scenario expanded in this game up to the point of being a sequel to \"Adam\".\r\n\r\nYou control the two main heroes of the game, the young careless detective Kojiroh and the sexy red-haired super-spy Marina. The events of the game are connected to their previous investigation (in  Eve Burst Error). Kojiroh's ex-girlfriend and colleague, Yayoi Katsuragi, receives a case: somebody is threatening the life of two young girls, Mika and Miki, the daughters of the owner of the powerful Andou Corporation. Naturally, Yayoi needs Kojiroh's help, and here the investigation truly begins!\r\n\r\nLike in other Eve games, you control two characters in two \"scenarios\", and sometimes the cooperation between them is necessary. The game utilizes the same \"Touchable View\" that was implemented in \"Adam\": you interact with the environment and with the characters not by selecting menu options, but by moving the cursor around and clicking on objects, like in Western point-and-click adventures.",

      "description": "The future Tokyo is a megapolis built on top of a huge system of underground tunnels and sewers. A rumor is heard that in this underground world hide the followers of a mysterious cult, known as the Dark Messiah. At the same time a symbiotic life form escapes from scientists and makes it's way into the sewer system. There it causes the crash of a subway train and starts devouring the passengers on board. A lone hero, along with a schoolgirl Naomi Sugiura are the only survivors of the crash.... and must flee from the creature in order to survive.\n\n<i>Hellnight</i> is a survival horror game at heart, although it has no combat gameplay. Controlling the nameless hero, the player must travel through the underground and protect Naomi. There is only one monster in the whole game, the \"creature\" itself, which is invulnerable and cannot be killed. Instead players are constantly on the run from it, making sure it does not catch them. The game is divided into large maze-like levels, each one usually populated by the creature who keeps pursuing the player (although he does change form after each level). At certain points there will be companions who can attack the monster and temporarily stun him. There are also people to talk to in the underground world, items to pick up, and puzzles to solve.",

You are a high-school student, whose father is a famous archaeologist traveling around the world, and whose mother died when he was a child. It is now your third year at the 88 High School, and naturally, your primary concern is your love life. Will you be able to date successfully and to come to a happy ending with one of the fifteen lovely female classmates?\n\nThe game mechanics are a lot like in a \"standard\" adventure game (examine objects, visit various locations, talk to people, make decisions), but the plot centers exclusively around your relationship with the girls. The game has its own internal clock. You can move around your character on a \"city map\", visiting different locations. Every visit takes 20-30 minutes of game time. You can make appointments and visit various places at a specific time. The decisions you make influence the story.",

(Coalition Against Totalitarian Society) which will presumably use the information to wrest control from Chegga.  In selling this information, the goal is also to be gaining enough money to purchase a train ticket, leave this part of the world, and try to make a better life.\n\nThe way the plot is laid out, it is unclear whether the player's character is out to rid the world of a tyrant or simply in it for the money.",

Do it right and you can use your power effectively, do it wrong and you'll give Athena a psychic backlash and drain her health. \"Action\" sequences play the same but involve tighter time limits and a turn-based system in which you must avoid enemy attacks in order to successfully use your powers.",

Casper will need the help of Dr James Harvey - therapist to the dead - if he has any hope of succeeding in his adventures.\n\nCasper will also have to deal with his uncles - Stretch, Stinkie and Fatso, who just love to scare \"Fleshies\" and thwart Casper's efforts.

Where the biggest change lies, of course, is in the transition from the text parser to an interface controllable by a console's joystick.  Adapting some sentence-construction conventions from the graphical adventure game genre (and the interfaces of Lucasfilm's and Legend's early entries in particular), menus selectable with a joystick pointer fill in for common \"action\" verbs while icons represent the inventory items the verbs influence; an expanded compass rose permits precise navigation of the Flatheadian ruins. (Alas!  No secret joystick-button combination for \"xyzzy\"!)\n\nIn short: as faithful a reproduction of the original experience as you're going to find without employing a keyboard or voice-recognition software, plus \"modern\" graphics, sound and music!",

      "description": "Inspired by the <i>Oz</i> Books by L. Frank Baum, <i>Yellow Brick Road</i> concerns the player's attempt to thwart an invasion of the Emerald City by the Gnome King. Along the way s/he teams up with the tin man, lion, and eventually the scarecrow. Besides these, other recognizable figures from the books include Jack Pumpkinhead, the little Wizard of Oz, and Glinda, who, in the game, is queen of Oz. \n\nThe game's structure is reminiscent of first-person adventures: the player interacts with the environment and manipulates inventory items to proceed. The puzzles, however, are kept to a minimum, since combat occupies a significant portion of the game, effectively turning it into a hybrid of adventure and small-scale real-time strategy.\n\nBattles usually occur as dictated by the plot. The player does not fight directly, but instead acts as a general to his/her companions. Each character has a quick but weak base attack or can use one of the items found throughout the game. Many of the items act differently depending on who uses them. For instance, the flute calls field mice into battle for the Tin Woodman, while it calls crows into battle for the Scarecrow.  The more powerful the item, the longer the downtime for the character who has used it before he can fight again. The enemies progress toward the companions' side of the battlefield at a constant pace.  If they reach them, the battle is lost, and the player must try again.  If instead the player manages to push them back off the far side of the field, the battle is won and the game progresses. Different enemies are more greatly affected by different weapon/character combinations, and immune against some. ",

The third division is to be disbanded, but he appeals to the director, and is given one year to restore the third division to its former glory.\n\n<i>Y\u016bky\u016b Gens\u014dkyoku: 2nd Album</i> follows directly after the events of the first game, and is once more a traditional Japanese adventure game.

      "description": "Tokyo, the 21st century. The internet has grown to be an enormously important part of life, and a digital world called \"Cyberland\" has come into existence. This digital world is divided into eight levels, with more important and confidential information being granted higher levels of priority, with the highest levels being inaccessible to anyone other than those with the highest government security clearance.\n\nA young junior-high student named Alice Minazuki is the daughter of one of the developers of this system. He left her with a very special \"dive system,\" which allows the user to enter the deepest parts of Cyberland. Together with her friends Rena Ohtori and Juri Yagami, they are ALICE-3, a team tasked with maintaining peace and order in Cyberland.\n\n<i>Alice in Cyberland</i> is a traditional Japanese-style adventure game divided into chapters. Each chapter begins with Alice and her friends in Tokyo, and you can move about the city talking to people to find out more about what's happening. Eventually, she'll need to \"dive\" into Cyberland, which is also represented by a city. Your team will be able to move around, investigating different systems and looking for information, and eventually running into enemy \"guard programs\" which must be fought. The battle system is simple, allowing for either attack, defense, and character change. Defeating a guard system will continue the story.\n\nWhile exploring Tokyo, you can also visit an arcade and play a game, or go to a Karaoke club and watch the girls sing. The game's scenario was written by Chiaki Konaka, better known for his work on <i>serial experiments lain</i>, <i>The Big O</i>, and <i>Ultraman</i>.",
